# The loadpci syntax is as follows:
# 
#     loadpci [<option>...] <program> 
# 
# The options supported are:
# 
# 	-B	Use BSD43 ioctls to read interface list, broadcast addresses,
# 			and subnet masks.
# 
# 	-N...	Use specified device name for net opens.  If name doesn't
# 			start with a '/', a "/dev/" is prepended.  This option
# 			is also sent through to the program.
# 
# 	-P...	Specifies port number.  It should be specified as "CONSVR" or
# 			"MAPSVR" to use our defined ports.
# 
# 	-S	Subnets should be used as read from the system.  If this
# 			option is not specified, the subnet masks will be
# 			set to the network portion only.
# 
# 	-b	Broadcasts are not received locally.  This option adds an
# 			interface of the local host so that the local mapsvr
# 			will see its consvr-here packets.
# 
# 	-n	Network descriptor.  This option must not be specified.
# 
# Any other option specified are sent directly to the underlying program.  The
# specified program is exec'd after loadpci opens the network, and reads the
# interface list.
# 
# 
# The options currently supported by the consvr are:
# 
# 	-D...	Specifies the debug level for the consvr.  0 means no debugging.
# 			-Dffff means full debugging.
# 
# 	-F...	Specifies feature file.  This file contains the feature
# 			information used by the consvr.  This is currently only
# 			used by NTYs.
# 
# 	-L...	Specifies the debug level for the dossvrs that are spawned.
# 
# 	-x	Tells the consvr not to disconnect dossvrs when they time out.
# 
# 	-T...	Specifies the CONSVR_HERE retransmission time.
# 
# 
# The options currently supported by the mapsvr are:
# 
# 	-D...	Debug level of the mapsvr.
#

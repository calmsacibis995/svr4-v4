# default printer program (replace with your own)

# charconv converts from the DOS code page to the UNIX code set,
# ensuring that printer output is readable.

# NOTE: The UNIX server provides the following variables to
#       this shell script: -i %1 -o %2
#       where %1 is the input code page (the DOS code page)
#       and %2 is the output code set (the UNIX code set)
#       Thus the arguments are exactly what charconv needs
#       to perform a proper conversion from the DOS side 
#       to the UNIX side.

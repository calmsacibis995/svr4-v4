The USL tapes arrived today. There are two 6250 tapes which I have
extracted using tcopy into vangogh:/c/V.4.

/c/V.4/tape1: 1 file, 5120 sized blocks, 5081 records, total length 26014720
/c/V.4/tape2: 1 file, 5120 sized blocks, 2241 records, total length 11473920

Based on the blocksize I would guess that they are cpio, though a quick
try at using cpio yielded `cpio: This is not a cpio file.  Bad magic number.'
However, I am not sure I was using all the right options.

The label on tape1 reads:

UNIX
System Laboratories
UNIX SYSTEM V/386 RELEASE 4 - V4
Domestic Source Package - Source Code, Tape 1 of 1

The label on tape2 reads:

In addition there are 44 floppies. All but one claim to be binary
code. For example: Non-SCSI Boot - Binary Code. The one floppy that
does not claim to be binary code is listed as a `Source Code -
Patch'. According to the accompanying documentation, it contains
a fix for a bug that allowed executables to be modified.  The file
manifest is:

	/usr/src/uts/i386/os/machdep.c
	/usr/src/uts/i386/os/trap.c
	/usr/src/uts/i386/vm/ucopy.c
	/usr/src/uts/i386/sys/user.h
	/usr/src/uts/i386/sys/vmparam.h

I doubt that we will need to extract it for the purposes of our
investigation.

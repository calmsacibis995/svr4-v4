\f3os/exec.c\f1 is typically completely portable.
However, there are some items worthy exceptions.
The modifications to the routines in \f3exec.c\f1 is dependent largely
on the compiler's implementation of variable arguments on your system and
the direction of stack growth.
The 3B2 stack grows upward toward a positive address.
If your system has a similar stack growth, then fewer changes will be required
than if the stack grows downward toward a negative address.
The machine dependent interface routine in \f3exec\f1 is \f4extractarg()\f1.
See \f3os/machdep.c\f1 for further details.
.P
The exec switch architecture was designed to support executables with unique 
magic numbers as the first two bytes.
In a 386 environment supporting MS-DOS\(rg programs several DOS executables such
as COM and BAT do not have any magic numbers.
The switch mechanism should be modified to adjust for such executables. 
.P
Your specific architecture may require additional u-area variables to be 
initialized.
This should be done in \f4setregs\f1 in \f3os/machdep.c\f1. 
.P
Processors that do not support protection violations in kernel mode will
have to \f2as_fault\f1 the page which contains data and \f2bss\f1 before zeroing out 
the \f2bss\f1 portion (\f4execmap - zfoddiff\f1 calculations).
.P 
In \f3sys/exec.h\f1 the define \f4getexmag\f1 should be modified to reflect
the byte ordering of the machine and
the define \f4execpoststack\f1 should be modified to reflect 
stack growth directions.
The 3B2 grows the stack from low memory to high.

The \f4elf_M32.h\f1 header file is specific to the 3B2.
Each architecture should have an \f4elf_ARCH.h\f1 header file.
The maximum page size and the constant representing the presence of a floating
point unit should be changed appropriately.
In the \f4elfcore\f1 routine the presence of machine specific 
boards may need to be flagged in the core file.

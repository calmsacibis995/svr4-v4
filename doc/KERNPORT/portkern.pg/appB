.CH "Appendix B: Porting Tips" B
If these \f2Porting Notes\f1 are updated for future UNIX System V releases,
we hope to include in this appendix miscellaneous porting tips and items that a
porter should know about.
.H 2 "Backup Configuration"
There are machine-specific data files that are used by
system administration and maintenance utilities.
While these files are often administered for each
specific installation, it is generally appropriate to
deliver these files with information that
conforms to the default configuration of a particular
machine model.
.P
As an example, more sophisticated sites may tailor the allocation of
file systems such as \f3/usr\f1 to disk drives and partitions.
Less sophisticated owners of smaller systems may accept the default
disk file partitioning on a particular integrated model of a computer
system. 
In these cases, it is useful to have the defaults work correctly
in device management and backup/restore services.
.P
For each model or "standard" configuration
that is offered, the \f2device management file\f1 should contain
complete descriptions of the standard or integrated devices configured
for use by administrative utilities (e.g., backup/restore,
software package installation, system administration interface).
.P
Another file that should be checked is the \f2backup register table\f1.
For example, this table might contain a default for full file system
backups of the \f3/home\f1 file system in demand mode for a small system.
For large systems, it might contain a full file system backup in demand
mode for Sundays and daily incremental file system backups in demand mode
for other days of the week.
.P
The
.BT "System Administrator's Guide"
should be consulted for the 
specifics on how to access and change these files.

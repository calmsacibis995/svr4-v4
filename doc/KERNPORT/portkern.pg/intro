.CH "Introduction" 1
.H 1 "Introduction"
.H 2 "General Information"
These \f2Porting Notes\f1 provide an additional help to porters and go along
with UNIX\(rg System V Release 4.0 source product.
They describe things a porter should be aware of, different
approaches to porting UNIX, and identify areas requiring a porter's
attention.
It is hoped that these notes reduce a need to read a source code extensively.
.P
These notes assume that a porter is an experienced systems person and knows how
to port UNIX from source tapes.
It is also assumed that a porter is familiar with UNIX System V Release 3.0.
.P
The attempt is to describe relevant source files in directories that
have important changes porters should know about and to describe
actions that a porter must take.
Some changes are machine dependent, and for obvious reasons no definite action
can always be given.
However, a general idea of an expected change may be provided.
Note that not all directories or files are covered here.
Also note that these notes describe Release 4.0 porting to AT&T 3B2 and any
add-ons (for example, MERGE/386, VPIX/ix, etc.), other porting bases, or driver 
specific items beyond the "pure" Release 4.0 are not within the scope of this text.
.P
The known or suspected dependencies are identified as follows:
.DS
.nf
	MD  - Machine Dependent
	CD  - Compiler Dependent
	OD  - Object File Dependent
	DD  - Driver Dependent
	NCR - No Change Required (we're not aware of any required changes)

.H 3 "Kernel Source"
.IX kernel source location
The kernel source files are located in \f3/usr/src/uts/3b2\f1.
The following describes briefly these source files:
.BL
.LI
The \f3boot\f1 directory contains boot and machine dependent code.
.LI
The \f3debug\f1 directory has kernel debugging code.
.LI
The \f3fs\f1 directory contains file system independent code.
It has several subdirectories:
.BL
.LI
The \f3fs/fd\f1 directory has code for the \f3dev/fd\f1 file system.
.LI
The \f3fs/proc\f1 directory has code for the \f3proc\f1 file system.
.LI
The \f3fs/s5\f1 directory has code for the S5 file system.
Notes about S5 directory format:
.br
.sp
1. \f4inode\f1 numbers have been increased to an unsigned long in this release
as part of Expanded Fundamental Types (EFT),
.br
.sp
2. The file name component \f2d_name\f1 is not guaranteed to be NULL terminated.
.LI
The \f3fs/specfs\f1 directory has code for the \f3specfs\f1 file system.
The code handles block and character special files including STREAMS and is used by
S5, UFS, and other file system types that support special files.
.LI
The \f3fs/bfs\f1 directory has the boot file system.
.LI
The \f3fs/nfs\f1 directory has the Network File System (NFS). 
.LI
The \f3fs/fifofs\f1 directory has the FIFO file system that supports pipes and FIFOs.
.LI
The \f3fs/rfs\f1 directory has Remote File Sharing (RFS).
.LI
The \f3fs/namefs\f1 directory has the NAME file system that supports mounting
resources on arbitrary file names.
It is used mainly for mounted Streams (also called named Streams).
.LI
The \f3fs/ufs\f1 directory has the UFS  file system that is basically BSD file
system.
.LI
The \f3fs/xnamfs\f1 directory has the XENIX compatibility file system.
.LE
.LI
The \f3io\f1 directory has all I/O hardware and software drivers and STREAMS
modules and drivers along with some generic code.
.LI
The \f3master.d\f1 directory contains master files for system configuration.
.LI
The \f3ml\f1 directory has kernel assembly language code.
.LI
The \f3os\f1 directory has operating system code.
.LI
The \f3sys\f1 directory has system header files.
The \f3sys/fs\f1 directory has header files for specific file system types.
.LI
The \f3disp\f1 directory has code for the system dispatcher (process scheduler).
.LI
The \f3des\f1 directory has code for the data encryption algorithm that is
used for secure Remote Procedure Call (RPC).
.LI
The \f3vm\f1 directory contains code for the memory manager (virtual memory).
.LI
The \f3exec\f1 directory contains code for COFF object files (\f3exec/coff\f1) and
ELF object files (\f3exec/elf\f1).
\f3exec\f1 also contains the directory \f3intp\f1 that has code for '#!' handling.
.LI
The \f3ktli\f1 directory has kernel Transport Level Interface routines used by NFS.
.LI
The \f3netinet\f1 directory has the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
(DARPA) networking code.
.LI
The \f3net\f1 directory contains the header files for DARPA.
.LI
The \f3nfs\f1 directory has header files for NFS.
.LI
The \f3klm\f1 directory has code for the kernel portion of NFS lock manager.
.LI
The \f3rpc\f1 directory has code for RPC functions used by NFS and other
networking features such as the lock manager.
.LE
.H 2 "Conventions Used"
The document is presented for the most part in the list format.
Lists are also indented to show which functions are included in the program
(\f3.c\f1 files).
Each directory is a chapter by itself.
.P
Appendix A describes some data structures and their usage, and also has miscellaneous
information that may interest Release 4.0 porters.
.P
The following conventions are used in this document:
.BL
.LI
Directory and path names are given \f3bold\f1.
Program names in the directory are also in \f3bold\f1.
.LI
Function names, data structure names, and values (for example, defaults)
of the variables in the programs are given in \f4constant width\f1.
Short C-language and assembly language instructions and register names (for example,
\f4r0\f1) are also in \f4constant width\f1.
.LI
Variables names are in \f2italics\f1.
.LE
.SS
Screens are used to show program code and data structure format.
.SE
.H 2 "Other Documentation"
The following documents may also interest porters:
.BL
.LI
.BT "Programmer's Guide: STREAMS"
and
.BT "Device Driver Interface/Driver-Kernel Interface (DDI/DKI) Reference Manual"
which are related to systems programming.
.LI
Other porting documents are:
.BT "Programmer's Guide: Porting the X11/NeWS\(rg Server"
and
.BT "Programmer's Guide: Porting the XWIN Server."
.LE
Several programmer's guides and other release specific information are also
available.

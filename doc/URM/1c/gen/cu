.SH NAME
\f4cu\f1 \- call another \s-1UNIX\s+1 system
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4cu\f1
[ options ]
[ destination ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4cu\fP
calls up another \s-1UNIX\s+1 system,
a terminal,
or possibly a non-\s-1UNIX\s+1 system.
It manages an interactive conversation with possible
transfers of files.
It is convenient to think of \f4cu\fP as operating in two phases.
The first phase is the connection phase in which the connection is
established.
\f4cu\fP then enters the conversation phase.
The
\f4\-d\f1
option is the only one that applies to both phases.
.TP 12
\f4\-d\f1
Causes diagnostic traces to be printed.
.SS "Connection Phase"
\f4cu\fP uses the same mechanism that
\f4uucp\fP
does to establish a connection.  This means that it will use the
\f4uucp\fP
control files
\f4/etc/uucp/Devices\f1 and \f4/etc/uucp/Systems\f1.
This gives \f4cu\fP the ability to choose from several different media
to establish the connection.
The possible media include telephone lines, direct connections,
and
local area networks (LAN).
The
\f4Devices\f1
file contains a list of media that are available on your system.
The
\f4Systems\f1
file contains information for connecting to remote systems, but it is
not generally readable.
.P
The
.I destination
parameter from the command line is used to tell \f4cu\fP what system you
wish to connect to.  \f2destination\f1 can be blank, a telephone number, a
system name, or a LAN specific address.
A telephone number is a string consisting of the tone dial
characters (the digits 0 through 9, \f(CW*\f1, and \f(CW#\f1) plus
the special characters \f(CW=\f1 and \-.
The equal sign designates a secondary dial tone and the minus sign
creates a 4 second delay.
A system name is the name of any computer that
\f4uucp\fP
can call; the
\f4uuname\fP
command prints a list of these names.
The documentation for your LAN will show the form of the LAN specific
address.
.P
If \f4cu\fP's default behavior is invoked (not using the
\f4\-c\f1 or \f4\-l\f1
options), \f4cu\fP will use
.IR destination
to determine which medium to use.
If
.I destination
is a telephone number, \f4cu\fP will assume that you wish to use a telephone
line and it will select an automatic call unit (ACU).
If the
.I destination
is not a telephone number, then \f4cu\fP will assume that it is a system
name.
\f4cu\fP will follow the
\f4uucp\fP
calling mechanism and use the
\f4Systems\f1 and \f4Devices\f1
files to obtain the best available connection.
Since \f4cu\fP will choose a speed that is appropriate for
the medium that it selects, you may not use the
\f4\-s\f1
option when
.I destination
is a system name.
.P
The
\f4\-c\f1 and \f4\-l\f1
options modify this default behavior.
\f4\-c\f1
is most often used to select a LAN by specifying a Type field from the
\f4Devices\f1
file.
Here,
.I destination
is assumed to be a system name.  If the connection attempt to system name
fails, a connection will be attempted using \f2destination\f1 as a LAN
specific address.
The
\f4\-l\f1
option is used to specify a device associated with a direct connection.
If the connection is truly a direct connection to the remote machine,
then there is no need to specify a
.IR destination .
This is the only case where a blank
.I destination
is allowed.
On the other hand, there may be cases in which the specified device
connects to a dialer, so it is valid to specify a telephone number as
a
.IR destination .
The
\f4\-c\f1 and \f4\-l\f1
options should not be specified on the same command line.
.P
\f4cu\fP
accepts many options.
The
\f4\-c\f1, \f4\-l\f1, and \f4\-s\f1
options play a part in selecting the medium;
the remaining options are used in configuring the line.
.TP 12
\&\f4\-s\f1\f2speed\f1
Specifies the transmission speed (300, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600).
The default value is "Any" speed which will depend on the order of the
lines in the \f4/etc/uucp/Devices\f1 file.
Most modems are either 300, 1200, or 2400
baud.
Directly connected lines may be set to a speed higher than 2400 baud.
.TP
\f4\-c\f2type\f1
The first field in the \f4Devices\f1 file is the "Type" field.  The \f4\-c\f1
option forces \f4cu\fP to only use entries in the "Type" field that match the
user specified \f2type\f1.
The specified \f2type\f1 is usually the name of a local area network.
.TP
\&\f4\-l\f1\f4line\fP
Specifies a device name to use as the communication line.
This can be 
used to override the search that would otherwise take place
for the first available line having the right
speed.
When the \f4\-l\f1 option is used without the \f4\-s\f1 option, the speed
of a line is taken from the 
Devices file record in which
\f4line\fP
matches the second field (the Line field).
When the \f4\-l\f1 and \f4\-s\f1 options are both used together,
\f4cu\fP will search the Devices file to check if the requested speed for the
requested line is available.
If so, the connection will be made at the
requested speed, otherwise, an error message will be printed and the call
will not be made. 
In the general case where a specified device is a directly connected
asynchronous line
(e.g., \f4/dev/term/\f2ab\f1), a telephone number 
(\f2telno\f1) is not required.
The specified device need not be in the \f4/dev\f1 directory.
If the specified device
is associated with an auto dialer, a telephone number must be 
provided. 
If
.I destination
is used with this option, it must be a telephone number.
.TP
\&\f4\-b\f2n\f1
Forces \f2n\f1 to be the number of bits processed on the line.
\f2n\f1 is either 7 or 8.  This allows connection between
systems with different character sizes.  By default, the
character size of the line is set to the same as the current
local terminal.
.TP
\f4\-e\f1
Set an EVEN data parity.  This option designates that EVEN parity is
to be generated for data sent to the remote system.
.TP
\f4\-h\f1
Set communication mode to half-duplex.  This option emulates the local
\f4echo\fP(1) command in order to support calls to other computer systems
that expect terminals to be set to half-duplex mode.
.TP
\f4\-n\f1
Request user prompt for telephone number.  For added security, this option
will prompt the user to provide the telephone number to be dialed, rather than 
taking it from the command line. 
.TP
\f4\-o\f1
Set an ODD data parity.  This option designates that ODD parity is to be
generated for data sent to the remote system.
.TP
\f4\-t\f1
Used to dial a terminal which has been set to auto answer.
Appropriate mapping of carriage-return to carriage-return-line-feed
pairs is set.
.P
.SS "Conversation Phase"
After making the connection,
\f4cu\fP
runs as two processes:
the
.I transmit\^
process reads data from the standard input and,
except for lines beginning with
\f(CW~\f1,
passes it to the remote system;
the
.I receive\^
process accepts data from the remote system and,
except for lines beginning with
\f(CW~\f1,
passes it to the standard output.
Normally, an automatic \s-1DC\s+1\&3/\s-1DC\s+1\&1 protocol
is used to control input from the remote so the buffer is
not overrun.
Lines beginning with \f(CW~\f1 have special meanings.
.PP
The
.I transmit\^
process interprets the following user initiated commands:
.TP 20
\f(CW~\f1\s+4.\s-4
terminate the conversation.
.TP
\f(CW~\f4!\f1
escape to an interactive shell on the local system.
.TP
\f(CW~\f4!\f2cmd\|.\|.\|.\f1
run
.I cmd\^
on the local system
(via
\f4sh \-c\f1).
.TP
\f(CW~\f4$\f2cmd\|.\|.\|.\f1
run
.I cmd\^
locally and send its output
to the remote system.
.TP
\f(CW~\f4%cd\f1
change the directory on the local system.
Note:
\f(CW~\f4!cd\f1
will cause the command to be run by a sub-shell,
probably not what was intended.
.TP
\&\f(CW~\f4%take\f1 \|\f2from\fP \|[ \|\f2to\fP \|]
copy file
.I from\^
(on the remote system)
to file
.I to\^
on the local system.
If
.I to\^
is omitted,
the
.I from\^
argument is used in both places.
.TP
\&\f(CW~\f4%put\fP \|\f2from\fP \|[ \|\f2to\fP \|]
copy file
.I from\^
(on local system)
to file
.I to\^
on remote system.
If
.I to\^
is omitted, the
.I from\^
argument is used in both places.
.TP
\&\f(CW~~\f1 \|\f4line\fP
send the line
\f(CW~\f1
\f4line\fP
to the remote system.
.TP
\&\f(CW~\f4%break\fP
transmit a 
\f4BREAK\f1
to the remote system (which can also be specified as \f(CW~\f4%b\f1).
.TP
\f(CW~\f4%debug\f1
toggles the
\f4\-d\f1
debugging option on or off (which can also be specified as \f(CW~\f4%d\f1).
.TP
\f(CW~\f4t\f1
prints the values of the termio structure variables for the user's
terminal (useful for debugging).
.TP
\f(CW~\f4l\f1
prints the values of the termio structure variables for the remote
communication line (useful for debugging).
.TP
\f(CW~\f4%ifc\f1
toggles between \s-1DC\s+1\&3/\s-1DC\s+1\&1
input control protocol and no input control.
This is useful when the remote system does
not respond properly to the \s-1DC\s+1\&3 and \s-1DC\s+1\&1 characters.
(can also be specified as \f4\(ap%nostop\f1).
.TP
\f(CW~\f4%ofc\f1
toggles the output flow control setting.  When
enabled, outgoing data may be flow controlled
by the remote host (can also be specified
as \f4\(ap%noostop\f1).
.TP
\f(CW~\f4%divert\f1
allow/disallow unsolicited diversions.  That is,
diversions not specified by \f(CW~\f4%take\f1.
.TP
\f(CW~\f4%old\f1
allow/disallow old style syntax for received diversions.
.PP
The
.I receive\^
process normally copies data from the remote system to the standard
output of the local system.  It may also direct the output to local
files.
.PP
The use of
\f(CW~\f4%put\f1
requires
\f4stty\fP(1)
and
\f4cat\fP(1)
on the remote side.
It also requires that the
current control characters on the remote
system be identical to the current control
characters on the local system.
Backslashes are inserted at appropriate places
for these control characters.
.PP
The use of
\f(CW~\f4%take\f1
requires the existence of
\f4echo\fP(1)
and
\f4cat\fP(1)
on the remote system.
Also,
\f4tabs\fP
mode (See
.I stty(1))
should be set on the remote system if
tabs are to be copied without expansion to spaces.
.PP
When  
\f4cu\fP
is used on system X to connect to system Y and
subsequently used on system Y to connect to
system Z, commands on system Y can be executed
by using \f(CW~~\f1. Executing a tilde command reminds the user 
of the local system \f4uname\fP.
For example, \f4uname\fP can be executed
on Z, X, and Y as follows:
.br
.sp
.RS
uname
.br
Z
.br
\f(CW~\f1[X]!uname
.br
X
.br
\f(CW~~\f1[Y]!uname
.br
Y
.br
.RE
.sp
In general,
\f(CW~\f1
causes the command to be executed on the original machine.
\f(CW~~\f1
causes the command to be executed on the next machine in
the chain.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Exit code is zero for normal exit,
otherwise, one.
.SH NOTES
The \f4cu\fP command
does not do any integrity checking on data it transfers.
Data fields with special
\f4cu\fP
characters may not be transmitted properly.
Depending on the interconnection hardware,
it may be necessary to use a
\f(CW~\f1.
to terminate the conversion, even if
\f4stty 0\f1
has been used.
Non-printing characters are not dependably transmitted using either
the \f(CW~\f4%put\f1 or \f(CW~\f4%take\f1 commands.
\f4cu\fP, between an IMBR1 and a PENRIL modem,
will not return a login prompt immediately upon connection.
A carriage return will return the prompt.
.PP
\f(CW\~\f4%put\f1 and \f(CW\~\f4%take\f1 cannot be used 
over multiple links.  Files must be moved
one link at a time.
.PP
There is an artificial slowing of transmission by
\f4cu\fP
during the
\f(CW~\f4%put\f1
operation so that loss of data is unlikely.  Files transferred using
\f(CW~\f4%take\f1 or \f(CW~\f4%put\f1 must contain a trailing newline, otherwise, the
operation will hang.  Entering a \s-1CTRL\s+1-d command usually clears the
hang condition.

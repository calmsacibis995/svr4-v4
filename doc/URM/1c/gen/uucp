.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS uucp
\f4uucp\fP
copies files named by the
.I source-file\^
arguments to the
.I destination-file\^
argument.
A source file name may be a patname on your machine, or, may
have the form:
.PP
.RS
\f2system-name\f4!\f2pathname\f1
.RE
.PP
where
.I system-name\^
is taken from a list of system names that
\f4uucp\fP
knows about.
The destination
.I system-name\^
may also include a list of system names such as
.PP
.RS
\f2system-name\f4!\f2system-name\f4!...!\f2system-name\f4!\f2pathname\f1
.RE
.PP
In this case, an attempt is made to send the file, via the specified route,
to the destination.
Care should be taken to ensure that intermediate nodes in the
route are willing to forward information
(see \s-1NOTES\s0 below for restrictions).
.PP
The shell metacharacters
\f4?\f1,
\f4\(**\f1
and
\f4[\|.\|.\|.\|]\f1
appearing in
.I pathname\^
will be expanded on the appropriate system.
.PP
Path names may be one of:
.PP
.RS
.TP 5
(1)
a full pathname;
.TP 5
(2)
a pathname preceded by
\f(CW~\f2user\f1
where
.I user\^
is a login name on the specified system
and is replaced by that user's login directory;
.TP 5
(3)
a pathname preceded by
\f(CW~\f1/\f2destination\f1
where
.I destination\^
is appended to
\f4/var/spool/uucppublic\f1;
(NOTE:  This destination will be treated as a file name unless
more than one file is being transferred by this request or
the destination is already a directory.
To ensure that it is a directory, follow the destination with a '/'.
For example \f(CW~\f1/\f2dan\f1/ as the destination will make the directory
/var/spool/uucppublic/dan if it does not exist and put the requested file(s)
in that directory).
.TP 5
(4)
anything else is prefixed by the current directory.
.RE
.PP
If the result is an erroneous pathname for the remote system,
the copy will fail.
If the
.I destination-file\^
is a directory, the last part of the
.I source-file\^
name is used.
.ig
If a simple
.I ~user\^
destination is inaccessible to 
\f4uucp\fP,
data is copied to a spool directory and the user
is notified by
\f4mail\fP(1).
..
.PP
\f4uucp\fP
removes execute permissions across the transmission
and gives 0666 read and write permissions (see
\f4chmod\fP(2)).
.PP
The following options are interpreted by
\f4uucp\fP:
.TP 10
\f4\-c\f1
Do not copy local file to the spool directory for transfer to the remote
machine (default).
.TP
\f4\-C\f1
Force the copy of local files to the spool directory for transfer.
.TP
\f4\-d\f1
Make all necessary directories for the file copy (default).
.TP
\f4\-f\f1
Do not make intermediate directories for the file copy.
.TP
\f4\-g\f2grade\f1
\f2grade\f1 can be either a single letter/number or a string of alphanumeric
characters defining a service grade.
The
\f4uuglist\f1
command can determine whether it is appropriate to use the single letter/number
or a string of alphanumeric characters as a service grade.
The output from the uuglist command will be a list of service grades that
are available or a message that says to use a single letter/number as a 
grade of service.
.TP
\f4\-j\f1
Output the \f4uucp\fP job identification
string on the standard output.
This job identification can be used by
\f4uustat\fP
to obtain the status of a \f4uucp\fP job
or to terminate a \f4uucp\fP job.  It is valid as long as the
job remains queued on the local system.
.TP
\f4\-m\f1
Send mail to the requester when the copy is
completed.
.TP
\f4\-n\f2user\^\f1
Notify
.I user\^
on the remote system that a file was sent.
.TP
\f4\-r\f1
Do not start the file transfer, just queue the job.
.TP
\f4\-s\f2file\^\f1
Report status of the transfer to
.I file.\^
This option overrides the \f4\-m\f1 option.
.TP
\f4\-x\f2debug_level\f1
Produce debugging output on standard output.
\f2debug_level\f1 is a number between 0 and 9;
as it increases to 9, more detailed debugging information is given.
This option may not be available on all systems.
.SS uulog
.PP
\f4uulog\fP
queries a log file
of 
\f4uucp\fP
or
\f4uuxqt\fP
transactions in file
\f4/var/uucp/.Log/uucico/\f4system\fP
or
\f4/var/uucp/.Log/uuxqt/\f2system.\f1
.ne 3
.PP
These options cause 
\f4uulog\fP
to print logging information:
.TP 10
\f4\-s\f2sys\f1
Print information about file transfer work involving system \f2sys\f1.
.TP
\f4\-f\f4system\fP
Does a "\f4tail \-f\f1" of the file transfer log for \f4system\fP.
(You must hit \s-1BREAK\s0 to exit this function.)
.PP
Other options used in conjunction with the above options are:
.TP 10
\f4\-x\f1
Look in the \f4uuxqt\fP log file for the given system.
.TP
\f4\-\f2number\f1
Indicates that a "tail" command of
.I number
lines should be executed.
.SS uuname
.PP
\f4uuname\fP
lists the names of systems known to \f4uucp\fP.
\f4uuname\fP recognizes the following options:
.TP 10
\f4\-c\f1
Returns the names of systems known to \f4cu\fP.
(The two lists are the same, unless your machine is using
different \f2Systems\f1 files for \f4cu\fP and \f4uucp\fP.
See the \f2Sysfiles\f1 file.)
.TP
\f4\-l\f1
Return the local system name.

.SH NOTES
For security reasons, the domain of remotely accessible files may
be severely restricted.
You will very likely not be able to access files by pathname;
ask a responsible person on the remote system to
send them to you.
For the same reasons you will probably not be able
to send files to arbitrary pathnames.
As distributed, the remotely accessible files are
those whose names begin
\f4/var/spool/uucppublic\f1
(equivalent to
\f4~/\f1).
.PP
All files received by
\f4uucp\fP
will be owned by
\f4uucp\fP.
.br
.P
The \f4\-m\fP option will only work sending files or receiving
a single file.
Receiving multiple files specified by special shell
characters \f4? \(** \|[\|.\|.\|.\|]\fP will not activate
the \f4\-m\fP option.
.P
The forwarding of files through other systems may not be compatible
with the previous version of \f4uucp\fP.  If forwarding is used, all
systems in the route must have compatible versions of \f4uucp\fP.
.SH NOTES
Protected files and files that are in protected directories that
are owned by the requester can be sent by
\f4uucp\fP.
However, if the requester is root, and the directory is not searchable
by "other" or the file is not readable by "other", the request will
fail.

.SH NAME
\f4uux\f1 \- \s-1UNIX\s+1-to-\s-1UNIX\s+1 system command execution
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4uux\f1
[
\f2options\f1
]
\f4command-string\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4uux\fP
will gather zero or more files from various systems,
execute a command on a specified system
and then send standard output to a file on a specified
system.
.P
NOTE:  For security reasons, most installations
limit the list of
commands executable on behalf of an incoming request from
\f4uux\fP,
permitting only
the receipt of mail (see
\f4mail\fP(1)).
(Remote execution permissions are defined
in
\f4/etc/uucp/Permissions\f1.)
.PP
The \f2command-string\fP is made up of one or more arguments that look
like a shell command line,
except that the command and file names
may be prefixed by
\f2system-name\f4!\f1.\fP\f1
A null \f2system-name\fP is interpreted as the local system.
.PP
File names may be one of:
.RS
.TP 5
(1)
a full pathname;
.TP 5
(2)
a pathname preceded by
\f(CW~\f2xxx\f1,
where
.I xxx\^
is a login name on the specified system
and is replaced by that user's login directory;
.br
.TP 5
(3)
anything else is prefixed by the current directory.
.RE
.PP
As an example, the command
.IP
\f(CWuux "\^!diff sys1!/home/dan/file1 sys2!/a4/dan/file2 > !~/dan/file.diff\^"\f1
.PP
will get the \f2file1\fP and \f2file2\fP files
from the ``sys1'' and ``sys2'' machines,
execute a
\f4diff\fP(1)
command
and put the results in \f2file.diff\fP in the 
local
\f2PUBDIR\f1/dan/ directory.  \f2PUBDIR\f1 is a public directory defined in
the \f4uucp\fP source.  By default, this directory is
\f4/var/spool/uucppublic\f1
.PP
Any special shell characters such as \f(CW<, >, ;, |\f1 should be quoted either
by quoting the entire \f2command-string\fP, or quoting the special
characters as individual arguments.
.PP
\f4uux\fP
will attempt to get all appropriate files to the specified system where
they will be processed.
For files that are output files, the file name must be escaped using
parentheses.
For example, the command:
.IP
\f(CWuux "a!cut -f1 b!/usr/file > c!/usr/file"\f1
.PP
gets "/usr/file" from system "b" and sends it to system "a",
performs a \f4cut\fP command on that file
and sends the result of the 
\f4cut\fP
command to system "c".
.PP
\f4uux\fP
will notify you if the requested command on the remote
system was disallowed.
This notification can be turned off by the \f4\-n\fP option.
The response comes by remote mail from the remote machine.
.PP
The following \f2options\fP are interpreted by
\f4uux\fP:
.TP 10
\f4\-\f1
The standard input to
\f4uux\fP
is made the standard input to the
.IR command-string .
.TP 10
\f4\-a\f2name\f1
Use
.I name
as the user job identification replacing the initiator user-id.
(Notification will be returned to user-id \f2name\f1.)
.TP 10
\f4\-b\f1
Return whatever standard input was provided to the \f4uux\fP command if the exit status is non-zero.
.TP 10
\f4\-c\f1
Do not copy local file to the spool directory for transfer to the remote
machine (default).
.TP 10
\f4\-C\f1
Force the copy of local files to the spool directory for transfer.
.TP
\f4\-g\f2grade\f1
\f2grade\f1 can be either a single letter, number, or a string of alphanumeric
characters defining a service grade.
The \f2uuglist\f1(1C) command determines whether it is appropriate to
use the single letter, number, or a string of alphanumeric characters
as a service grade.
The output from the \f2uuglist\f1 command will be a list of service grades that
are available or a message that says to use a single letter or number as a 
grade of service.
.TP 10
\f4\-j\f1
Output the jobid string on the standard output which is
the job identification.  This job identification can be used by
\f4uustat\fP(1C)
to obtain the status 
or terminate a job.
.TP 10
\f4\-n\f1
Do not notify the user if the command fails.
.TP 10
\f4\-p\f1
Same as \-:
The standard input to
\f4uux\fP
is made the standard input to the
.IR command-string .
.TP 10
\f4\-r\f1
Do not start the file transfer, just queue the job.
.TP
\f4\-s\f2file\f1
Report status of the transfer in \f2file\f1.
.TP
\f4\-x\f2debug_level\f1
Produce debugging output on the standard output.
\f2debug_level\f1 is a number between 0 and 9; as it increases to 9, more
detailed debugging information is given.
.TP 10
\f4\-z\f1
Send success notification to the user.
.SH FILES
.nf
/var/spool/uucp             spool directories
/etc/uucp/Permissions     remote execution permissions
/usr/lib/uucp/\(**             other programs
/etc/uucp/\(**                   other data and programs
.fi
.SH NOTES
Only the first command of a shell pipeline may
have a
\f2system-name\f4!\f1.\f1
All other commands are executed on the system of the first
command.
.br
The use of the shell metacharacter
\f4\(**\f1
will probably not do what you want it to do.
The shell tokens
\f4<<\f1
and
\f4>>\f1
are not implemented.
.PP
The execution of commands on remote systems takes place in an
execution directory known to the
\f4uucp\fP
system.
All files required for the execution will be put into this
directory unless they already reside on that machine.
Therefore, the\p
.br
.ne 1i
simple file name (without path or machine
reference) must be unique within the
\f4uux\fP
request.
The following command will NOT work:
.PP
.RS
.nf
uux "a!diff b!/home/dan/xyz c!/home/dan/xyz > !xyz.diff"
.fi
.RE
.br
.ne 6
.PP
but the command
.PP
.RS
.nf
uux "a!diff a!/home/dan/xyz c!/home/dan/xyz > !xyz.diff"
.fi
.RE
.PP
will work.
(If
\f4diff\fP
is a permitted command.)
.PP
Protected files and files that are in protected directories that are owned
by the requester can be sent in commands using
\f4uux\fP.
However, if the requester is root, and the directory is not searchable
by "other", the request will fail.

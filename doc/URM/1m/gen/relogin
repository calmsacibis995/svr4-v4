.SH NAME
\f4relogin\f1 \- rename login entry to show current layer
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4 /usr/lib/layersys/relogin\f1
\f1[\f4\-s\f1]
[\f2line\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\f4relogin\fP
command
changes the terminal \f2line\fP field of a user's
\f4utmp\fP
entry to the name of the windowing terminal layer
attached to standard input.
\f4write\fP
messages sent to this user are directed to this layer.
In addition,
the
\f4who\f1
command will show the user associated with this layer.
\f4relogin\fP
may only be invoked under
\f4layers\fP.
.PP
\f4relogin\fP
is invoked automatically by
\f4layers\fP
to set the
\f4utmp\fP
entry to the terminal line of the first layer created upon startup,
and to reset the
\f4utmp\fP
entry to the real line on termination.
It may be invoked by a user to designate a different layer
to receive
\f4write\fP
messages.
.sp .5
.TP 8
\f4\-s\f1
Suppress error messages.
.TP
\f2line\fP
Specifies which
\f4utmp\fP
entry to change.
The
\f4utmp\fP
file is searched for an entry with the specified
\f2line\fP
field.
That field is changed to the line associated with the standard input.
(To learn what lines are associated with a given user, say jdoe,
type \f4ps -f -u jdoe\f1 and note the values shown in the
\f4TTY\f1
field [see \f4ps\fP(1)]).

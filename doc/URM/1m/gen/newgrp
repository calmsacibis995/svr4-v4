.SH NAME
\f4newgrp\f1 \- log in to a new group
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4newgrp\f1
\f1[\f4\|\-\|\f1]
[ group ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4newgrp\fP
changes a user's real and effective group ID.
The user remains logged in
and the current directory is unchanged.  
The user is always given a new shell, replacing the current shell,
by \f4newgrp\fP,
regardless of whether it terminated successfully or
due to an error condition (i.e.,
unknown group).
.PP
Exported variables retain their values after invoking
\f4newgrp\fP;
however, all unexported variables are either reset to their
default value or set to null.
System variables (such as \f4PS1\fP, \f4PS2\fP,
\f4PATH\fP, \f4MAIL\fP, and \f4HOME)\fP,
unless exported by the system
or explicitly exported by
the user, are reset to default values.
For example, a user has a primary prompt string (\f4PS1\fP) other
than \f4$\fP (default) and has not exported \f4PS1\fP.
After an invocation of \f4newgrp\fP, successful or not,
the user's \f4PS1\fP will now be set to the default prompt string \f4$\fP.
Note that the shell command
\f4export\fP
[see the \f4sh\fP(1) manual page]
is the method to export variables so
that they retain their assigned value when invoking new shells.
.PP
With no arguments,
\f4newgrp\fP
changes the user's group IDs (real and effective) back to
the group specified in the user's password file entry.
This is a way to exit the effect of
an earlier
\f4newgrp\fP
command.
.PP
If the first argument to
\f4newgrp\fP
is a
\f4\-\f1,
the environment is changed to what would be expected if the
user actually logged in again as a member of the new group.
.PP
A password is demanded if the group has a password and the user is not listed
in
\f4/etc/group\f1
as being
a member of that group.
.SH FILES
.TP 1i
\f4/etc/group\fP
system's group file
.TP
\f4/etc/passwd\fP
system's password file
.SH NOTES
The ability of the user to enter a password when using this command
will be removed in a future release.

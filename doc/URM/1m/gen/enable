.SH NAME
\f4enable\f1, \f4disable\f1 \- enable/disable \s-1LP\s+1 printers
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4enable \f2printers\f1
.br
\f4disable\f1 [\f2options\f1] \f2printers\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4enable\fP command activates the named
.IR printers ,
enabling them to print requests submitted by
the \f4lp\fP command.
If the printer is remote,
the command will only enable the transfer of requests
to the remote system;
the \f4enable\f1 command must be run again, 
on the remote system,
to activate the printer.
(Run \f4lpstat \-p\fP to get the status of printers.)
.PP
The \f4disable\fP command 
deactivates the named
.IR printers ,
disabling them from printing requests
submitted by \f4lp\fP.
By default, any requests
that are currently printing
on the designated printers
will be reprinted in their entirety
either on the same printer
or on another member of the same class of printers.
If the printer is remote,
this command will only stop 
the transmission of jobs to
the remote system.
The \f4disable\f1 command
must be run on the remote system to disable the printer.
(Run \f4lpstat \-p\fP to get the status of printers.)
Options for use with \f4disable\fP are:
.TP "\w'\-r\|reason\|\ \ \ \ 'u"
\f4\-c\f1
Cancel any requests
that are currently printing
on any of the designated printers.
This option cannot be used with the \f4\-W\f1
option.
If the printer is remote,
the \f4\-c\f1 option will be silently ignored.
.TP
\f4\-r \f2reason\f1
Assign a
.I reason
for the disabling
of the printers.
This \f2reason\f1 applies to all \f2printers\fP specified.
This 
.I reason
is reported by \f4lpstat \-p\fP.
\f2reason\fP must be enclosed in quotes if it contains blanks.
The default reason is \f4unknown reason\fP for existing
printers,
and \f4new printer\fP for printers just added to the system but
not yet enabled.
.TP
\f4\-W\f1
Wait until the request currently being printed
is finished before disabling
the specified printer.
.SP
This option cannot be used with the \f4\-c\f1 option.
If the printer is remote,
the \f4\-W\f1 option will be silently ignored.

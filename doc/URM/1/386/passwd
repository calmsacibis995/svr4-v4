.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4passwd\fP command changes the password or lists password attributes
associated with the user's login
.IR name. 
Additionally, privileged-users may use \f4passwd\fP to install or change
passwords and attributes associated with any login
.IR name.
.P
When used to change a password,
\f4passwd\fP
prompts ordinary users for their old password, if any.
It then prompts for the new password twice.  
When the old password is entered,
\f4passwd\fP
checks to see if it
has aged sufficiently.  
If aging is insufficient, \f4passwd\fP terminates; see \f4shadow\fP(4).
.PP
If the user's password aging has not been turned on, then password
aging is turned on for the user using the \f4MAXWEEKS\fP and 
\f4MINWEEKS\fP parameters in \f4/etc/default/passwd.\f1  If
password aging is turned on the password aging information in
\f4/etc/shadow\f1 remains unmodified.
.PP
Assuming aging is sufficient, a check is made to ensure 
that the new password meets construction requirements.  When the
new password is entered a second time, the two copies of the new 
password are compared.
If the two copies are not identical the cycle of prompting for the 
new password is repeated for at most two more times.
.P
Passwords must be constructed to meet the following requirements:
.P
.RS
Each password must have at least 
\f4PASSLENGTH\fP 
characters as
set in \f4/etc/default/passwd.\f1  
\f4PASSLENGTH\fP 
must contain
a minimum of six characters, but only the first eight characters 
are significant.
.P
Each password must contain at least two alphabetic
characters and at least one numeric or special character.
In this case, alphabetic refers to all upper or lower
case letters.
.P
Each password must differ from the user's login 
.IR name
and any reverse
or circular shift of that login
.IR name .
For comparison purposes, an upper case letter and its corresponding lower 
case letter are equivalent.
.P
New passwords must differ from the old by at least three characters.
For comparison purposes, an upper case letter and its corresponding lower 
case letter are equivalent.
.RE
.P
Privileged users (for example, real and effective \f4uid\fP equal to zero, see
\f4id\fP(1M)
and 
\f4su\fP(1M)
may change any password; hence, 
\f4passwd\fP
does not prompt privileged users for the old password.
Privileged users are not forced to comply with password aging and password  
construction requirements.
A privileged-user can create a null password by entering a carriage return in 
response to the prompt for a new password.
(This differs from \f4passwd \-d\f1 because the \f4password\fP
prompt will still be displayed.)
.P
Any user may use the \f4\-s\f1 option to show password attributes for his
or her own login
.IR name.
.P
The format of the display will be:
.P
.RS
\f2name\f1 \f2status mm/dd/yy \f2min\f1 \f2max\f1 \f2warn\f1 
.RE
.P
or, if password aging information is not present,
.P
.RS
\f2name\f1 \f2status\f1 
.RE
.P
where
.P
.TP 12
\f2name\f1
The login ID of the user.
.TP
\f2status\f1
The password status
of \f2name\f1: \f4PS\fP stands for passworded or locked, \f4LK\fP stands for locked,
and \f4NP\fP stands for no password.
.TP
\f2mm/dd/yy\f1
The date password 
was last changed for \f2name\f1.
(Note that all password aging dates are determined using Greenwich Mean Time
and, therefore, may differ by as much as a day in other time zones.)
.TP
\f2min\f1
The minimum number
of days required between password changes for \f2name\f1.  
\f4MINWEEKS\fP
is found in \f4/etc/default/passwd\fP and is set to 0.
.TP
\f2max\f1 
The maximum number of days the password is valid for \f2name\f1. 
\f4MAXWEEKS\fP
is found in \f4/etc/default/passwd\fP and is set to 0
.TP
\f2warn\f1
The number of days relative to \f2max\f1 before the password expires that 
the \f2name\f1 will be warned.
.P
Only a privileged user can use the following options:
.TP 10
\f4\-l\f1
Lock password entry for \f2name\f1.
.TP
\f4\-d\f1
Delete password for \f2name\f1.
The login \f2name\f1 will not be prompted for password.
.TP
\f4\-n\f1
Set minimum field for \f2name\f1.
The \f2min\f1
field contains the minimum number of days between password
changes for \f2name\f1.
If \f2min\f1 is greater than \f2max\f1, the user may not
change the password.
Always use this option with the \f4\-x\f1 option,
unless \f2max\f1 is set to \-1 (aging turned off).
In that case, \f2min\f1 need not be set.
.TP
\f4\-x\f1
Set maximum field for \f2name\f1.
The \f2max\f1
field contains the number of days that the password
is valid for \f2name\f1.
The aging
for \f2name\f1
will be turned off immediately if \f2max\f1 is set to \-1.
(Aging will be turned on again if the password is changed.)
If it is set to 0, then aging is turned off.
.TP
\f4\-w\f1
Set warn field for \f2name\f1.
The \f2warn\f1 field contains the number of days
before the password expires that the user will be warned.
.TP
\f4\-a\f1
Show password attributes for all entries.
Use
only with \f4\-s\f1 option;
\f2name\f1 must not be provided.
.TP
\f4\-f\f1
Force the user to change password at the
next login by expiring the password for \f2name\f1.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The
\f4passwd\f1
command exits with one of the following values:
.IP 0 10
SUCCESS.
.IP 1 10
Permission denied.
.IP 2 10
Invalid combination of options. 
.IP 3 10
Unexpected failure.  Password file unchanged.
.IP 4 10
Unexpected failure.  Password file(s) missing.
.IP 5 10
Password file(s) busy.  Try again later.
.IP 6 10
Invalid argument to option.
.SH WARNING
If root deletes a password for a user with the \f4passwd -d\f1 
command and password aging is in effect for that user,
the user will not be allowed to add a new password until
the null password has been aged.
This is true even if the
\f4PASSREQ\fP
flag in \f4/etc/default/login\f1 is set to \f4YES\fP.
This results in a user without a password.  It is 
recommended that the \f4-f\f1 option be used whenever the \f4-d\f1
(delete) option is used.  This will force a user to change the 
password at the next login.
.P
If a user is to be set up without a password,
the password entry of the user must be absent from the \f4/etc/shadow\f1 file.
(When a user has no password, \f4passwd -s\f2 user\f1
should return \f4NP\fP.)

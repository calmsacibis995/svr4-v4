\f4setcolour\f1 [\f4-nbrgopc\f1] \f2argument\f1 [\f2argument\f1]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\f4setcolor\f1 and \f4setcolour\f1 allow the user to set the screen to a specific
color.
Both foreground and background colors can be set
independently in a range of 16 colors.  
\f4setcolor\fP can also set the reverse video and graphics character colors.
\f4setcolor\f1 with no arguments produces a usage message that
displays all available colors, then resets the screen to its
previous state.
.P
For example, the following strings are possible colors:
.TS
center,tab(%);
lf4w(.5i) lf4w(.5i) lf4w(.5i) lf4w(.5i).
blue%magenta%brown%black
lt_blue%lt_magenta%yellow%gray
cyan%white%green%red
lt_cyan%hi_white%lt_green%lt_red
.TE
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are available for \f4setcolor\fP and \f4setcolour\fP.
In the arguments below,
\f2color\fP is taken from the above list.
.TP 15
\f4-n\f1
Sets the screen to normal white characters on black background.
.TP
\f2color \f1[\f2color\f1]
Sets the foreground to the first color.
Sets background to second color if a second color choice is specified.
.TP
\f4-b\f2 color\f1
Sets the background to the specified color.
.TP
\f4\-r\f2 color color\f1
Set the foreground reverse video characters to the first color.
Set reverse video characters' background to second color.
.TP
\f4\-g\f2 color color\f1
Set the foreground graphics characters to the first color. Set
graphics characters' background to second color.
.TP
\f4-o\f2 color\f1
Sets the color of the screen border (over scan region).
To reset border color, use \f4\-o black\f1.
.TP
\f4\-p\f2 pitch duration\f1
Set the pitch and duration of the bell.
Pitch is the period in microseconds, and duration is measured
in fifths of a second.
When using this option, a control-G (bell) must be echoed to
the screen for the command to work.  For example:
.sp .5
.nf
.ft 4
	setcolor -p 2500 2
	echo ^G
.ft 1
.fi
.TP
\f4\-c\f2first last\f1
Set the first and last scan lines of the cursor.
.SH NOTES
The ability of \f4setcolor\f1 to set any of these described
functions is ultimately dependent on the ability of devices to
support them.
For example, the \f4-o\f1 option does not work
on the Color Graphics Adapter (CGA).
.P
\f4setcolor\f1 emits an escape sequence that
may or may not have an effect on monochrome devices.
.P
Occasionally changing the screen color can help prolong the life of
your monitor.

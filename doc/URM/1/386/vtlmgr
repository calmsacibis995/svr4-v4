.SH NAME
\f4vtlmgr\f1 \- monitors and opens virtual terminals.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4vtlmgr\f1 [\|\f4-k\f1\|]
.SH DESCRIPTION
When you invoke the \f4vtlmgr\f1 command
(usually from within your \f4.profile\f1),
it places itself in the background and monitors \f4/dev/vtmon\f1 for
signals from the keyboard/display driver to open new virtual terminals.
.P
Option:
.TP
\f4-k\f1
The \f4-k\f1 option sends a \f4SIGHUP\f1 signal to all open 
virtual terminals when you log off (by entering
CTRL-d from your home virtual terminal).
This automatically closes, if possible, existing virtual terminals.
For virtual terminals that cannot be automatically closed, you
are asked if you want to close them manually.
.P
After running \f4vtlmgr\f1,
you open new virtual terminals and then switch between them by entering
a hot-key sequence, specifically:
.P
.RS
\f4ALT - SYS-REQ\f1  \f2key\f1
.RE
.P
where \f2key\f1 is either a function key whose number
corresponds to the number of the virtual terminal
to switch to,
for example, pressing F1 switches you to /dev/vt01 (virtual terminal 01),
pressing F2 switches you to /dev/vt02 (virtual terminal 02), and so forth,
or one of the letters in the following table:
.in 5
.TS
box;
cf2 l
cf4 l.
key	Interpretation
_
h	home virtual terminal (/dev/vt00)
n	next virtual terminal
p	previous virtual terminal
f	force a switch to a virtual terminal
.TE
.in 0
.P
Use the \f4f\f1 key only when the current virtual terminal is
essentially locked up or stuck in graphics mode.  
This will cause the virtual terminal to be reset
to a sane text state and all processes
associated with the virtual terminal will be killed.
.P
When the hot-key sequence is entered, the executable program
pointed to by the \f4$SHELL\f1 variable is executed in
the new virtual terminal.
If \f4$SHELL\f1 is NULL or pointing to a program which is not
executable, \f4/bin/sh\f1 is executed.
The newly opened virtual terminal inherits the environment in
effect when the
\f4vtlmgr\f1 command is invoked.
.P
You may perform setup on each new virtual
terminal as it is created by
\f4vtlmgr\f1 through the \f4.vtlrc\f1 file.
This file should be in your home directory.
Its contents are a shell script that will be run by
\f4/bin/sh\f1 before the shell
prompt is displayed.
In this way it is similar to your
\f4.profile\f1 file.
However, you may not set and export
environment variables to the shell for the virtual
terminal because a different
shell runs the \f4.vtlrc\f1 shell script.  
.P
The system administrator can control how many virtual terminals are
available by
setting a parameter in the file \f4/etc/default/workstations\f1.
Virtual terminals 0 - 8 are configured by default and
the default keyboard map makes up to 13 virtual terminals available
(i.e., an additional 4 virtual terminals can readily be defined 
within the default settings).
The default virtual terminals are
the home terminal and one corresponding to each function key.
An application can make two more available to the end-user (by
reprogramming the keyboard map), or can reserve the last two for
programmatic use only, making 15 virtual terminals available in all.
.P
Note that processes that are no longer visible may still be continuing.
Standard output is directed to the current virtual terminal's screen.
For example, you can issue a \f4cat\f1 command on one virtual terminal,
switch to another virtual terminal to start an
application, and then switch to another to do an edit.
The \f4cat\f1 output will be lost
if the virtual terminal scrolls the data off the screen
unless you initially redirect the output to a file.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The \f4vtlmgr\f1 command will fail under the following conditions:
.sp
	If an illegal option is specified.
.br
	If the device cannot be opened.
.br
	If the command is invoked from a remote terminal.
.br
	If \f4/dev/vtmon\f1 cannot be opened.
.br
	If \f4$SHELL\f1 is set and is not executable.
.br
	If \f4$SHELL\f1 is not set and \f4/bin/sh\f1 cannot be invoked.

.SH NAME
\f4ln\f1 \- link files
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4ln\f1
[
\f4\-s\f1

[
\f4\-f\f1

\f4\-n\f1

.I target
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4ln\fP command links \f2filen\f1 to \f2target\f1
by creating a directory entry that refers to \f2target\f1.
By using \f4ln\fP with one or more file names,
the user may create one or more links to \f2target\f1.
.P
The \f4ln\fP command may be used to create both hard links and symbolic links;
by default it creates hard links.
A hard link to a file is indistinguishable from
the original directory entry.
Any changes to a file are effective independent of the
name used to reference the file.
Hard links may not span file systems
and may not refer to directories.
.P
Without the \f4\-s\f1 option, \f4ln\fP is used to create hard links.
\f2filen\f1 is linked to \f2target\f1.
If \f2target\f1 is a directory,
another file named \f2filen\f1
is created in \f2target\f1 and linked to the original \f2filen\f1.
If \f2target\f1 is a file, its contents are overwritten.
.P
If \f4ln\fP determines that the mode of \f2target\f1 forbids writing,
it will print the mode (see \f4chmod\fP(2)),
ask for a response, and read the standard input for one line.
If the line begins with \f4y\f1, the link occurs,
if permissible;
otherwise, the command exits.
.P
There are three options to \f4ln\fP.  If multiple options are specified, the 
one with the highest priority is used and the remainder are ignored.  The 
options, in descending order of priority, are:
.TP
\f4\-s\f1
\f4ln\fP will create a symbolic link.
A symbolic link contains the name of the file to which it is linked.
Symbolic links may span file systems and may refer to directories.
If the linkname exists, then do not overwrite the contents of the file.
A symbolic link's permissions are always set to read, write, and execute
permission for owner, group, and world (\f4777\f1),
.TP 5
\f4\-f\f1
\f4ln\fP will link files without questioning the user,
even if the mode of \f2target\f1 forbids writing.
Note that this is the default if the standard input is not a terminal,
.TP
\f4\-n\f1
If the linkname is an existing file,
do not overwrite the contents of the file.
The
\f4\-f\f1
option overrides this option.
.P
If the \f4\-s\f1 option is used with two arguments,
\f2target\f1 may be an existing directory or a non-existent file.
If \f2target\f1 already exists and is not a directory,
an error is returned.
\f2filen\f1 may be any path name and need not exist.
If it exists, it may be
a file or directory and may reside on a different
file system from \f2target\f1.
If \f2target\f1 is an existing directory,
a file is created in directory \f2target\f1 whose name is
\f2filen\f1 or the last component of \f2filen\f1.
This file is a symbolic link that references \f2filen\f1.
If \f2target\f1 does not exist, a file with
name \f2target\f1 is created
and it is a symbolic link that references \f2filen\f1.
.P
If the \f4\-s\f1 option is used with more than two arguments,
\f2target\f1 must be an existing directory or an error will be returned.
For each \f2filen\f1,
a file is created in \f2target\f1 whose name is \f2filen\f1 or its last
component;
each new \f2filen\f1 is a symbolic link to the original \f2filen\f1.
The \f2files\f1 and \f2target\f1 may reside on different file systems.

.SH NOTES
Doing operations that involve ".." (such as "\f4cd ..\f1") in a
directory that is symbolically linked will reference the
original directory not the target.
.P
The \f4-s\f1 option does not use the current working directory.  In the
command 
.IP
\f4ln -s\f2 path target\f1
.P
\f2path\f1 is taken literally without
being evaluated against the current working directory.

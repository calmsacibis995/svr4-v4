.SH NAME
\f4chown\fP \- change file owner
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4chown\fP [\f4\-R\fP] [\f4\-h\fP]\f2 owner file \f1...
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4chown\fP
changes the owner of the
\f2file\f1s to \f2owner\f1.
The \f2owner\f1 may be either a decimal user
.SM ID
or a login name found in \f4/etc/passwd\fP file.
.PP
If \f4chown\fP
is invoked by other than the super-user, the set-user-ID
bit of the file mode, 04000, is cleared.
.PP
Only the owner of a file (or the super-user) may change the owner of that file.
.P
Valid options to \f4chown\fP are:
.TP
\f4\-R\fP
Recursive.
\f4chown\f1
descends through the directory, and any subdirectories,
setting the ownership
.SM ID
as it proceeds.
When symbolic links are encountered,
they are traversed.
.TP
\f4\-h\fP
If the file is a symbolic link, change the owner
of the symbolic link.
Without this option, the owner of the file referenced
by the symbolic link is changed.
.P
The operating system has a configuration option
{\f4_POSIX_CHOWN_RESTRICTED\fP}, to restrict ownership changes.
When this option is in effect the owner of the file is
prevented from changing the owner \f4ID\fP of the file.  Only the super-user can
arbitrarily change owner \f4ID\fPs whether this option is in effect or not.
.SH FILES
\f4/etc/passwd\fP
.SH "SEE ALSO"
\f4chgrp\fP(1), \f4chmod\fP(1)
.P
\f4chown\fP(2) in the \f2Programmer's Reference Manual\f1
.P
\f4passwd\fP(4) in the \f2System Administrator's Reference Manual\f1.
.SH NOTES
\f4chgrp\f1 does not check group ID if it is in decimal form.
.P
In a Remote File Sharing environment,
you may not have the permissions that the
output of the \f4ls \-l\f1 command leads
you to believe.
For more information see the ``Mapping
Remote Users'' section of the
``RFS sysadm Interface'' chapter of the
\f2Network User's and Administrator's Guide\f1.

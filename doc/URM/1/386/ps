.SH NAME
\f4ps\f1 \- report process status
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4ps\f1
[
.I options
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4ps\fP
prints information about active processes.
Without \f2options\f1,
\f4ps\fP
prints information about processes associated
with the controlling terminal.
The output contains
only the process \s-1ID\s+1,
terminal identifier, cumulative execution time,
and the command name.
Otherwise, the information that is displayed
is controlled by the \f2options\f1.
.PP
Some options accept lists as arguments.
Items in a list can be either separated by commas or else enclosed
in double quotes and separated by commas or spaces.
Values for
\f2proclist\f1 and \f2grplist\f1
must be numeric.
.PP
The \f2options\fP are:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP 12
\f4\-e\f1
Print information about \f4e\f1very process now running.
.TP
\f4\-d\f1
Print information about all processes except session leaders.
.TP
\f4\-a\f1
Print information about \f4a\f1ll processes most frequently requested:
all those except session
leaders and processes not associated with a terminal.
.TP
\f4\-j\f1
Print session ID and process group ID.
.TP
\f4\-f\f1
Generate a \f4f\f1ull listing.
(See below for significance of columns in a full listing.)
.TP
\f4\-l\f1
Generate a \f4l\f1ong listing.
(See below.)
.TP
\f4\-c\f1
Print information in a format that reflects scheduler properties as described in
\f4priocntl\fP(1).
The
\f4\-c\f1
option affects the output of the
\f4\-f\f1
and
\f4\-l\f1
options, as described below.
'\".TP
'\".BI \-c " corefile\^"
'\"Use the file
'\".I corefile\^
'\"in place of
'\".BR /dev/mem .
'\" Ron Gomes says he is removing the -n option (mail sent on 10/7/88).
'\".TP
'\".BI \-n " name\^"
'\"Valid only for users with a real user id of \f2root\f1 or a real
'\"group id of \f2sys\f1.  Takes argument signifying an alternate
'\"system
'\".I name\^
'\"in place of
'\"\f4/stand/unix\fP.
.TP
\f4\-t\f2 termlist\^\f1
List only process data
associated with the terminal given in \f2termlist\f1.
Terminal identifiers may be specified
in one of two forms:  the device's
file name (e.g., \f4tty04\fP) or, if the device's file name starts
with \f4tty\fP, just the digit identifier (e.g., \f404\fP).
.TP
\f4\-p\f2 proclist\^\f1
List only process data
whose process
.SM ID
numbers are given
in \f2proclist\f1.
.TP
\f4\-u\f2 uidlist\^\f1
List only process data
whose user
.SM ID
number or login name is given in
.IR uidlist .
In the listing, the numerical user
.SM ID
will be printed
unless you give the
\f4\-f\f1
option, which prints
the login name.
.TP
\f4\-g\f2 grplist\^\f1
List only process data
whose group leader's \s-1ID\s+1 number(s) appears in \f2grplist\f1.
(A group leader is a process whose process \s-1ID\s+1 number is identical
to its process group \s-1ID\s+1 number.  
.TP
\f4\-s\f2 sesslist\^\f1
List information on all session leaders 
whose IDs appear in \f2sesslist\f1. 
.PD
.PP
Under the
\f4\-f\f1
option,
\f4ps\fP
tries to determine the command name
and arguments given when the process was created
by examining the user block.
Failing this, the command name
is printed, as it would have appeared without the \f4\-f\f1 option,
in square brackets.
.PP
The column headings and the meaning of the columns in a
\f4ps\fP
listing
are given below; the letters
\f4f\f1
and
\f4l\f1
indicate the
option (\f4f\f1ull or \f4l\f1ong, respectively)
that causes the corresponding heading to appear;
\f4all\f1
means that the heading
always appears.
Note that these two options determine
only
what information is provided for a process; they do not
determine which processes will be listed.

.SH NOTES
Things can change while
\f4ps\fP
is running; the snap-shot it gives is true only for a
split-second, and it may not be accurate by the time you see it.
Some data printed for defunct processes is irrelevant.
.PP
If no
\f2termlist\f1, \f2proclist\f1,
\f2uidlist\f1, or \f2grplist\f1
is specified,
\f4ps\fP
checks
\f4stdin\f1, \f4stdout\f1, and \f4stderr\f1
in that order, looking for the controlling terminal
and will attempt to report on processes associated with
the controlling terminal.
In this situation, if \f4stdin\f1, \f4stdout\f1, and \f4stderr\f1
are all redirected,
\f4ps\fP
will not find a controlling terminal, so there will be no report.
.PP
On a heavily loaded system,
\f4ps\fP may report an
\f4lseek\fP
error and exit.
\f4ps\fP may seek to an invalid user area address:
having obtained the address of a process' user area,
\f4ps\fP may not be able to seek to that address before the
process exits and the address becomes invalid.
.PP
\f4ps \-ef\f1 may not report the actual start of a tty login
session, but rather an earlier time, when a getty was last
respawned on the tty line.
'\".PP
'\"If the user specifies the \f4\-n\f1 flag, the real and effective
'\"UID/GID will be set to the real UID/GID of the user invoking
'\"\f4ps\fP.

.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4tar\fP
saves and restores files
on magnetic tape.
Its actions are controlled by
a string of characters containing
one option
(\f4c\fP, \f4r\fP, \f4t\fP, \f4u\fP, or \f4x\fP), and possibly followed by
one or more modifiers
(\f4v\f1, \f4w\f1, \f4f\f1, \f4b\f1, \f4L\fP, \f4k\fP, \f4F\fP,
\f4X\fP, \f4h\fP, \f4i\fP, \f4e\fP, \f4n\fP, \f4A\fP, \f4l\fP,
\f4m\fP, \f4o\fP, \f4p\fP, and \f2#s\f1).
Other arguments to the command are
\f2files\^\fP
(or directory names)
specifying which files are to be dumped or restored.
In all cases, appearance of a directory name refers to
the files and (recursively) subdirectories of that directory.
.PP
The options are as follows:
.PP
.TP 8
\f4-c\fP
Create a new tape; writing begins at the beginning
of the tape, instead of after the last file.
The \f4-c\fP option implies the
\f4-r\fP
option.
.TP
\f4-r\fP
Replace.  The named
\f2files\^\fP
are written
on the end of the tape.
The
\f4-c\fP
and
\f4-u\fP
options imply the \f4-r\fP option.
.TP
\f4-t\fP
Table.  
The names and other information for the specified files are listed each 
time that they occur on the tape.
The listing is similar to the
format produced by the \f4ls -l\f1 command [see \f4ls\fP(1)].
If no
\f2files\^\fP
argument is given,
all the names
on the tape are listed.
.TP
\f4-u\f1
Update.  The named
\f2files\^\fP
are added to the tape if they
are not already there, or have
been modified since last written on that tape.
The \f4-u\fP option implies the
\f4-r\f1 option.
.TP
\f4-x\fP
Extract.  The named
\f2files\^\fP
are extracted from the tape.
If a named file matches a directory whose contents
had been written onto the tape,
this directory is (recursively) extracted.
Use the file or directory's relative path when appropriate,
or \f4tar\fP will not find a match.
The owner, modification time, and mode are restored (if possible).
If no \f2files\^\fP argument is given,
the entire contents of the tape is extracted.
Note that if several files with the same name
are on the tape, the last one overwrites
all earlier ones.
.PP
The modifiers below may be used 
in the order shown in the synopsis.
.PP
.TP 8
\f2#s\fP
This modifier determines the drive on which the tape is mounted
(replace \f2#\fP with the drive number)
and the speed of the drive (replace \f2s\fP with \f4l\fP,
\f4m\fP, or \f4h\fP for low, medium or high).
The modifier tells \f4tar\fP
to use a drive other than the default drive,
or the drive specified with the \f4-f\fP modifier.
The defaults are listed in \f4/etc/default/tar\fP.
.TP
\f4v\fP
Verbose.
Normally, \f4tar\fP does its work silently.
The \f4v\fP (verbose) modifier causes it to
print the name of each file it treats,
preceded by the option.
With the \f4-t\fP option,
\f4v\fP gives more information about the
tape entries than just the name.
.TP
\f4w\fP
What.  This modifier causes \f4tar\fP
to print the action to be taken,
followed by the name of the file,
and then wait for your confirmation.
If a word beginning with \f4y\fP is given,
the action is performed.
Any other input means no.
This is not valid with the
\f4-t\fP option.
.TP
\f4f\fP
File.  This causes
\f4tar\fP
to use the \f2device\fP argument as the
name of the archive instead of the default.
If the name of the file is \f4\-\fP,
\f4tar\fP writes to the standard output or
reads from the standard input,
whichever is appropriate.
Thus, \f4tar\fP can be used as the head or
tail of a pipeline.
\f4tar\fP can also be used to move hierarchies
with the command:
.PP
.RS
.RS
\f4cd \f2fromdir\fP; tar cf - . | (cd \f2todir\fP; tar xf \-)\f1
.RE
.RE
.PP
.TP 8
\f4b\fP
Blocking Factor.  This modifier causes \f4tar\fP
to use the \f2block\fP argument as the
blocking factor for tape records.
The default is 20.
This modifier should not be supplied when
operating on regular archives or block special devices.
It is mandatory however, when reading archives on
raw magnetic tape archives (see \f4f\fP above).
The block size is determined automatically when reading
tapes created on block special devices
(options \f4x\fP and \f4t\fP).
.TP
\f4l\fP
Link.  This modifier causes \f4tar\fP
to complain if it cannot resolve all of the links
to the files being dumped.
If the \f4l\fP modifier is not specified,
no error messages are printed.
.TP
\f4m\fP
Modify.  This modifier causes \f4tar\fP
to not restore the modification times.
The modification time 
of the file will be the time of extraction.
.TP
\f4o\fP
Ownership.  This modifier causes extracted files to take on the
user and group identifier of the user running the program,
rather than those on tape.
This is only valid with the
\f4-x\fP option.
.TP
\f4L\fP
Follow symbolic links.
This modifier causes symbolic links to be followed.
By default, symbolic links are not followed.
.TP
\f4k\fP
This modifier uses the \f2tapesize\fP argument as the size in
bytes per volume for non-tape devices (such as a floppy drive).
A value of 0 for \f2tapesize\fP causes multi-volume mode to be
disabled (interpreted as an infinite volume size).
This modifier may be used with the
\f4-c\fP, \f4-r\fP, and \f4-u\fP options.
.TP
\f4F\fP
This modifier uses the \f2incfile\fP argument as a file containing
a list of named files (or directories) to be included
on the tape.
This modifier may only be used with the
\f4-c\fP, \f4-r\fP, and \f4-u\fP options.
This modifier may not be used with the \f4X\fP modifier.
.TP
\f4X\fP
This modifier uses the \f2excfile\fP argument as a file containing
a list of named files (or directories) to be excluded.
This modifier may not be used with the \f4F\fP modifier.
.TP
\f4h\fP
This modifier causes \f4tar\fP to follow symbolic
links as if they were normal files or directories.
Normally \f4tar\fP does not follow symbolic links.
The \f4h\fP modifier may be used with the
\f4-c\fP, \f4-r\fP, and \f4-u\fP options.
.TP
\f4p\fP
This modifier restores the named \f2file\fP arguments
to their original modes,
ignoring the present value returned by \f4umask\fP
[see \f4umask\fP(2) in the \f2Programmer's Reference Manual\fP].
\f4setuid\fP and sticky bit information
are also restored if the effective user ID is root.
This modifier may only be used with the \f4-x\fP option.
.TP
\f4i\fP
This modifier causes \f4tar\fP to ignore directory checksum errors.
.TP
\f4e\fP
This modifier causes \f4tar\fP to quit when certain
minor errors are encountered.
Otherwise \f4tar\fP will continue when minor errors are encountered.
.TP
\f4n\fP
This modifier must be used when the \f2device\fP argument
is for a non-tape device (for example, a floppy drive).
.TP
\f4A\fP
This modifier causes absolute pathnames
for files to be suppressed,
and may be used with the
\f4-r\fP, \f4-c\fP, \f4-u\fP, and \f4-x\fP options.
This causes all pathnames to be interpreted
as relative to the current working directory.
.TP
\f4C\fP
This modifier, on output, sets a flag indicating that all regular
files are compressed.  On input, this modifier sets a flag to decompress
all regular files.

.SH NOTES
There is no way to ask for the \f2n\fP-th
occurrence of a file.
.P
The \f4-b\fP modifier should not be used with
archives that are going to be updated.
The current magnetic tape driver cannot
backspace raw magnetic tape.
If the archive is on a disk file,
the \f4-b\f1 modifier should not be used at all,
because updating an archive stored on disk can destroy it.
.P
The current limit on file name length is
100 characters.
.P
You cannot restore a mulit-level archive created with
UNIX System V Release 4 \f4tar\fP on a pre-Release 4 system.
A false warning message that file permissions have changed will be issued.

.SH NAME
\f4login\f1 \- sign on
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4login
[ \f2name\fP [ \f2environ\fP .\|.\|. ]\|]\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\f4login\fP
command
is used at the beginning of each terminal session
and allows you to identify yourself to the system.
It may be invoked as a command or
by the system when a connection
is first established.
It is invoked by the system when a previous user has
terminated the initial shell by typing a
\f4cntrl-d\f1
to indicate an end-of-file.
.PP
If
\f4login\fP
is invoked as a command it must replace the initial
command interpreter.
This is accomplished by typing
.sp .5
.in +.5i
\f4exec login\f1
.sp .5
.in -.5i
from the initial shell.
.PP
\f4login\fP
asks for your user name (if it is not supplied as an argument), and if
appropriate, your password.
Echoing is turned off (where possible) during the typing of your password,
so it will not appear on the written record of the
session.
.PP
If there are no lower-case characters in the first line of
input processed, \f4login\fP assumes the connecting TTY is
an upper-case-only terminal and sets the port's \f4termio\fP(7) options to
reflect this.
.PP
\f4login\fP accepts a
device option, \f2device\fP.
\f2device\fP is taken to
be the path name of the TTY port \f4login\fP is to operate on.
The use of the device option can be expected to
improve \f4login\fP performance,
since \f4login\fP will not need to call \f4ttyname\fP(3).
.PP
If you make any mistake in the login procedure,
the message
.sp .5
.in +.5i
\f4Login incorrect\f1
.sp .5
.in -.5i
is printed
and a new login prompt will appear.
If you make five incorrect login attempts, all five may be
logged in \f4/var/adm/loginlog\f1 (if it exists)
and the TTY line will be dropped.
.PP
If you do not complete the login successfully within a
certain period of time (e.g.,
one minute), you are likely to be silently disconnected.
.PP
After a successful login, accounting files are updated, the 
\f4/etc/profile\f1
script is executed, the time you last logged in is printed, 
\f4/etc/motd\f1 is printed,
the user-\s-1ID\s+1, group-\s-1ID\s+1, 
supplementary group list,
working directory, and command interpreter
(usually \f4sh\fP)
are initialized,
and the file
\f4\&.profile\f1
in the working directory is executed, if it exists.
The name of the command interpreter is
\f4\-\f1
followed by the last component of the interpreter's path name
(e.g.,
\f4\-sh\f1).
If this field in the password file is empty,
then the default command interpreter,
\f4/usr/bin/sh\f1
is used.
If this field is
*,
then
the named directory becomes the root directory,
the starting point for path searches for path names beginning with a
\f4/\f1.
At that point 
\f4login\fP
is re-executed at the new level which must have
its own root structure,
including
\f4/var/adm/login\f1
and
\f4/etc/passwd\f1.
.PP
The basic
.I environment
is initialized to:
.PP
.RS
\f4\s-1HOME\s+1=\f2your-login-directory\fP
.br
\f4\s-1LOGNAME\s+1=\f2your-login-name\fP
.br
\f4\s-1PATH\s+1=/usr/bin\f1
.br
\f4\s-1SHELL\s+1=\f2last-field-of-passwd-entry\fP
.br
\f4\s-1MAIL\s+1=/var/mail/\f2your-login-name\fP
.br
\f4\s-1TZ\s+1=\f2timezone-specification\fP
.RE
.sp 1v
The environment may be expanded or modified by supplying additional
arguments to
\f4login\f1,
either at execution time or when
\f4login\fP
requests your login name.
The arguments may take either the form
.I xxx
or
.I xxx=yyy.
Arguments without an equal sign are placed
in the environment as
.sp .5
.in +.5i
\f4L\f2n\f1=xxx
.sp .5
.in -.5i
where
.I n
is a number starting at 0 and is incremented each time
a new variable name is required.
Variables containing an
\f4=\f1
are placed in the environment without modification.
If they
already appear in the environment, then they replace the older
value.
There are two exceptions.
The variables
\f4\s-1PATH\s+1\f1
and
\f4\s-1SHELL\s+1\f1
cannot be changed.
This prevents people, logging into restricted
shell environments, from spawning secondary shells which are not
restricted. 
\f4login\fP
understands simple single-character quoting conventions.
Typing a
backslash
in front of a character quotes it and allows the inclusion of such
characters as spaces and tabs.

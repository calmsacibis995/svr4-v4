.SH NAME
trchan \- translate character sets
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4trchan\fP [\f4-ciko\fP] \f2mapfile\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4trchan\fP performs mapping as a filter, using the same format of
\f2mapfile\fP
as 
\f4mapchan\fP [see \f4mapchan\fP(4) for \f2mapfile\fP format].
This allows a file consisting of
one internal character set to be translated to another
internal character set.
.P
\f4trchan\fP reads standard input, maps it, and writes to standard output.
A \f2mapfile\fP must be given on the command line.
Errors cause \f4trchan\fP to stop processing unless \f4-c\fP is specified.
.P
The following options can be used with \f4trchan\fP:
.TP
\f4-c\fP
causes errors to be echoed on \f4stderr\fP, and processing is continued.
.TP
\f4-i\fP
specifies that the input section of the \f2mapfile\fP
is used when translating data.
.TP
\f4-k\fP
specifies that the dead and compose sections of the
\f2mapfile\fP are used when translating data.
.TP
\f4-o\fP
specifies that the output section of the
\f2mapfile\fP is used when translating data.
.IP
The
\f4-i\fP,
\f4-k\fP
and
\f4-o\fP
options can be specified in any combination;
if none are specified, \f4trchan\fP uses the entire
\f2mapfile\fP, as if all three were specified together.

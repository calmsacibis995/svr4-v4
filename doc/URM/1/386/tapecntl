.SH NAME
\f4tapecntl\f1 \- tape control for tape device
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4tapecntl\f1 [\f4\-bluetrwv\f1] [\f4-f \f2arg\f1] [\f4\-p \f2arg\f1] [\f4special\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4tapecntl\f1 will send the optioned commands to the tape device
driver sub-device \f4/dev/rmt/c0s0\f1 for all options except
the \f4-e\f1 option (position), which will use sub-device \f4/dev/rmt/c0s0n\f1
using the \f4ioctl\f1 command function.
Sub-device \f4/dev/rmt/c0s0\f1 provides a rewind on close
capability, while \f4/dev/rmt/c0s0n\f1 allows for closing of the
device without rewind.  
Error messages will be written to standard error.
\f4special\fP is the tape 
device, and it defaults to \f4/dev/rmt/c0s0n\f1 if not specified.
.P
Not all options are supported by all tape devices and tape device drivers.
.P
The meaning of the options are:
.PP
.RS
.TP "\w'\-p[n]\ \ \ 'u"
\f4\-b\f1
block length limits
.br
Reads block length limits from the tape device and displays them.
.TP
\f4\-l\f1
load tape
.br
Loads the tape media to the tape device and positions the tape at BOT.
.TP
\f4\-u\f1
unload tape
.br
Unloads the tape media from the tape device.
Depending on the device, unloading may include ejecting the catridge.
.TP
\f4\-e\f1
erase tape
.br
Erasing the tape causes the erase bar to be activated while
moving the tape from end to end, causing all data tracks to be
erased in a single pass over the tape.
.TP
\f4\-t\f1
retension tape
.br
Retensioning the tape causes the tape to be moved from end to end,
thereby repacking the tape with the proper tension across its length.
.TP
\f4\-r\f1
reset tape device
.br
Reset of the tape device initializes the tape controller registers
and positions the tape at the beginning of the tape mark (BOT).
.TP
\f4\-w\f1
rewind tape
.br
Rewinding the tape will move the tape to the BOT.
.TP
\f4\-v\f1
set variable length block mode
.br
Sets the tape device to read and write variable length blocks.
.TP
\f4\-f\f1[\f2n\f1]
set fixed length block mode
.br
sets the tape device to read abd write in fixed length blocks of \f2n\f1 bytes.
.bp
.TP
\f4\-p\f1[\f2n\f1]
position tape to ``end of file'' mark \- \f2n\f1
.br
Positioning the tape command requires an integer argument.
Positioning the tape will move the tape forward relative to its
current position to the end of the specified file mark.
The positioning option used with an argument of zero will be ignored.
Illegal or out-of-range value arguments to the positioning command
will leave the tape positioned at the end of the last valid file mark.
.RE
.PP
Options may be used individually or strung together
with selected options being
executed sequentially from left to right in the command line.

.SH NOTES
Exit codes and their meanings are as follows:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP "\w'exit\ (4)\ \ \ 'u"
exit (1)
device function could not initiate properly due to
misconnected cables or poorly inserted tape cartridge.
.TP
exit (2)
device function failed to complete properly due to
unrecoverable error condition, either in the command setup or
due to mechanical failure.
.TP
exit (3)
device function failed due to the cartridge being write
protected or to the lack of written data on the tape.
.TP
exit (4)
device \f4/dev/rmt/c0s0n\f1 or \f4/dev/rmt/c0s0\f1
failed to open properly due to already being opened
or claimed by another process.

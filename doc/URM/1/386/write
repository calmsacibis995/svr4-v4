.SH NAME
\f4write\f1 \- write to another user
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4write \f2user\f1
[\f2line\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4write\fP
copies lines from your terminal to that of another user.
When first called, it sends the message:
.PP
.RS
\f4Message from \f1
.I yourname 
\f4(tty\f1??\f4)\f1
[
.I date
\f1]\f4\&.\|.\|.\f1
.RE
.PP
to the person you want to talk to.  When it has successfully
completed the connection, it also sends two bells to your own
terminal to indicate that what you are typing is being sent.
.PP
The recipient of the message should write back at this point.
Communication continues until an end of file is read from the
terminal, an interrupt is sent, or the recipient has executed
"mesg n".  At that point 
\f4write\fP
writes \f4\s-1EOT\s+1\fP on the other terminal and exits.
.PP
If you want to write to a user who is logged in more than once,
the 
\f4line\fP
argument may be used to indicate which line or terminal
to send to (e.g.,
\f4term/12\f1);
otherwise, the first writable instance of
the user found in \f4/var/adm/utmp\f1
is assumed and the
following message posted:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\f4user is logged on more than one place.
You are connected to "\f2terminal\fP\^".
Other locations are:
\f2terminal\f1
.fi
.RE
.PP
Permission to write may be denied or granted by use of the 
\f4mesg\fP
command.
Writing to others is normally allowed by default.
Certain commands,
such as the
\f4pr\fP command,
disallow messages in order to prevent
interference with their output.
However, if the user has super-user permissions,
messages can be forced onto a write-inhibited terminal.
.PP
If the character \f4!\fP is found at the beginning of a line, 
\f4write\fP
calls the shell to execute the rest of the line as a command.
.PP
\f4write\f1
runs
\f4setgid(\|)\f1
[see
\f4setuid\f1(2)]
to the group
.SM ID
\f4tty\f1,
in order to have write permissions on other user's terminals.
.PP
\f4write\f1
will detect non-printable characters before sending them to the
user's terminal.
Control characters will appear as a 
\f1`\f4^\f1'
followed by the appropriate
.SM ASCII
character; characters with the high-order bit set will appear in
\(lqmeta\(rq notation. 
For example,
\f1`\f4\e003\f1'
is displayed as
\f1`\f4^C\f1'
and 
\f1`\f4\e372\f1'
as 
\f1`\f4M\-z\f1'.
.PP
The following protocol is suggested for using 
\f4write\fP:
when you first \f4write\fP to another user, wait for them to
\f4write\fP back before starting to send.
Each person should end a message with a distinctive
signal
(i.e.,
\f4(o)\f1
for ``over'') so that the other person knows when to reply.
The signal
\f4(oo)\f1
(for ``over and out'') is suggested when conversation
is to be terminated.

.SH NAME
\f4face\f1 \- executable for the Framed Access Command Environment Interface
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4face\f1 [\f4\-i\f1 \f2init_file\f1] [\f4\-c\f1 \f2command_file\f1] [\f4\-a\f1 \f2alias_file\f1] [\f2file\f1 .\ .\ . ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f2file\f1 is the full pathname of the file describing
the object to be opened initially, and must follow the naming convention
\f4Menu.\f2xxx\f1 for a menu, \f4Form.\f2xxx\f1 for a form,
and \f4Text.\f2xxx\f1 for a text file,
where \f2xxx\f1 is any string that conforms to the
UNIX system file naming conventions.
The FMLI descriptor \f4lifetime\f1 will be ignored for
all frames opened by argument
to \f4face\f1.
These frames have a lifetime of \f4immortal\f1 by default.
If \f2file\f1 is not specified on the command line,
the AT&T FACE Menu will be opened along with those objects specified by
the \f4LOGINWIN\f1 environment variables.
These variables are found in the user's \f4.environ\f1 file.
.SH FILES
\f4$HOME/pref/.environ\f1
.SH SEE ALSO
\f4env\fP(4)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The \f4face\f1 command will exit with a non-zero exit code if the user
is not properly set up as a FACE user.

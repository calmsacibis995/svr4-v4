.SH NAME
\f4find\f1 \- find files
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4find\f1
\f2path-name-list expression\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4find\fP
recursively descends
the directory hierarchy for
each path name in the
.I path-name-list\^
(that is, one or more path names)
seeking files that match a boolean
.I expression\^
written in the primaries given below.
In the descriptions, the argument
.I n\^
is used as a decimal integer
where
\f4+\f2n\^\f1
means more than
.IR n ,
\f4\-\f2n\^\f1
means less than
.I n\^
and
.I n\^
means exactly
.IR n .
Valid expressions are:
.TP 16
\f4\-name\f2 pattern\^\f1
True if
.I pattern\^
matches the current file name.
Normal shell
file name generation characters
(see
\f4sh\f1(1))
may be used.
A backslash (\f4\|\e\|\fP) is used as an escape character within the pattern.
The pattern should be escaped or quoted when
\f4find\fP
is invoked from the shell.
.TP 16
\f4\-perm \f1[\f4-\f1]\f2onum\^\f1
True if the file permission flags
exactly
match the
octal number
.I onum\^
(see
\f4chmod\fP(1)).
If
.I onum\^
is prefixed by a minus sign (\f(CW-\f1),
only the bits that are set in
.I onum\^
are compared with the file permission flags,
and the expression evaluates true if they match.
.TP 16
\f4\-size\f1 \f2n\fP[\f4c\f1]
True if the file is
.I n\^
blocks long (512 bytes per block).
If
.I n
is followed by a
\f4c\f1,
the size is in characters.
.TP 16
\f4\-atime\f2 n\^\f1
True if the file was accessed
.I n\^
days ago.
The access time of directories in 
.I path-name-list\^
is changed by 
\f4find\fP
itself.
.TP 16
\f4\-mtime\f2 n\^\f1
True if the file's data was modified
.I n\^
days ago.
.TP 16
\f4\-ctime\f2 n\^\f1
True if the file's status was changed
.I n\^
days ago.
.TP 16
\f4\-exec\f2 cmd\^\f1
True if the executed
.I cmd\^
returns
a zero value as exit status.
The end of
.I cmd\^
must be punctuated by an escaped
semicolon.
A command argument
\f4{}\f1
is replaced by the
current path name.
.TP 16
\f4\-ok\f2 cmd\^\f1
Like
\f4\-exec\f1
except that the generated command line is printed
with a question mark first,
and is executed only if the user responds
by typing
\f4y\f1.
.TP 16
\f4\-print\f1
Always true;
causes the current path name to be printed.
.TP 16
\f4\-newer\f2 file\^\f1
True if
the current file has been modified more recently than the argument
.IR file .
.TP 16
\f4\-depth\f1
Always true;
causes descent of the directory hierarchy to be done
so that all entries in a directory are
acted on 
before the directory itself.
This can be useful when 
\f4find\fP
is used with
\f4cpio\fP(1)
to transfer files
that are contained in directories without 
write permission.
.TP 16
\f4\-mount\f1
Always true;
restricts the search to the file system containing the directory specified.
.TP 16
\f4\-local\f1
True if the file physically resides on the local system.
.TP 16
\f4(\f2 expression \f4)\f1
True if the parenthesized expression is true
(parentheses are special to the shell and must be escaped).
.TP 16
\f4\-type\f2 c\^\f1
True if the type of the file
is
.IR c ,
where
.I c\^
is
\f4b\f1,
\f4c\f1,
\f4d\f1,
\f4l\f1,
\f4p\f1,
or
\f4f\f1
for
block special file, character special file,
directory, symbolic link, fifo (named pipe), or plain file, respectively.
.TP 16
\f4\-follow\f1
Always true; causes symbolic links to be followed.
When following symbolic links, \f4find\fP keeps track
of the directories visited so that it can detect infinite
loops; for example, such a loop would occur if a symbolic link pointed
to an ancestor.
This expression should not be used with the \f4\-type l\f1 expression.
.TP 16
\f4\-links\f2 n\^\f1
True if the file has
.I n\^
links.
.TP 16
\f4\-user\f2 uname\^\f1
True if the file belongs to the user
\f2uname\fP.
If
\f2uname\fP
is numeric and does not appear as a login name in the
\f4/etc/passwd\f1
file, it is taken as a user \s-1ID\s0.
.TP 16
\f4\-nouser\f1
True if the file belongs to a user not in the
\f4/etc/passwd\f1
file.
.TP 16
\f4\-group\f2 gname\^\f1
True if the file belongs to the group
.IR gname .
If 
.I gname\^
is numeric and does not appear in the
\f4/etc/group\f1
file, it is taken as a group \s-1ID\s0.
.TP 16
\f4\-nogroup\f1
True if the file belongs to a group not in the 
\f4/etc/group\f1
file.
.TP 16
\f4\-fstype \f2type\f1
True if the filesystem to which the file belongs is of type
.I type\fR.
.TP 16
\f4\-inum \f2n\f1
True if the file has inode number
.IR n .
.TP 16
\f4\-prune\f1
Always yields true.
Do not examine any directories or files
in the directory structure below the \f2pattern\f1
just matched.
See the examples, below.
.PP
The primaries may be combined using the following operators
(in order of decreasing precedence):
.TP 4
1)
The negation of a primary
\f1(\f4!\f1
is the unary
.I not\^
operator).
.TP 4
2)
Concatenation of primaries
(the
.I and\^
operation
is implied by the juxtaposition of two primaries).
.TP 4
3)
Alternation of primaries
\f1(\f4\-o\f1 is the
.I or\^
operator).
.PP
Note that when you use \f4find\fP in conjunction with \f4cpio\fP,
if you use the \f4\-L\f1 option with \f4cpio\fP
then you must use the \f4\-follow\f1 expression with \f4find\fP and vice versa.
Otherwise there will be undesirable results.
.SH EXAMPLES
Remove all files in your home directory
named \f4a.out\fP or \f4\(**.o\fP that
have not been accessed for a week:
.sp .5
.ce
\f4find $HOME \e\|( \-name a.out \-o \-name \(fm\(**.o\(fm \e\|) \-atime +7 \-exec rm {} \e\|;\f1
.PP
Recursively print all file names in the current directory and below,
but skipping
.SM SCCS
directories:
.ce
.sp .5
\f4find . \-name \s-1SCCS\s0 \-prune \-o \-print\f1
.fi
.PP
Recursively print all file names in the current directory and below,
skipping the contents of
.SM SCCS
directories, but printing out the
.SM SCCS
directory name:
.sp .5
.ce
\f4find . \-print \-name \s-1SCCS\s0 \-prune\f1
.fi

.SH NOTE
When using \f4find\fP
to determine files modified within a range of time,
one must use the
\f4\?time\f1
argument BEFORE the
\f4\-print\f1
argument otherwise \f4find\fP
will give all files.
.PP
The following option is obsolete and will not be supported in
future releases.
.TP 16
\f4\-cpio\f2 device\^\f1
Always true;
write the current file on
.I device\^
in
\f4cpio\fP(1)
format (5120-byte records).

.SH NAME
\f4acctcom\f1 \- search and print process accounting file(s)
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4acctcom\f1
[
.I options
] [
\f2file\f1 . . . ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4acctcom\fP
reads
.IR file ,
the standard input, or
\f4/var/adm/pacct\f1,
in the form described by
\f4acct\fP(4)
and writes selected records to the standard output.
Each record represents the execution of one process.
The output shows the
\f5COMMAND NAME\f1,
\f5USER\f1,
\f5TTYNAME\f1,
\f5START TIME\f1,
\f5END TIME\f1,
\f5REAL (SEC)\f1,
\f5CPU (SEC)\f1,
\f5MEAN SIZE (K)\f1,
and optionally,
\f5F\f1
(the
\f4fork\fP/\f4exec\fP
flag:
\f41\fP for \f4fork\fP without \f4exec\fP),
\f5STAT\f1
(the system exit status),
\f5HOG FACTOR\f1,
\f5KCORE MIN\f1,
\f5CPU FACTOR\f1,
\f5CHARS TRNSFD\f1,
and 
\f5BLOCKS READ\f1
(total blocks read and written).
.PP
A \f4#\f1 is prepended to the command name
if the command was executed with
superuser
privileges.
If a process is not associated with a known terminal,
a \f4?\fP is printed in the
\f5TTYNAME\f1
field.
.PP
If no \f2files\fP are specified, and
if the standard input is associated with a terminal
or
\f4/dev/null\f1
(as is the case when using
\f4&\f1
in the shell),
\f4/var/adm/pacct\f1
is read; otherwise, the standard input is read.
.PP
If any
.I file\^
arguments are given,
they are read in their respective order.
Each file is normally read forward, i.e., in chronological order
by process completion time.
The file
\f4/var/adm/pacct\f1
is usually the current file to be examined;
a busy system may need several such files
of which all but the current file are found in
\f4/var/adm/pacct\f2incr\f1.
.PP
The \f2options\fP are:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP 12
\f4\-a\f1
Show some average statistics about the processes selected.
The statistics will be printed after the output records.
.TP
\f4\-b\f1
Read backwards, showing latest commands first.
This option has no effect when the standard input is read.
.TP
\f4\-f\f1
Print the
\f4fork\fP/\f4exec\fP
flag and system exit status columns in the output.
The numeric output for this option will be in octal.
.TP
\f4\-h\f1
Instead of mean memory size,
show the fraction of total available
.SM CPU
time consumed by the process
during its execution.
This ``hog factor'' is computed as (total \s-1CPU\s+1\ time)/(elapsed\ time).
.TP
\f4\-i\f1
Print columns containing the \s-1I/O\s0 counts in the output.
.TP
\f4\-k\f1
Instead of memory size, show total kcore-minutes.
.TP
\f4\-m\f1
Show mean core size (the default).
.TP
\f4\-r\f1
Show
.SM CPU
factor (user-time/(system-time + user-time)).
.TP
\f4\-t\f1
Show separate system and user
.SM CPU
times.
.TP
\f4\-v\f1
Exclude column headings from the output.
.TP
\f4\-l\f2 line\f1
Show only processes belonging to terminal
\f4/dev/term/\fP\f2line\fP.
.TP
\f4\-u\f2 user\f1
Show only processes belonging to
.I user\^
that may be specified by: a user \s-1ID\s0,
a login name
that is then converted to a user \s-1ID\s0,
a \f4#\fP, which designates only those processes executed with
superuser
privileges, or \f4?\fP,
which designates only those processes associated with unknown
user \s-1ID\s0s.
.TP
\f4\-g\f2 group\f1
Show only processes belonging to
\f2group\fP.
The \f2group\fP may be designated by either the
group \s-1ID\s+1 or group name.
.TP
\f4\-s\f2 time\f1
Select processes existing at or after
.IR time\^ ,
given in the format
.IR hr \|[\|:\^ min \|[\|:\^ sec \|]\|]\^.
.TP
\f4\-e\f2 time\f1
Select processes existing at or before
.IR time\^ .
.TP
\f4\-S\f2 time\f1
Select processes starting at or after
.IR time\^ .
.TP
\f4\-E\f2 time\f1
Select processes ending at or before
.IR time .
Using the same
.I time
for both
\f4\-S\f1
and
\f4\-E\f1
shows the processes that existed at
.IR time .
.TP
\f4\-n\f2 pattern\f1
Show only commands matching
.I pattern\^
that may be a regular expression as in
\f4regcmp\fP(3G), except + means one or more occurrences.
.TP
\f4\-q\f1
Do not print any output records, just print the average statistics as with
the
\f4\-a\f1
option.
.TP
\f4\-o\f2 ofile\f1
Copy selected process records in the input data format to
.IR ofile ;
suppress printing to standard output.
.TP
\f4\-H\f2 factor\f1
Show only processes that exceed
\f2factor\fP,
where factor is the ``hog factor'' as explained in option
\f4\-h\f1
above.
.TP
\f4\-O\f2 sec\f1
Show only processes with
.SM CPU
system time exceeding
.I sec
seconds.
.TP
\f4\-C\f2 sec\f1
Show only processes with total
.SM CPU
time (system-time + user-time) exceeding
.I sec
seconds.
.TP
\f4\-I\f2 chars\f1
Show only processes transferring more characters than
the cutoff number given by
.IR chars .

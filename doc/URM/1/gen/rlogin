.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\f4rlogin\f1
establishes a remote login session from
your terminal to the remote machine named
.IR hostname .
.LP
Hostnames are listed in the 
.I hosts 
database,
which may be contained in the
\f4/etc/hosts\f1
file,
the Internet domain name server,
or in both.
Each host has one official name (the
first name in the database entry),
and optionally one or more nicknames.
Either official hostnames or nicknames may be specified in
.IR hostname.
.LP
Each remote machine may have a file named
\f4/etc/hosts.equiv\f1
containing a list of trusted hostnames
with which it shares usernames.
Users with the same username on both the local
and remote machine may 
.nh
\f4rlogin \f1
.hy
from the
machines listed in the remote machine's
\f4/etc/hosts.equiv\f1
file without supplying a password.
Individual users
may set up a similar private equivalence list with the file
\f4\&.rhosts\f1
in their home directories.
Each line in this file contains two names: a
.I hostname
and a
.I username
separated by a 
space.
An entry in a remote user's
\f4\&.rhosts\f1
file permits the user named
.I username
who is logged into
.I hostname
to log in to the remote machine as the remote user
without supplying a password.
If the name of the local host is not found in the 
\f4/etc/hosts.equiv\f1
file on the remote machine,
and the local username and hostname are not found in
the remote user's 
\f4\&.rhosts \f1
file, then
the remote machine will prompt for a password.
Hostnames listed in 
\f4/etc/hosts.equiv\f1
and 
\f4\&.rhosts\f1
files must be the official hostnames listed in the hosts database;
nicknames may not be used in either of these files.
.LP
To counter security problems, the
\f4\&.rhosts\f1
file must be owned by
either the remote user or by root.
.LP
The remote terminal type is the same as your local
terminal type (as given in your environment
\f4TERM\f1
variable).  The terminal or window size
is also copied to the remote system
if the server supports the option, and
changes in size are reflected as well.
All echoing takes place at the remote site, so that (except for
delays) the remote login is transparent.  Flow control using
\f4CTRL-S\f1
and
\&\f4CTRL-Q\f1
and
flushing of input and output on interrupts are handled properly.
.LP
The following options are available:
.TP
\f4\-L\f1
Allow the
\f4rlogin\f1
session to be run in \(lqlitout\(rq mode.
.TP 
\f4\-8\f1
Pass eight-bit data across the net instead of seven-bit data.
.\"this is the default.
.TP 
\f4\-e \f2c\f1
Specify a different escape character,
.IR c ,
for the line used to disconnect from the remote host.
.\".IP \fB\-7\fP 5
.\"Pass seven-bit data across the net instead of eight-bit data.
.TP 
\f4\-l \f2username\f1
Specify a different
.I username
for the remote login.  If you do not use
this option, the remote username used is the
same as your local username.
.SS Escape Sequences
.LP
Lines that you type which start with the tilde
character are \(lqescape sequences\(rq (the
escape character can be changed using the
\f4\-e\f1
options):
.TP
\f4~\^.\f1
Disconnect from the remote host \(em this is not the same as a logout,
because the local host breaks the connection with no warning to the
remote end.
.TP
\f4susp\f1
Suspend the login session (only if you are using a shell
with Job Control).
\f4susp\f1
is your \(lqsuspend\(rq character, usually
\f4\CTRL-Z\f1,
see
\f4tty\f1(1).

.SH NOTES
.LP
When a system is listed in
\f4hosts.equiv\f1, its security must be as good as
local security.  One insecure system listed in
\f4hosts.equiv\f1 can compromise the security of the entire
system.
.LP
When a line of the form \f2hostname username\f1 appears in 
\f4hosts.equiv\f1, the user named may log in as anyone in the 
local password file by using the command
.PP
.RS
\f4rlogin \-l \f2username hostname\f1
.RE
.PP
where \f2username\f1 is any valid username in the \f4passwd\f1 
file.
.LP
If you use a windowing terminal and you intend 
to run \f4layers\f1(1) on the remote system, then you must 
invoke \f4rlogin\f1 with the \f4\-8\f1 option.
.LP
This implementation can only use the
.SM TCP
network service.

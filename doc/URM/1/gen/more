.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4more\f1
is a filter that displays the contents of a text
file
on the terminal, one screenful at a time.
It normally pauses after
each screenful, and prints
\f4--More--\f1
at the bottom of the screen.
\f4more\f1
provides a two-line overlap between screens for continuity.
If
\f4more\f1
is reading from a file rather than a pipe, the percentage of
characters displayed so far is also shown.
.PP
\f4more\f1
scrolls up to display one more line in response to a
.SM RETURN
character; it displays another screenful in response to a
.SM SPACE
character.
Other commands are listed below.
.PP
\f4page\fP
clears the screen before displaying the next screenful of text;
it only provides a one-line overlap between screens.
.PP
\f4more\f1
sets the terminal
to
.I noecho
mode, so that the output can be continuous.
Commands that you type do not normally show up on your terminal,
except for the
\f4/\f1
and
\f4!\f1
commands.
.PP
If the standard output is not a terminal,
\f4more\f1
acts just like
\f4cat\f1(1V),
except that a header is printed before each file in a series.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are available with
\f4more\f1:
.TP .75i
\f4\-c\f1
Clear before displaying.
Redrawing the screen instead of scrolling
for faster displays.
This option is ignored if
the terminal does not have the ability to clear to the end of a line.
.TP
\f4\-d\f1
Display error messages rather than ringing the terminal bell if
an unrecognized command is used.
This is helpful for inexperienced users.
.TP
\f4\-f\f1
Do not fold long lines.
This is useful when lines contain
nonprinting characters or escape sequences, such as those generated
when
\f4nroff\f1(1)
output is piped through
\f4ul\f1(1).
.TP
\f4\-l\f1
Do not treat
.SM FORMFEED
characters (CTRL-d) as \(lqpage breaks.\(rq If
\f4\-l\f1
is not used,
\f4more\f1
pauses to accept commands after any line containing a
\f4^L\f1
character (CTRL-d).
Also, if a file begins with a
.SM FORMFEED\s0,
the screen is cleared before the file is printed.
.TP
\f4\-r\f1
Normally,
\f4more\f1
ignores control characters that it does not interpret in some way.
The
\f4\-r\f1
option causes these to be displayed as
\f4^\f2C\f1
where
.I C
stands for any such control character.
.TP
\f4\-s\f1
Squeeze.
Replace multiple blank lines with a single
blank line.
This is helpful when viewing
\f4nroff\f1(1)
output, on the screen.
.TP
\f4\-u\f1
Suppress generation of underlining escape sequences.
Normally, \f4more\f1
handles underlining, such as that produced by \f4nroff\f1(1),
in a manner appropriate to the terminal.
If the terminal can
perform underlining or has a stand-out mode,
\f4more\f1
supplies appropriate escape sequences as called for in the
text file.
.TP
\f4\-w\f1
Normally,
\f4more\f1
exits when it comes to the end of its input.
With
\f4\-w\f1,
however,
\f4more\f1 prompts and waits for any key to be struck before exiting.
.TP
\f4\-\f2lines\f1
Display the indicated number of
.I lines
in each screenful, rather than the default (the number of lines
in the terminal screen less two).
.TP
\f4+\f2linenumber\fP\f1
Start up at
.IR linenumber .
.TP
\f4+/\f2pattern\fP\f1
Start up two lines above the line containing the
regular expression \f2pattern\f1.
Note: unlike
editors, this construct should
.I not
end with a
\f1`\f4/\f1'.
If it does, then the trailing slash is taken as a character in the
search pattern.

.SH USAGE
.SS Environment
.LP
\f4more\f1
uses the terminal's
\f4termcap\f1(5)
entry to determine its display characteristics, and
looks in the environment variable
.SB MORE
for any preset options.
For instance, to page through files using
the
\f4\-c\f1
mode by default, set the value of this variable to
\f4\-c\f1.
(Normally, the command sequence to set up this
environment variable is placed in the
\f4\&.login\f1
or
\f4\&.profile\f1
file).
.SS Commands
.LP
The commands take effect immediately;  it is not necessary to
type a carriage return.
Up to the time when the command character itself is given,
the user may type the line kill character to cancel the numerical
argument being formed.
In addition, the user may type the erase character to redisplay the
\f1`\f4--More--(\f2xx\fP%)\f1'
message.
.LP
In the following commands,
.I i
is a numerical argument
\f1(\f41\f1
by default).
.TP 10
.IR i \s-1SPACE\s0
Display another screenful, or
.I i
more lines if
.I i
is specified.
.TP
.IR i \s-1RETURN\s0
Display another line, or
.I i
more lines, if specified.
.TP
\f2i\f4^D\f1
(CTRL-d)
Display (scroll down) 11 more lines.
If
.I i
is given, the scroll size is set to
.IR i\| .
.TP
.IR i d
Same as
\f4^D\f1.
.TP
\f2i\f4z\f1
Same as
.SM SPACE,
except that
.IR i\| ,
if present, becomes the new default number
of lines per screenful.
.TP
\f2i\f4s\f1
Skip
.I i\|
lines and then print a screenful.
.TP
\f2i\f4f\f1
Skip
.I i
screenfuls and then print a screenful.
.TP
\f2i\f4^B\f1
(CTRL-b)
Skip back
.I i
screenfuls and then print a screenful.
.TP
.I b
Same as
\f4^B\f1
(CTRL-d).
.br
.ne 1i
.PD 0
.TP
\f4q\f1
.TP
\f4Q\f1
Exit from \f4more\f1.
.PD
.TP
\f4=\f1
Display the current line number.
.TP
\f4v\f1
Drop into the
editor indicated by the \f4EDITOR\f1 environment variable,
at the current line of the current file.
The default editor is \f4ed\f1(1).
.TP
\f4h\f1
Help.
Give a description of all the
\f4more\f1
commands.
.TP
\f2i\f4/\f2pattern\f1
Search forward for the
.IR i\| th
occurrence of the regular expression
.IR pattern .
Display the screenful starting two lines before the line
that contains the
.IR i\| th
match for the regular expression
.IR pattern ,
or the end of a pipe, whichever comes first.
If
\f4more\f1
is displaying a file and there is no such match, its position
in the file remains unchanged.
Regular expressions can be
edited using erase and kill characters.
Erasing back past the first column cancels the search command.
.TP
\f2i\f4n\f1
Search for the
.IR i\| th
occurrence of the last
.I pattern
entered.
.TP
\f4\'\f1
Single quote.
Go to the point from which the last search started.
If no search has been performed in the current file,
go to the beginning of the file.
.TP
\f4!\f2command\f1
Invoke a shell to execute
.IR command\| .
The characters
\f4%\f1
and
\f4!\f1,
when used within
.I command
are replaced with the current filename
and the previous shell command,
respectively.
If there is no current filename,
\f4%\f1
is not expanded.
Prepend a backslash to these characters to
escape expansion.
.TP
\f2i\f4:n\f1
Skip to the
.IR i\| th
next filename given in the command line,
or to the last filename in the list if
.I i
is out of range.
.TP
\f2i\f4:p\f1
Skip to the
.IR i\| th
previous filename given in the command line,
or to the first filename if
.I i
is out of range.
If given while
\f4more\f1
is positioned within a file, go to the
beginning of the file.
If
\f4more\f1
is reading from a pipe,
\f4more\f1
simply rings the terminal bell.
.br
.ne 2
.TP
\f4:f\f1
Display the current filename and line number.
.br
.ne 5
.PD 0
.TP
\f4:q\f1
.TP
\f4:Q\f1
Exit from \f4more\f1 (same as \f4q\f1 or \f4Q\f1).
.PD
.TP
\f4\&.\f1
Dot.
Repeat the previous command.
.TP
\f4\s+3^\s0\|\e\f1
Halt a partial display of text.
\f4more\f1
stops sending output, and displays the usual
\f4--More--\f1
prompt.
Unfortunately, some output is lost as a result.

.SH NAME
\f4touch\f1 \- update access and modification times of a file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4touch\f1
[
\f4\-amc\f1
] [ \f2mmddhhmm\f1[\f2yy\f1] ] \f2files\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4touch\fP
causes the access and modification times of each
argument to be updated.
The file name is created if it does not exist.
If no time is specified [see \f4date\f1(1)]
the current time is used.
The
\f4\-a\f1
and
\f4\-m\f1
options cause touch to update only the access or modification
times respectively (default is
\f4\-am\f1).
The
\f4\-c\f1
option silently prevents
\f4touch\fP
from creating the file if it did not
previously exist.
.PP
The return code from
\f4touch\fP
is the number of files for which the times could not
be successfully modified
(including files that did not exist and were not created).

.SH NOTES
.PP
Users familiar with the
.SM BSD
environment will find that the
\f4\-f\f1
option is accepted, but ignored.
The
\f4\-f\f1
option is unnecessary since
\f4touch\f1
will succeed for all files owned by the user regardless of
the permissions on the files.
.P
\f4touch\fP assumes that an all numeric entry is a date and
so will not update the times for a file
when an all numeric filename is specified.

\f4mailx\f1 \- interactive message processing system
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4mailx\f1
[
.I options
] [
.IR name \|.\|.\|.\|
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The command
\f4mailx\fP provides a comfortable, flexible environment for sending and
receiving messages electronically.
When reading mail,
\*(Ma provides commands to facilitate saving, deleting, and responding to
messages.
When sending mail,
\*(Ma allows editing, reviewing and other modification of the message
as it is entered.
.PP
Many of the remote features of \f4mailx\fP
work only if the Basic Networking Utilities are installed on your system.
.PP
Incoming mail is stored in a standard file for each user,
called the \*(mx for that user.
When \*(Ma is called to read messages,
the \*(mx is the default place to find them.
As messages are read,
they are marked to be moved to a secondary file for storage,
unless specific action is taken,
so that the messages need not be seen again.
This secondary file is called the \*(mb
and is normally located in the user's
\f4HOME\f1
directory
[see 
.Ev MBOX
(\*(EV) for a description of this file].
Messages can be saved in other secondary files named by the user.
Messages remain in a secondary file until forcibly removed.
.PP
The user can access a secondary file by using the 
\f4\-f\f1 option of the \*(Ma command.
Messages in the secondary file can then be read or otherwise
processed using the same \*(CM as in the primary \*(mx.
This gives rise within these pages to the notion of a current \*(mx.
.PP
On the command line,
.I options
start with a dash (\-) and any other arguments are taken to be
destinations (recipients).
If no recipients are specified,
\*(Ma attempts to read messages from the \*(mx.
Command-line options are:
.PP
.RS
.TP 14
\f4\-d\f1
Turn on debugging output.
.TP
\f4\-e\f1
Test for presence of mail.
\f4mailx\fP prints nothing and exits with a successful return code if there is
mail to read.
.TP
\f4\-f\f1 [\*(fn]
Read messages from \*(fn instead of \*(mx.
If no \*(fn is specified,
the \*(mb is used.
.TP
\f4\-F\f1
Record the message in a file named after the first recipient.
Overrides the
.Ev record
variable, if set (see \*(EV).
.TP
\f4\-h\f1 \*(nu
The number of network ``hops'' made so far.
This is provided for network
software to avoid infinite delivery loops.
This option and its argument is passed to the delivery program.
.TP
\f4\-H\f1
Print header summary only.
.TP
\f4\-i\f1
Ignore interrupts.
See also
.Ev ignore
(\*(EV).
.TP
\f4\-I\f1
Include the newsgroup and article-id header lines when printing mail
messages.
This option requires the \f4\-f\f1 option to be specified.
.TP
\f4\-n\f1
Do not initialize from the system default
.I mailx.rc
file.
.TP
\f4\-N\f1
Do not print initial header summary.
.TP
\f4\-r\f2 address\f1
Use
.I address
as the return address when invoking the delivery program.
All tilde commands are disabled.
This option and its argument is passed to the delivery program.
.TP
\f4\-s\f2 subject\f1
Set the Subject header field to
.IR subject .
.TP
\f4\-T\f2 file\f1
Message-id and article-id header lines are recorded in \f2file\f1 after the
message is read.
This option will also set the \f4\-I\f1 option.
.TP
\f4\-u\f2 user\f1
Read
.IR user 's
\*(mx.
This is only effective if
.IR user 's
\*(mx is not read protected.
.TP
\f4\-U\f1
Convert \f4uucp\fP style addresses to internet standards.
Overrides the
.Ev conv
environment variable.
.TP
\f4\-V\f1
Print the \*(Ma version number and exit.
.RE
.PP
When reading mail,
\*(Ma is in
\f2command mode\f1.
A header summary of the first several messages is displayed,
followed by a prompt indicating \*(Ma can accept regular commands
(see \*(CM below).
When sending mail,
\*(Ma is in
\f2input mode\f1.
If no subject is specified on the command line,
a prompt for the subject is printed.
(A subject longer than 1024 characters causes \*(Ma to print the
message \f2mail: ERROR signal 10\fP; the mail will not be delivered.)
As the message is typed,
\*(Ma reads the message and store it in a temporary
file.
Commands may be entered by beginning a line with the tilde (~) escape
character followed by a single command letter and optional arguments.
See \*(TX for a summary of these commands.
.PP
At any time,
the behavior of \*(Ma is governed by a set of
\f2environment variables\f1.
These are flags and valued parameters which are set and cleared via the
\f4se\f1t
and
\f4uns\f1et
commands.
See \*(EV below for a summary of these parameters.
.PP
Recipients listed on the command line may be of three types:
login names,
shell commands,
or
alias groups.
Login names may be any network address,
including mixed network addressing.
If mail is found to be undeliverable, an attempt is
made to return it to the sender's \f2mailbox\f1.
If the recipient name begins with a pipe symbol ( | ),
the rest of the name is taken to be a shell command to pipe the
message through.
This provides an automatic interface with any program that reads the standard
input, such as
\f4lp\fP(1)
for recording outgoing mail on paper.
Alias groups are set by the
\f4a\f1lias
command (see \*(CM below)
and are lists of recipients of any type.
.PP
Regular commands are of the form
.PP
.RS
[
.I command
] [
.I msglist
] [
.I arguments
]
.RE
.PP
If no command is specified in \f2command mode\f1,
\f4p\f1rint
is assumed.
In \f2input mode\f1,
commands are recognized by the escape character,
and lines not treated as commands are taken as input for the message.
.PP
Each message is assigned a sequential number,
and there is at any time the notion of a current message,
marked by a right angle bracket (>) in the header summary.
Many commands take an optional list of messages
(\*(ml) to operate on. 
The default for \f2msglist\f1 is the current message.
A \*(ml is a list of message identifiers separated by spaces,
which may include:
.PP
.RS
.TP 8
\f4n\f1
Message number
\f4n\f1.
.TP
\f4\&.\f1
The current message.
.TP
\f4^\f1
The first undeleted message.
.TP
\f4$\f1
The last message.
.TP
\f4*\f1
All messages.
.TP
\f4n\-m\f1
An inclusive range of message numbers.
.TP
\f4user\f1
All messages from
\f4user\f1.
.TP
\f4/string\f1
All messages with
\f4string\f1
in the subject line (case ignored).
.TP
\f4:\f2c\f1
All messages of type
.IR c ,
where
.I c
is one of:
.RE
.RS 13
.TP
\f4d\f1
deleted messages
.TP
\f4n\f1
new messages
.TP
\f4o\f1
old messages
.TP
\f4r\f1
read messages
.TP
\f4u\f1
unread messages
.RE 0
.RS 13
Note that the context of the command determines whether this type of
message specification makes sense.
.RE
.PP
Other arguments are usually arbitrary strings whose usage
depends on the command involved.
File names,
where expected,
are expanded via the normal shell conventions [see
\f4sh\fP(1)].
Special characters are recognized by certain commands and are
documented with the commands below.
.PP
At start-up time,
\*(Ma tries to execute commands from the optional system-wide file
(\f4/etc/mail/mailx.rc\f1) to initialize
certain parameters,
then from a private start-up file
\f1(\f4$HOME/.mailrc\f1)
for personalized variables.
With the exceptions noted below, 
regular commands are legal inside start-up files.
The most common use of a start-up file is 
to set up initial display options and alias lists.
The following commands are not legal in the start-up file:
\f4!\f1,
\f4C\f1opy,
\f4e\f1dit,
\f4fo\f1llowup,
\f4F\f1ollowup,
\f4ho\f1ld,
\f4m\f1ail,
\f4pre\f1serve,
\f4r\f1eply,
\f4R\f1eply,
\f4sh\f1ell,
and
\f4v\f1isual.
An error in the start-up file causes the remaining lines in the file to
be ignored.
The \*(mr file is optional, and must be constructed locally.

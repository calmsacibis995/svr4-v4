.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4file\fP
performs a series of tests on each file supplied by \f2arg\fP
and, optionally, on each file supplied in \f2ffile\fP
in an attempt to classify it.
If \f2arg\f1 appears to be a text file,
\f4file\fP
examines the first 512 bytes
and tries to guess its programming language.
If \f2arg\f1 is an executable
\f4a.out\f1,
\f4file\fP
prints the version stamp, provided it is greater than 0.
If \f2arg\f1 is a symbolic link, by default the link is followed
and \f4file\f1 tests the file that the symbolic link references.
.PP
.TP .6i
\f4\-c\f1
Check the magic file for format errors.
For reasons of efficiency, this validation is normally not carried out.
.TP
\f4\-f\f2 ffile\f1
\f2ffile\fP
contains the names
of the files to be examined.
.TP
\f4\-h\f1
Do not follow symbolic links.
.TP
\f4\-m\f2 mfile\f1
Use \f2mfile\f1 as an alternate magic file,
instead of \f4/etc/magic\f1.
.PP
\f4file\fP
uses
\f4/etc/magic\f1
to identify files that have a magic number.
A magic number is a numeric or string constant that indicates the file type.
Commentary at the beginning of
\f4/etc/magic\f1
explains its format.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
If the
\f4\-h\fP
option is specified and
\f2arg\fP
is a symbolic link,
\f4file\f1 prints the error message:
.PP
.RS
.ft 4
symbolic link to \f2arg\fP

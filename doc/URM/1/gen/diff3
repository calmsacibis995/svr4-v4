.SH NAME
\f4diff3\f1 \- 3-way differential file comparison
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4diff3\f1
[
\f4\-exEX3\f1
]
.I file1 file2 file3
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4diff3\fP
compares three versions of a file,
and publishes disagreeing ranges of text
flagged with these codes:
.RS
.TP 16
\f4====\f1
all three files differ
.TP 16
\f4====1\f1
.IR file1 " is different"
.TP 16
\f4====2\f1
.IR file2 " is different"
.TP 16
\f4====3\f1
.IR file3 " is different"
.RE
.PP
The type of change suffered in converting a given range
of a given file to some other is
indicated in one of these ways:
.RS
.TP 16
\f2f\f4 : \f2n1\f4 a\f1
Text is to be appended after line number
.I n1\^
in file
.IR f ,
where
.I f\^
= 1, 2, or 3.
.TP 16
\f2f\f4 : \f2n1\f4 , \f2n2\f4 c\f1
Text is to be
changed in the range line
.I n1\^
to line
.IR n2 .
If 
.I n1\^
=
.IR n 2,
the range may be abbreviated to
.IR n1 .
.RE
.PP
The original contents of the range follows immediately
after a
\f4c\f1
indication.
When the contents of two
files are identical, the contents of the lower-numbered
file is suppressed.
.TP
\f4\-e\f1
Produce a script for the editor
\f4ed\fP(1)
that will incorporate into
.I file1\^
all changes between
.I file2\^
and
.IR file3 ,
that is, the changes that normally would be flagged \f4====\f1 and \f4====3\f1.
.TP
\f4\-x\f1
Produce a script to incorporate
only changes flagged \f4====\f1.
.TP
\f4\-3\f1
Produce a script to incorporate
only changes flagged \f4====3\f1.
.TP
\f4\-E\f1
Produce a script that will incorporate all changes between
.I file2
and
.IR file3 ,
but treat overlapping changes (that is, changes that would
be flagged with
\f4====\f1
in the normal listing) differently.
The overlapping lines from both files will be inserted by
the edit script, bracketed by
\f4<<<<<<\f1
and
\f4>>>>>>\f1
lines.
.TP
\f4\-X\f1
Produce a script that will incorporate only changes flagged
\f4====\f1,
but treat these changes in the manner of the
\f4\-E\f1
option.
.PP
The following command will apply the resulting script to
.IR file1 .

Text lines that consist of a single \f4.\f1 will defeat
\f4\-e\f1.

Files longer than 64K bytes will not work.

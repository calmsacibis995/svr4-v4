.SH NAME
\f4grep\f1 \- search a file for a pattern
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4grep\f1
[\f2options\f1] \f2limited_regular_expression\f1 [\f2file\f1 . . . ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4grep\fP searches files for a pattern and prints all lines that contain
that pattern.
\f4grep\fP
uses limited regular expressions (expressions that have string values
that use a subset of the possible alphanumeric and special characters) like
those used with
\f4ed\fP(1)
to match the patterns.
It uses a compact non-deterministic algorithm.
.PP
Be careful using the characters
\f4$\f1,
\f4\(**\f1,
\f4[\f1,
\f4^\f1,
\(bv,
\f4(\f1,
\f4)\f1,
and \f4\e\f1
in the \f2limited_regular_expression\f1 
because they are also meaningful to the shell.
It is safest to enclose 
the entire \f2limited_regular_expression\f1
in single quotes \f4\&\|\(fm\f1 . . . \f4\(fm\f1.
.PP
If no files are specified, \f4grep\fP assumes standard input.
Normally, each line found is copied to standard output.
The filename is printed before each line found if there is more than one input file.
.PP
Command line options are:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP 6
\f4\-b\f1
Precede each line by the block number on which it was found.
This can be useful in locating block numbers by context (first block is 0).
.TP
\f4\-c\f1
Print only a count of the lines that contain the pattern.
.TP
\f4\-e\f2 special_expression\^\f1
Search for a
.I "special_expression\^"
.RI ( "full_regular_expression\^"
that begins with a
\f4\-\f1).
.TP
\f4\-f\f2 file\^\f1
Take the list of
.I full_regular_expressions\^
from 
.IR file .
.TP
\f4\-i\f1
Ignore uppercase/lowercase distinction during comparisons.
.TP
\f4\-h\f1
Prevents the name of the file containing the matching line from being appended
to that line.  Used when searching multiple files.
.TP
\f4\-l\f1
Print the names of files with matching lines once,
separated by newlines.
Does not repeat the names of files when the pattern is found more than once.
.TP
\f4\-n\f1
Precede each line by its line number in the file (first line is 1).
.TP
\f4\-s\f1
Suppress error messages about nonexistent or unreadable files
.TP
\f4\-v\f1
Print all lines except those that contain the pattern.
.PD
.SH SEE ALSO
\f4ed\fP(1),
\f4egrep\fP(1),
\f4fgrep\fP(1),
\f4sed\fP(1),
\f4sh\fP(1).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Exit status is 0 if any matches are found,
1 if none, 2 for syntax errors or inaccessible files
(even if matches were found).
.SH NOTES
Lines are limited to \f4BUFSIZ\f1 characters;
longer lines are truncated.
\f4BUFSIZ\fP is defined in \f4/usr/include/stdio.h\f1.
.br
If there is a line with embedded nulls,
\f4grep\fP will only match up to the first null;
if it matches, it will print the entire line.

.SH DESCRIPTION
If no argument is given,
or if the argument begins with \f4+\f1,
the current date and time are printed.
Otherwise, the current date is set
(only by super-user).
.PP
.TP 12
\f4\-a\f1 [ \f4\-\f1 ] \f2sss\f4.\f2fff\f1
Slowly adjust the time by
.IR sss . fff
seconds
.RI ( fff
represents fractions of a second).
This adjustment can be positive or negative.
The system's clock will be sped up or slowed down until it has drifted
by the number of seconds specified.
.TP
\f4\-u\f1
Display (or set) the date in Greenwich Mean Time
(\s-1GMT\s0\(emuniversal time),
bypassing the normal conversion to
(or from) local time.
.TP
.I mm\^
is the month number
.TP
.I dd\^
is the day number in the month
.TP
.I HH\^
is the hour number (24 hour system)
.TP
.I MM\^
is the minute number
.TP
.I cc\^
is the century minus one
.TP
.I yy\^
is the last 2 digits of the year number
.IP
The month, day, year, and century may be omitted;
the current values are supplied as defaults.
For example:
.IP
.RS
	\f4date\| 10080045\fP
.RE
.IP
sets the date to Oct 8, 12:45 \s-1AM\s+1.
The current year is the default because no year is supplied.
The system operates in \s-1GMT\s0.
\f4date\fP
takes care of the conversion to and from
local standard and daylight time.
Only the super-user may change the date.
After successfully setting the date and time,
\f4date\fP
displays the new date according
to the default format.
The \f4date\fP
command uses
\f4TZ\fP
to determine the correct time zone information
(see
\f4environ\fP(5)).
.TP
\f4+\fP \f2format\fP
If the argument begins with \f4+\fP,
the output of
\f4date\fP
is under the control of the user.
Each Field Descriptor, described below, is preceded by \f4%\fP
and is replaced in the output by
its corresponding value.
A single \f4%\fP is encoded by \f4%%\fP.
All other
characters are copied to the output without change.
The string is always terminated with a new-line character.
If the argument contains embedded blanks
it must be quoted (see the
\s-1EXAMPLE\s0
section).
.PP
Specifications of native language translations of
month and weekday names are supported.
The month and weekday names used for a language are based
on the locale specified by the environment variables
\f4LC_TIME\f1
and
\f4LANG\f1
(see
\f4environ\fP(5)).
.PP
The month and weekday names used for a language are taken
from a file whose format is specified
in
\f4strftime\fP(4).
This file also defines country-specific date and
time formats such as \f4%c\fP,
which specifies the default date format.
The following form is the default for \f4%c\fP:
.RS
.nf
	\f4%a %b %e %T %Z %Y\fP
	e.g., Fri Dec 23 10:10:42 EST 1988

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PD 0
.TP 18
\f5No permission\f1
You are not the super-user and you try to change the date.
.TP
\f5bad conversion\f1
The date set is syntactically incorrect.
.PD
.SH NOTES
Should you need to change the date while the system is
running multi-user, use the
\f4datetime\f1
command of
\f4sysadm\f1(1M).
.P
If you attempt to set the current date to one of the dates that the standard and
alternate time zones change
(for example, the date that daylight time is starting or ending),
and you attempt to set the time to a time in the interval
between the end of standard time and the beginning of the alternate time
(or the end of the alternate time and the beginning of standard time),
the results are unpredictable.

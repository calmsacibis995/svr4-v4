.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4sed\f1
[\f4\-n\f1]
[\f4\-e\f1
\f2script\fP]
[\f4\-f\f1
.IR sfile ]
.RI [ "file .\|.\|." ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4sed\fP
copies the named
.I file\^
(standard input default) to the standard output,
edited according to a script of commands.
The
\f4\-f\f1
option causes the script to be taken from file
.IR sfile ;
these options accumulate.
If there is just one
\f4\-e\f1
option and no
\f4\-f\f1
options,
the flag
\f4\-e\f1
may be omitted.
The
\f4\-n\f1
option suppresses the default output.
A script consists of editing commands, one per line,
of the following form:
.PP
.RS
\f4[ \|\f2address\fP \|[ \|, \|\f2address\fP \|] \|] \|\f2function\fP \|[ \|\f2arguments\fP \|]\f1
.RE
.PP
In normal operation,
\f4sed\fP
cyclically copies a line of input into a
.I pattern space\^
(unless there is something left after
a
\f4D\f1
command),
applies in sequence
all commands whose
.I addresses\^
select that pattern space,
and at the end of the script copies the pattern space
to the standard output (except under
\f4\-n\f1)
and deletes the pattern space.
.PP
Some of the commands use a
.I hold space\^
to save all or part of the
.I pattern space\^
for subsequent retrieval.
.PP
An
.I address\^
is either a decimal number that counts
input lines cumulatively across files, a
\f4$\f1
that
addresses the last line of input, or a context address,
i.e.,
a
\f4/\f2regular expression\f4/\f1
in the style of
\f4ed\fP(1)
modified thus:
.PP
.PD 0
.RS
.HP
In a context address, the construction
\f4\e\fP\f2?regular expression?\^\fP,
where
.IR ?
is any character,
is identical to
\f4/\f2regular expression\f4/\f1.\fP\f1
Note that in the context address
\f4\exabc\exdefx\f1,
the second
\f4x\f1
stands for itself, so that the
regular expression is
\f4abcxdef\f1.
.HP
The escape sequence
\f4\en\f1
matches a
new-line
.I embedded\^
in the pattern space.
.HP
A period \f4(\|.\|)\f1
matches any character except the
.I terminal\^
new-line of the pattern space.
.HP
A command line with no addresses selects every pattern space.
.HP
A command line with
one address selects each pattern space that matches the address.
.HP
A command line with
two addresses selects the inclusive range from the first
pattern space that matches the first address through
the next pattern space that matches
the second address.
(If the second address is a number less than or equal
to the line number selected by the first address,
only the line corresponding to the
first address is selected.)
Thereafter the process is repeated, looking again for the
first address.

Editing commands can be applied only to non-selected pattern
spaces by use of the negation function
\f4!\f1
(below).
.PP
In the following list of functions the
maximum number of permissible addresses
for each function is indicated in parentheses.
.PP
The
.I text\^
argument
consists of one or more lines,
all but the last of which end with
\f4\e\f1
to hide the
new-line.
Backslashes in text are treated like backslashes
in the replacement string of an
\f4s\f1
command,
and may be used to protect initial blanks and tabs
against the stripping that is done on
every script line.
The
.I rfile\^
or
.I wfile\^
argument
must terminate the command
line and must be preceded by exactly one blank.
Each
.I wfile\^
is created before processing begins.
There can be at most 10 distinct
.I wfile\^
arguments.

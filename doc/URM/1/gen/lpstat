.SH NAME
\f4lpstat\f1 \- print information about the status of the \s-1LP\s+1 print service
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4lpstat\f1 [\f2\|options\|\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4lpstat\fP command 
prints information about the current status of 
the \s-1LP\s+1 print service.
.PP
If no options are given,
then \f4lpstat\f1
prints the status of all the user's print
requests made by \f4lp\f1
[see \f4lp\f1(1)].
Any arguments that are not \f2options\f1
are assumed to be \f2request-IDs\f1
as returned by \f4lp\f1.
The \f4lpstat\f1 command 
prints the status of such requests.
The \f2options\f1 may appear in any order
and may be repeated
and intermixed with other arguments.
Some of the keyletters below
may be followed by an optional
.I list
that can be in one of two forms:
a list of items separated from one another by a comma,
or a list of items separated
from one another by spaces
enclosed in quotes.
For example:
.PP
.RS
\f4\-u "user1, user2, user3"\f1
.RE
.PP
Specifying \f4all\f1 after any keyletter
that takes \f2list\f1 as an argument causes
all information relevant to the keyletter to be printed.
For example, the command
.PP
.RS
\f4lpstat \-o all\f1
.RE
.PP
prints the status of all output requests.
.PP
The omission of a \f2list\f1
following such key letters causes all information
relevant to the key letter to be prined.
For example, the command
.PP
.RS
\f4lpstat \-o\f1
.RE
.PP
prints the status of all output requests.
.TP .5i
\f4\-a\f1 [\f2list\f1]
Reports whether print destinations are accepting requests.
.I list
is a list of intermixed printer names and class names.
.TP .5i
\f4\-c\f1 [\f2list\f1]
Reports name of all classes and their members.
.I list
is a list of class names.
.TP
\f4\-d\f1
Reports the system default destination for
output requests.
.TP .5i
\f4\-f \f1[\f2list\f1] [\f4\-l\f1]
Prints a verification that the
forms in \f2list\f1 are recognized by the LP
print service.
\f2list\f1 is a list of forms; the default is \f4all\f1.
The \f4\-l\f1 option will list the form descriptions.
.TP
\f4\-o\f1 [\f2list\f1]
Reports the status of output requests:
.I list
is a list of intermixed
printer names, class names, and
\f2request-IDs\f1.
The keyletter \f4\-o\fP may be omitted.
.TP
\f4\-p\f1 [\f2list\f1] [\f4\-D\f1] [\f4\-l\f1]
Reports the status of printers.
\f2list\f1 is a list of printer names.
If the \f4\-D\f1 option is given, a brief description is
printed for each printer in \f2list\f1.
If the \f4\-l\f1 option is given,
and the printer is
on the local machine,
a full description of each printer's configuration 
is given, including the form mounted, the acceptable
content and printer types, a printer description,
the interface used, and so on.
If the \f4\-l\f1 option is given
and the printer is
remote,
the only information given is the remote
machine and printer names, and the shell-commands
used for file transfer and remote execution.
.TP
\f4\-r\f1
Reports whether the LP request scheduler is on or off.
.TP
\f4\-R\f1
Reports a number showing the position of the job in the print queue.
.TP
\f4\-s\f1
Displays a status summary,
including the status of the LP scheduler,
the system default destination,
a list of class names and their members,
a list of printers and their associated devices,
a list of the machines sharing print services,
a list of all forms currently mounted, 
and a list of all recognized character sets and print wheels.
.TP
\f4\-S [\f2list\f1] [\f4\-l\f1]
Prints a verification that the character sets or the
print wheels specified in \f2list\f1 are recognized by
the LP print service.
Items in \f2list\f1 can be character sets or print wheels;
the default for the list is \f4all\f1.
If the \f4\-l\f1 option is given, 
each line is appended by a list of
printers that can handle the print wheel or
character set.
The list also shows whether 
the print wheel or character set 
is mounted or specifies the built-in character set into which it maps.
.TP
\f4\-t\f1
Displays all status information: all the information
obtained with the \f4\-s\f1 option,
plus the acceptance and idle/busy status of all printers.
.TP
\f4\-u\f1 [\f2login-ID-list\f1] 
Displays the status of output requests for users.
The \f2login-\s-1ID\s+1-list\f1 argument
may include any or all of the following constructs: 
.RS .5i
.TP 1.5i
\f2login-ID\f1
a user on any system
.TP
\f2system_name\f4!\f2login-ID\f1

.SH NAME
\f4chgrp\f1 \- change the group ownership of a file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4chgrp\fP [\f4\-R\fP] [\f4\-h\fP]\f2 group file \f1...
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4chgrp\f1
changes the group
.SM ID
of the
.IR files
given as arguments to
\f2group\fP.
The group may be either a decimal group
.SM ID 
or a group name found in the group
.SM ID
file, 
\f4/etc/group\f1.
.P
You must be the owner of the
file,
or be the super-user to use this command.
.P
The operating system has a configuration option
{\f4_POSIX_CHOWN_RESTRICTED\fP}, to restrict ownership changes.
When this option is in effect, the owner of the file
may change the group of the file only to a group to which
the owner belongs.
Only the super-user can arbitrarily change owner \f4ID\fPs whether this option is in effect or not.
.P
\f4chgrp\fP has one option:
.TP
\f4\-R\f1
Recursive.
\f4chgrp\f1
descends through the directory, and any subdirectories,
setting the specified group
.SM ID
as it proceeds.
When symbolic links are encountered,
they are traversed.
.TP
\f4\-h\fP
If the file is a symbolic link, change the group
of the symbolic link.
Without this option, the group of the file referenced
by the symbolic link is changed.

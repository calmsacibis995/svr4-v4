.SH NAME
\f4makekey\f1 \- generate encryption key
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/usr/lib/makekey\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4makekey\fP
improves the usefulness of encryption schemes
depending on a key by increasing the amount of time required to
search the key space.
It attempts to read 8 bytes for its
.IR key
(the first eight input bytes), then it attempts to
read 2 bytes for its
.IR salt
(the last two input bytes).
The output depends on the input in a way intended
to be difficult to compute (that is, to require a substantial
fraction of a second).
.PP
The first eight input bytes
(the
.IR "input key" )
can be arbitrary
.SM ASCII
characters.
The last
two (the
.IR salt )
are best chosen from the set of digits,
\f4\&.\f1,
\f4/\f1,
and
upper- and lower-case
letters.
The salt characters are repeated as the first two characters of the output.
The remaining 11 output characters are chosen from the same set as the salt
and constitute the
.IR "output key" .
.PP
The transformation performed is essentially the following:
the salt is used to select one of 4,096 cryptographic
machines all based on the National Bureau of Standards
.SM DES
algorithm, but broken in 4,096 different ways.
Using the
.I input key\^
as key,
a constant string is fed into the machine and recirculated
a number of times.
The 64 bits that come out are distributed into the 66
.I output key\^
bits in the result.
.PP
\f4makekey\fP
is intended for programs that perform encryption.
Usually, its input and output will be pipes.

.SH NOTES
\f4makekey\fP
can produce different results depending upon whether the input is
typed at the terminal or redirected from a file.
.PP
This command is provided with the Encryption Utilities,
which is only available in the United States.

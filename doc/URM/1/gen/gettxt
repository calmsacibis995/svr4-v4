to retrieve
\f2msgnum\fP.
The name
can be up to 14 characters in length,

(slash) or
\f4:\f1
(colon).
.TP 10
\f2msgnum\fP
Sequence number of the string to retrieve from
.IR msgfile\fP.
The strings in
\f2msgfile\fP
are numbered sequentially from
1
to 
\f2n\fP,
where
\f2n\fP
is the number of strings in the file.
.TP 10
\f2dflt_msg\fP
Default string to be displayed if
\f4gettxt\f1 fails to retrieve
\f2msgnum\fP
from
\f2msgfile\fP.
Nongraphic characters must be represented
as alphabetic escape sequences.
.PP
The text string to be retrieved is in the file
\f2msgfile\fP,
created by the
\f4mkmsgs\fP(1)
utility and installed under the directory
\f4/usr/lib/locale/\f2locale\f4/LC_MESSAGES\f1.
You control which directory is searched by setting the environment variable
\f4LC_MESSAGES\f1.
If 
\f4LC_MESSAGES\f1
is not set,
the environment variable
\f4LANG\f1
will be used.
If
\f4LANG\f1
is not set,
the files containing the strings are
under the directory
\f4/usr/lib/locale/C/LC_MESSAGES\f1.

If
\f4gettxt\fP
fails to retrieve a message in the requested language,
it will try to retrieve the same message from 
\f4/usr/lib/locale/C/LC_MESSAGES/\f2msgfile\f1.
If this also fails, and if
\f2dflt_msg\fP
is present and non-empty,
then it will display the value of
\f2dflt_msg\fP;
if
\f2dflt_msg\fP
is not present or is empty, then
it will display the string
\f4Message not found!!\en\f1.

\f4LANG\f1
or

have not been set to
other than their default values,

will try to retrieve the 10th message from
\f4/usr/lib/locale/C/LC_MESSAGES/UX\fP.

the message
"hello world,"
followed by a new-line, will be displayed.

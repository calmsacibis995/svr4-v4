.SH NAME
\f4vacation\f1 \- automatically respond to incoming mail messages
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4vacation\fP
[\f4\-l\fP \f2logfile\fP]
[\f4\-m\fP \f2mailfile\fP]
[\f4\-M\fP \f2canned_msg_file\fP]
[\f4\-F\fP \f2failsafe\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
When a new mail message arrives,
the \f4mail\fP command first checks if the recipient's mailbox indicates
that the message is to be forwarded elsewhere (to some other recipient or
as the input to some command).
\f4vacation\fP is used to set up forwarding on the user's mailbox so that
the new message is saved into an alternative mailbox and
a canned response is sent to the message's originator.
.PP
Command-line options are:
.PP
.TP 12
\f4\-l\f2\0logfile\f1
.PD 0

response.
If not specified, it defaults to \f4$HOME/.maillog\fP.
.TP
\f4\-m\f2\0mailfile\f1
Alternate mailbox to save new messages into.
If not specified, it defaults to \f4$HOME/.mailfile\fP.
.TP
\f4\-M\f2\0canned_msg_file\f1

.SH NOTES
Because \f4vacation\fP uses the ``\f4Forward to \(bv\f2command\f1'' facility of
\f4mail\fP to implement notifications,
\f4/var/mail/\f2username\f1 should \f4not\fP be specified as the place
to put newly arrived messages via the \f4\-m\fP invocation option.
The \f4mail\fP command uses
\f4/var/mail/\f2username\f1 to hold either mail messages,
\f4or\fP indications of mail forwarding,
but not both simultaneously.

.SH NAME
\f4intro\fP \- introduction to DMA data structures
.SH SYNOPSIS

#include <sys/dma.h>

.SH DESCRIPTION
This section describes the data structures available for use by device drivers
that directly program DMA controllers.
Intel 80x86-based implementations that support
DMA by having drivers directly program DMA controllers define these structures
in \f4sys/dma.h\fP.
.P
Driver developers should not declare arrays
of these structures, as the size of any structure might change between releases.
Drivers can only reference those structure members described on the manual
page.
The actual data structures may have additional structure members beyond those described,
but drivers must not reference them.

.SH NAME
\f4queue\fP \- STREAMS queue structure
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\f4#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stream.h>\fP
.ad
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
A instance of a STREAMS driver or module consists of two
\f4queue\fP structures, one for upstream (read-side) processing
and one for downstream (write-side) processing.
This structure is the major building block of a stream.
It contains pointers to the processing procedures, pointers to the
next queue in the stream, flow control parameters, and
a list of messages to be processed.

.P
The \f4q_qinfo\fP field contains a pointer to the \f4qinit\fP(D4DK)
structure specifying the processing routines and default values for
the queue.
This field should not be changed by drivers or modules.
.P
The \f4q_first\fP field points to the first message on the queue, or
is \f4NULL\fP if the queue is empty.
This field should not be changed
by drivers or modules.
.P
The \f4q_last\fP field points to the last message on the queue, or
is \f4NULL\fP if the queue is empty.
This field should not be changed
by drivers or modules.
.P
The \f4q_next\fP field points to the next queue in the stream.
This
field should not be changed by drivers or modules.
.P
The \f4q_ptr\fP field is a private field for use by drivers and modules.
It provides a way to associate the driver's per-minor data structure with
the queue.
.P
The \f4q_count\fP field contains the number of bytes in messages on the
queue in priority band 0.
This includes normal messages and high priority
messages.
.P
The \f4q_flag\fP field contains a bitmask of flags that indicate
different queue characteristics.
No flags may be set or cleared
by drivers or modules.
However, the following flags may be tested:
.IP \f4QREADR\fP 14n
The queue is the read queue.
Absence of this flag implies
a write queue.
.P
The \f4q_minpsz\fP field is the minimum packet size for
the queue.
This is an advisory limit specifying
the smallest message that can be accepted by the queue.
It is initially set to the value specified by the \f4mi_minpsz\fP
field in the \f4module_info\fP(D4DK) structure.
This field
can be changed by drivers or modules.
.P
The \f4q_maxpsz\fP field is the maximum packet size for
the queue.
This is an advisory limit specifying
the largest message that can be accepted by the queue.
It is initially set to the value specified by the \f4mi_maxpsz\fP
field in the \f4module_info\fP structure.
This field
can be changed by drivers or modules.
.P
The \f4q_hiwat\fP field is the high water mark for the
queue.
This specifies the number of bytes of
data contained in messages on the queue such that the queue is
considered full, and hence flow-controlled.
It is initially set to the value specified by the \f4mi_hiwat\fP
field in the \f4module_info\fP structure.
This field
can be changed by drivers or modules.
.P
The \f4q_lowat\fP field is the low water mark for the
queue.
This specifies the number of bytes of
data contained in messages on the queue such that the queue is
no longer flow-controlled.
It is initially set to the value specified by the \f4mi_lowat\fP
field in the \f4module_info\fP structure.
This field
can be changed by drivers or modules.
.SH NOTES
The \f4queue\fP structure is defined as type \f4queue_t\fP.

.SH NAME
\f4streamtab\fP \- STREAMS driver and module declaration structure
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4#include <sys/stream.h>\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
Each STREAMS driver or module must have a
\f4streamtab\fP structure.
The streamtab structure must be named
\f2prefix\f4info\f1, where \f2prefix\fP is the driver
prefix.
.P
The \f4streamtab\fP structure is made up of pointers to \f4qinit\fP
structures for both the read and
write queue portions of each module or driver.
(Multiplexing drivers require both upper and lower
\f4qinit\fP structures.)
The \f4qinit\fP structure
contains the entry points through
which the module or driver routines are called.

.P
The \f4st_rdinit\fP field contains a pointer to the read-side \f4qinit\fP
structure.
For a multiplexing driver, this is the \f4qinit\fP structure
for the upper read side.
.P
The \f4st_wrinit\fP field contains a pointer to the write-side \f4qinit\fP
structure.
For a multiplexing driver, this is the \f4qinit\fP structure
for the upper write side.
.P
The \f4st_muxrinit\fP field contains a pointer to the lower read-side
\f4qinit\fP structure for multiplexing drivers.
For modules and
non-multiplexing drivers, this field should be set to \f4NULL\fP.
.P
The \f4st_muxwinit\fP field contains a pointer to the lower write-side
\f4qinit\fP structure for multiplexing drivers.
For modules and
non-multiplexing drivers, this field should be set to \f4NULL\fP.

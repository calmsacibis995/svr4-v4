.SH NAME
\f4copyreq\fP \- STREAMS transparent \f4ioctl\fP copy request structure
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4#include <sys/stream.h>\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4copyreq\fP structure contains the information necessary to process
transparent \f4ioctl\fPs.
It is used in \f4M_COPYIN\fP and \f4M_COPYOUT\fP messages.
The module or driver usually converts an \f4M_IOCTL\fP or
\f4M_IOCDATA\fP message
into an \f4M_COPYIN\fP or \f4M_COPYOUT\fP message.
The \f4copyreq\fP structure
is thus overlaid on top of the \f4iocblk\fP(D4DK) or \f4copyresp\fP(D4DK) structure.
The stream head guarantees that the message is large enough
to contain the different structures.

.P
The \f4cq_cmd\fP field is the \f4ioctl\fP command, copied from the \f4ioc_cmd\fP field
of the \f4iocblk\fP structure.
If the same message is used, then the \f4cq_cmd\fP
field directly overlays the \f4ioc_cmd\fP field (that is, it need not be copied.)
.P
The \f4cq_cr\fP field contains a pointer to the user credentials.
It is copied from
the \f4ioc_cr\fP field of the \f4iocblk\fP structure.
If the same message is used,
then the \f4cq_cr\fP field directly overlays the \f4ioc_cr\fP field
(that is, it need not
be copied.)
.P
The \f4cq_id\fP field is the \f4ioctl\fP ID, copied from the \f4ioc_id\fP field
of the \f4iocblk\fP structure.
It is used to uniquely identify the \f4ioctl\fP
request in the stream.
If the same message is used, then the \f4cq_id\fP
field directly overlays the \f4ioc_id\fP field (that is, it need not be copied.)
.P
For an \f4M_COPYIN\fP message, the \f4cq_addr\fP field contains the user address
from which the data are to be copied.
For an \f4M_COPYOUT\fP message, the \f4cq_addr\fP
field contains the user address to which the data are to be copied.
In both cases, the \f4cq_size\fP field contains the number of bytes to copy.
.P
The \f4cq_flag\fP field is reserved for future use and should be set to 0 by the
module or driver.
.P
The \f4cq_private\fP field is a field set aside for use by the driver.
It can be used
to hold whatever state information is necessary to process the \f4ioctl\fP.
It is copied to the \f4cp_private\fP field in the resultant \f4M_IOCDATA\fP message.
.SH NOTES
When the \f4M_COPYIN\fP or \f4M_COPYOUT\fP message is freed, any message that \f4cq_private\fP
refers to is not freed by the STREAMS subsystem.
It is the responsibility
of the module or driver to free it.

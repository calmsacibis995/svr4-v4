.SH DESCRIPTION
The service routine may be included in a STREAMS module or driver for 
a number of reasons.  It provides greater control over the flow of
messages in a stream by allowing the module or driver to reorder messages,
defer the processing of some messages, or fragment and reassemble messages.
Service routines also provide a way to recover from resource allocation failures.  
.P
A message is first passed to a module's or driver's
\f4put\fP(D2DK) routine, which may or may not process it.  The \f4put\fP routine
can place the message on the queue for processing by the service routine.
.P
Once a message has been enqueued, the STREAMS scheduler 
calls the service routine at some later time.  Drivers and modules should not depend
on the order in which service procedures are run.  This is an implementation-dependent
characteristic.  In particular, applications should not rely on service procedures running
before returning to user-level processing.
.P
Every STREAMS queue [see \f4queue\fP(D4DK)] has limit
values it uses to implement flow control.
Tunable high and low water marks are checked to stop and restart
the flow of message processing.
Flow control limits apply only between two adjacent queues
with service routines.  Flow control occurs by service routines following
certain rules before passing messages along.  By convention, high priority
messages are not affected by flow control.
.P
STREAMS messages can be defined to have up to 256 different
priorities to support some networking protocol requirements
for multiple bands of data flow.
At a minimum, a stream must distinguish between normal (priority band
zero) messages and high priority messages (such as \f4M_IOCACK\fP).
High priority messages are always placed at the head of the
queue, after any other high priority messages already enqueued.
Next are messages from all included priority bands, which are
enqueued in decreasing order of priority.
Each priority band has its own flow control limits.
By convention, if
a band is flow-controlled, all lower priority bands are
also stopped.
.P
Once a service routine is called by the STREAMS scheduler it must
process all messages on its queue, until either the queue is empty,
the stream is flow-controlled, or an allocation error occurs.
Typically, the service routine will switch on the message type, which
is contained in \f4mp->b_datap->db_type\fP, taking different actions
depending on the message type.
The framework for the canonical service procedure algorithm is as follows:
.sp 0.5
.nf
\f4	queue_t *q;
	mblk_t *mp;

	while ((mp = getq(q)) != NULL) {
		if (pcmsg(mp->b_datap->db_type) ||
		   canput(q->q_next)) {
			/* process the message */
			putnext(q, mp);
		} else {
			putbq(q, mp);
			return;
		}
	}\fP
.fi
.sp 0.5
If the module or driver cares about priority bands, the algorithm becomes:
.sp 0.5
.nf
\f4	queue_t *q;
	mblk_t *mp;

	while ((mp = getq(q)) != NULL) {
		if (pcmsg(mp->b_datap->db_type) ||
		   bcanput(q->q_next, mp->b_band)) {
			/* process the message */
			putnext(q, mp);
		} else {
			putbq(q, mp);
			return;
		}
	}\fP
.fi
.sp 0.5
.SH NOTES
This entry point is optional.
.sp 0.5
Each STREAMS module and driver can have a read and write service routine.
If a service routine is not needed (because the \f4put\fP routine
processes all messages), a \f4NULL\fP pointer should be placed
in module's \f4qinit\fP(D4DK) structure.
.sp 0.5
If the service routine finishes running because of any reason other than
flow control or an empty queue, then it must explicitly arrange for its
rescheduling.  For example, if
an allocation error occurs during the processing of a message, the
service routine can put the message back on the queue with \f4putbq\fP, and,
before returning, arrange to have itself
rescheduled [see \f4qenable\fP(D3DK)] at some later time [see \f4bufcall\fP(D3DK)
and \f4timeout\fP(D3DK)].
.sp 0.5
Service routines do not have user context and so may not call
any function that sleeps.
.sp 0.5
Service routines can be interrupted by \f4put\fP routines, unless the processor
level is raised.
.sp 0.5
Drivers and modules should not call service routines directly.  \f4qenable\fP(D3DK)
should be used to schedule service routines to run.
.sp 0.5
Drivers should free any messages they do not recognize.
.sp 0.5
Modules should pass on any messages they do not recognize.
.sp 0.5
Drivers should fail any unrecognized \f4M_IOCTL\fP messages by converting them into
\f4M_IOCNAK\fP messages and sending them upstream.
.sp 0.5
Modules should pass on any unrecognized \f4M_IOCTL\fP messages.
.sp 0.5
Service routines should never put high priority messages back on their queues.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Ignored.

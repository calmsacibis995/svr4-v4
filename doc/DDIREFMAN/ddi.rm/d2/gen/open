.TP .6i
\f2devp\fP
Pointer to a device number.

\f2oflag\fP
Information passed from the user
that instructs the driver on
how to open the file.  The bit settings for the flag are found in
\f4file.h\fP.  Valid settings are:
.RS .6i
.TP .75i
\f4FEXCL\fP
Interpreted in a driver-dependent manner.  Some drivers interpret this flag
to mean open the device with exclusive access (fail all other attempts to open
the device.)
.TP
\f4FNDELAY\fP
Open the device and return immediately without sleeping (do not block
the open even if there is a problem.) 
.TP
\f4FNONBLOCK\fP
Open the device and return immediately without sleeping (do not block
the open even if there is a problem.) 
.TP
\f4FREAD\fP
Open the device with read access permission.
.TP
\f4FWRITE\fP
Open the device with write access permission.
.RE
.TP .6i
\f2otyp\fP
Parameter supplied so that the driver can determine how many
times a device was opened and for what reasons.
All flags are defined in \f4open.h\fP.  The values are
mutually exclusive.

\f4OTYP_BLK\fP
Open occurred through block interface for the device.

\f4OTYP_CHR\fP
Open occurred through the raw/character interface for the device.

Open a layered device.
This flag is used when one driver
calls another driver's \f4open\fP routine.

\f2q\fP
Pointer to the queue used to reference the

\f2devp\fP
Pointer to a device number.  For modules, \f2devp\fP always points to the
device number associated with the driver at the end (tail) of the stream.

Open flags.  Valid values are the same as those listed above.

STREAMS flag.  Values are mutually exclusive and are given as follows:
.P
.RS .6i
.TP .75i
\f4CLONEOPEN\fP
Indicates a clone open (see below.)
If the driver supports cloning, it must assign and 
return a device number of an unused device by changing the value of the device number
to which \f2devp\fP points.
.TP
\f4MODOPEN\fP
Indicates that an \f4open\fP routine is being called
for a module, not a driver.  This is useful in detecting
configuration errors and in determining how the driver is
being used, since STREAMS drivers can also be configured
as STREAMS modules.
.TP
0
Indicates a driver is being opened directly, without cloning.
.RE
.TP .6i
\f2crp\fP
Pointer to the user credential structure.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The driver's \f4open\fP routine is called to prepare a device for further
access.  It is called by the kernel during an \f4open\fP(2)
or a \f4mount\fP(2) of the device special file.  For non-STREAMS drivers,
it can also be called
from another (layered) driver.  The STREAMS module \f4open\fP
routine is called by the kernel during an \f4I_PUSH ioctl\fP(2) or an autopush-style
open [see \f4autopush\fP(1M)].
.P
The \f4open\fP routine could perform any of the following general
functions, depending on the type of device and the service provided:
.P
.PD 0.2v
.IP
enable interrupts
.IP
allocate buffers or other resources needed to use the device
.IP
lock an unsharable device
.IP
notify the device of the open
.IP
change the device number if this is a clone open
.PD
.P
The \f4open\fP routine should verify that the minor number component of
\f2devp\fP is valid, that the type of access requested by \f2otyp\fP
and \f2oflag\fP is appropriate for the device, and, if required,
check permissions using the user credentials pointed to by \f2crp\fP [see \f4drv_priv\fP(D3DK)].
.P
For STREAMS drivers and modules, the \f4open\fP routine is called with
interrupts blocked from all STREAMS devices.  If the driver sets stream head
options by sending an \f4M_SETOPTS\fP message upstream from the \f4open\fP routine,
then the changes are guaranteed to take effect when the system call completes.
.P
Cloning is the process of the driver selecting an unused device for
the user.  It eliminates the need to poll many devices when looking for an
unused one.
Both STREAMS and Non-STREAMS drivers may implement cloning
behavior by changing the device number pointed to by \f2devp\fP.
A driver may designate certain minor devices as special clone entry points
into the driver.  When these are opened, the driver searches for an
unused device and returns the new device number by changing the value
of the device number to which \f2devp\fP points.  Both the major device number
and the minor device number can be changed, although usually just the minor number
is changed.  The major number is only changed when the clone controls more than
one device.
.P
Using this method of cloning, a STREAMS driver will never see \f2sflag\fP set
to \f4CLONEOPEN\fP.
A different method makes use of this flag.
STREAMS drivers can take advantage of a special driver, known as the
\f2clone driver\fP, to perform clone opens.  This frees the driver from having to
reserve special minors for the clone entry points.  Here, the device node is
actually that of the clone driver (the major number is the major number from the
clone driver and the minor number is the major number from the real driver.)
When the clone driver is opened, it will call the real driver
open routine with \f2sflag\fP set to \f4CLONEOPEN\fP.
.SH NOTES
This entry point is required in all drivers.
.sp 0.5
The \f4open\fP routine has user context and can sleep.  However, STREAMS drivers
and modules must sleep such that signals do not cause the sleep
to longjump [see \f4sleep\fP(D3K)].
.sp 0.5
Support of cloning is optional.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \f4open\fP routine should return 0 for success,
or the appropriate error number.

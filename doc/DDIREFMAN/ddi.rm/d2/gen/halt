.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \f4halt\fP routine if present, is called when the system is shut down.
The device driver shouldn't assume that the interrupts are enabled.
The driver should make sure that no interrupts are
pending from its device, and inform the device that no more interrupts
should be generated.
After the \f4halt\fP routine is called, no more
calls will be made to the driver entry points.
.SH NOTES
This entry point is optional.
.sp 0.5
User context is not available, so the driver's \f4halt\fP routine should not sleep.
.SH RETURN VALUE
None.

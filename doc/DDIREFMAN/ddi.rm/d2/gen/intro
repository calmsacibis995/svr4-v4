.SH DESCRIPTION
This section describes the routines a developer needs to include
in a device driver.  These routines are called "entry point
routines" because they provide the interfaces that the kernel needs
from drivers.  The kernel calls them when needed.  Some are called
at well-defined times, such as system start up and system shut down.
Others are called as a result of I/O-related system calls or external
events, such as interrupts from peripheral devices.
.P
Each driver is organized into two logical parts: the base level and
the interrupt level.
The base level interacts with the kernel and the device
on behalf of processes performing
I/O operations.  The interrupt level interacts with the device and
the kernel as a
result of an event such as data arrival, and usually cannot be associated with
any particular process.
.P
Each driver is uniquely identified by a prefix string specified in its
configuration file.
The name of all the driver-supplied routines and global variables
should begin with this prefix.  This will reduce the chance of a symbol collision
with another driver.  Any private routines defined by a driver that are not entry point
routines should be declared as \f4static\fP.  Also, any global variables that
are private to the driver should be declared as \f4static\fP.

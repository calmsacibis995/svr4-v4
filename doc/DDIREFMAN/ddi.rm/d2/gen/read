\f2dev\fP
Device number.

\f2uiop\fP

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The driver \f4read\fP routine is called during
the \f4read\fP(2) system call.
The \f4read\fP routine is responsible for transferring data from the device
to the user data area.
The pointer to the user credentials, \f2crp\fP, is available
so the driver can check to see if the user can read privileged
information, if the driver provides access to any.
The \f4uio\fP structure provides the information necessary to determine
how much data should be transferred.
The \f4uiomove\fP(D3DK) function provides
a convenient way to copy data using the \f4uio\fP structure.
.P
Block drivers that provide a character interface can use \f4physiock\fP(D3D) to
perform the data transfer with the driver's \f4strategy\fP(D2DK) routine.
.SH NOTES
This interface is optional.
.sp 0.5
The \f4read\fP routine has user context and can sleep.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \f4read\fP routine should return 0 for success,
or the appropriate error number.

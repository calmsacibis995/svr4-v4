\f2dev\fP
Device number.
.TP
\f2uiop\fP
Pointer to the \f4uio\fP(D4DK) structure that describes where the data
is to be fetched from user space.
.TP
\f2crp\fP
Pointer to the user credential structure for the I/O
transaction.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The driver \f4write\fP routine is called
during the \f4write\fP(2) system call.
The \f4write\fP routine is responsible for transferring data from
the user data area to the device.
The pointer to the user credentials, \f2crp\fP, is available
so the driver can check to see if the user can write privileged
information, if the driver provides access to any.
The \f4uio\fP structure provides the information necessary to determine
how much data should be transferred.
The \f4uiomove\fP(D3DK) function provides
a convenient way to copy data using the \f4uio\fP structure.
.P
Block drivers that provide a character interface can use \f4physiock\fP(D3DK) to
perform the data transfer with the driver's \f4strategy\fP(D2DK) routine.
.P
The write operation is intended to be synchronous from the caller's perspective.
Minimally, the driver \f4write\fP routine should not return until the caller's
buffer is no longer needed.
For drivers that care about returning errors, the data should be committed
to the device.
For others, the data might only be copied to local staging buffers.
Then the data will be committed to the device asynchronous to the user's request,
losing the ability to return an error with the associated request.
.SH NOTES
This interface is optional.
.sp 0.5
The \f4write\fP routine has user context and can sleep.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The \f4write\fP routine should return 0 for success,
or the appropriate error number.

.SH NAME
\f4mps_AMPreceive_frag\f1 \- receives solicited data in fragments when
buffer space is not available at the receiving agent
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\f4#include <sys/mps.h>
long mps_AMPreceive_frag(\f2chan\fP, \f2mbp\fP, \f2socid\fP, \f2tid\fP, \f2ibuf\fP)
long chan;

.fi
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PD 0
.TP
\f2chan\f1
Channel number received from a previous \f4mps_open_chan\f1.
.TP
\f2mbp\f1
Points to a message buffer.
.TP
\f2socid\f1
Identifies socket id of the socket which initiated the transaction.
.TP
\f2tid\f1
Identifies the transaction corresponding to this \f4mps_AMPreceive_frag\f1.
It is obtained from the request message.
.TP
\f2ibuf\f1
Specifies the data buffer to receive incoming data.
Indication of
completion of transfer is sent to \f2intr\f1 via a message.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4mps_AMPreceive_frag\f1 is used when an agent sending solicited data
requests buffer space that is not available at the receiving agent.
After the Buffer Reject message is sent, the receiving agent can use
\f4mps_AMPreceive_frag\f1 to receive the solicited data in fragments
depending on the available buffer space in the receiving agent.
See the \f2Multibus II Transport Protocol Specification and Designer's Guide\f1
for additional information.
.PP
The \f4mps_AMPreceive_frag\f1 routine queues up the message to initiate
the transfer, sets up table entries to receive data messages, and
returns immediately.
This routine is asynchronous in operation.
.PP
Applications must ensure that \f4mps_AMPreceive_frag\f1 is repeatedly used
the correct number of times with the correct fragment buffer length to
transfer an entire request.
.SH RETURN VALUE
If no error is detected, 0 (zero) is returned.
When an error is detected, \-1
is returned.
.SH LEVEL
Base or Interrupt

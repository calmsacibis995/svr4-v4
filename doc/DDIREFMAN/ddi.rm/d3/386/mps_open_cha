.SH NAME
\f4mps_open_chan\f1 \- opens a channel
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\f4#include <sys/mps.h>
long mps_open_chan (\f2portid\fP, \f2intr\fP, \f2priolev\fP)
unsigned short portid;
(void) (*intr() );
unsigned short priolev;\f1
.fi
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP 11
\f2portid\f1
Port ID of a local port.
.TP 11
\f2intr\f1
Pointer to a function that is invoked for every incoming unsolicited message
for the port specified by \f2portid\f1.
A pointer to the message buffer
containing the incoming message buffer is passed to \f4intr\f1 as an
argument.
If \f2intr\f1 is NULL, all incoming unsolicited messages are
discarded and all incoming request messages belonging to a request-response
transaction result in a transaction cancel being sent to the
originating socket.
If the message handler encounters an error on a message
transmission, the function pointed to by \f2intr\f1 is invoked with the
erroneous message as an argument.
If \f2intr\f1 is NULL, all error messages
are ignored.
.TP 11
\f2priolev\f1
Specifies the priority level at which the \f2intr\f1 routines are executed.
\f2priolev\f1 should be set to \f4MPS_SRLPRIO\f1 for serial I/O drivers,
\f4MPS_BLKPRIO\f1 for block I/O drivers, and \f4MPS_NRMPRIO\f1 for all
other uses of the message handler.
These are the only valid values
allowed for \f2priolev\f1.
.SH DESCRIPTION
A call to \f4mps_open_chan\f1 is required before any message operations
can be done on a port.
\f4mps_open_chan\f1 is synchronous in operation.
To open a channel a device driver must identify three parameters:
a port, an interrupt handler routine, and an interrupt priority level, as
described above.
.PP
Message buffers passed to \f2intr\f1 routines are assumed to be allocated
to the handler for that port.
It is the responsibility of the \f2intr\f1
routines to free the message buffers it receives from the message handler.
.SH RETURN VALUE
When \f4mps_open_chan\f1 is successful, a channel number is returned that
is to be used in requests for message services.
When \f4mps_open_chan\f1
fails, -1 is returned.
.SH LEVEL
Base or Interrupt

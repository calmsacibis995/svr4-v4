.SH NAME
\f4mps_AMPsend_rsvp\f1 \- queues request messages for transmission
and sets up table entries for reception of reply messages
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\f4#include <sys/mps.h>
long mps_AMPsend_rsvp(\f2chan\fP, \f2omsg\fP, \f2obuf\fP, \f2ibuf\fP)
long chan;
mps_msgbuf_t *omsg;
struct dma_buf *obuf, *ibuf;\f1
.fi
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PD 0
.TP 11
\f2chan\f1
Channel number received from a previous \f4mps_open_ chan\f1.
.TP 11
\f2omsg\f1
Points to a message buffer containing message to be sent.
.TP 11
\f2obuf\f1
Specifies a data buffer for data to be sent.
.TP 11
\f2ibuf\f1
Specifies a data buffer to receive replies.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4mps_AMPsend_rsvp\f1 queues up request messages for transmission and
sets up table entries for reception of reply messages when they arrive.
This routine is asynchronous in operation.
.PP
When \f2obuf\f1 is NULL, the request message is assumed to be an
unsolicited message.
In this case \f4mps_mk_unsol\f1 (with a non-zero
\f2tid\f1 obtained by a call to \f4mps_get_tid\f1) should be used to build
the message in \f2omsg\f1.
When \f2obuf\f1 is not NULL, request message
is assumed to be a solicited message and \f2obuf\f1 points to the data.
In this case \f4mps_mk_unsol\f1 (with a non-zero \f2tid\f1 obtained by a
call to \f4mps_get_tid\f1) should be used to build the message in \f2omsg\f1.
.PP
When \f2obuf\f1 is not NULL, the request message is assumed to be a solicited
message and \f2obuf\f1 points to the solicited data.
In this
case, \f4mps_mk_sol\f1 (with a non-zero tid obtained by a call to
\f4mps_get_tid\f1) should be used to build the message in \f2omsg\f1.
If \f2ibuf\f1 is NULL, the reply message is expected to be an unsolicited
message.
.SH RETURN VALUE
\f4mps_AMPsend_rsvp\f1 returns 0 (zero) if no error is detected;
otherwise, \-1 is returned.
.SH LEVEL
Base or Interrupt

.SH NAME
\f4mps_AMPsend\f1 \- sends unsolicited messages that are not part of
any request-response transaction
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\f4#include <sys/mps.h>
long mps_AMPsend(\f2chan\fP, \f2mbp\fP)
long chan;
mps_msgbuf_t *mbp;\f1
.fi
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PD 0
.TP 11
\f2chan\f1
Channel number obtained from a previous \f4mps_open_chan\f1 call.
.TP 11
\f2mbp\f1
Points to a message buffer obtained from the message handler.
This message
buffer contains the message to be sent.
The user is expected to have built
the message in \f2mbp\f1 using \f4mps_mk_unsol\f1, \f4mps_mk_breject\f1, or
\f4mps_mk_brdcst\f1 with a zero \f2tid\f1.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4mps_AMPsend\f1 routine is used for unsolicited data transmission that
is not part of any request-response transaction.
This routine is
synchronous in operation.
After a message buffer has been handed over to
the message handler for transmission, it is assumed to be allocated to
the message handler and the sender should not try to access that message
buffer.
.SH RETURN VALUE
When no error is detected, 0 (zero) is returned.
If an error is
encountered, \-1 is returned.
.SH LEVEL
Base or Interrupt

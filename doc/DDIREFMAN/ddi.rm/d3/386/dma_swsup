.SH ARGUMENTS 
.RS 0n 10
.IP "\f2dmacbptr\f1" 10n
Pointer to the DMA command block specifying the DMA operation.
.IP "\f2chan\f1" 10n
DMA channel over which the operation is to take place.
.IP "\f2mode\f1" 10n
Specifies whether the caller is willing to sleep waiting
to allocate desired DMA channel.
If \f2mode\fP is set to \f4DMA_SLEEP\fP, the caller will sleep
if necessary until the requested channel becomes available for its use.
If \f2mode\fP is set to \f4DMA_NOSLEEP\fP, the caller will not sleep,
but \f4dma_swsetup\fP will return \f4FALSE\fP if the requested DMA channel
is not immediately available.

.SH DESCRIPTION 
\f4dma_swsetup\f1 programs the DMA channel \f2chan\fP for the 
operation specified by the DMA command block whose address
is given by \f2dmacbptr\fP.
Note that \f4dma_swsetup\fP does not initiate the DMA transfer.
Instead, the transfer will be initiated by a subsequent
request initiated via software by \f4dma_swstart\fP(D3X).
.P
If \f4dma_swsetup\fP programs the operation successfully,
it then calls the procedure specified by the \f4proc\fP field
of the \f4dma_cb\fP(D4X) structure.
It passes as an argument the
value in the \f4procparms\fP field.
If \f4proc\fP is set to \f4NULL\fP, then no routine is called.
.P
To program the operation, \f4dma_swsetup\fP requires
exclusive use of the specified DMA channel.
The caller may specify, via the \f2mode\fP argument,
whether \f4dma_swsetup\fP should sleep
waiting for a busy channel to become available.
If the specified channel is in use and \f2mode\fP is set to
\f4DMA_SLEEP\fP, then \f4dma_swsetup\fP will sleep until the
channel becomes available for its use.
Otherwise, if \f4DMA_NOSLEEP\fP is specified and
the requested channel is not immediately
available, \f4dma_swsetup\fP will not program the channel,
but will simply return a value of \f4FALSE\fP.
.SH "RETURN VALUE" 
\f4dma_swsetup\f1 returns the value \f4TRUE\fP on success
and returns the value \f4FALSE\fP otherwise.
.SH LEVEL
Base only if either (1) \f2mode\fP is set to \f4DMA_SLEEP\fP
or (2) the routine specified by the \f4proc\fP field
of the \f4dma_cb\fP structure sleeps.
Base or Interrupt otherwise.
.SH NOTES
Can sleep if \f2mode\fP is set to \f4DMA_SLEEP\fP
or if the routine specified by the \f4proc\fP field
of the \f4dma_cb\fP structure sleeps.

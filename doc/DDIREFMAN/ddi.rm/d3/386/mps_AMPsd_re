request-response transaction
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\f4#include <sys/mps.h>
long mps_AMPsend_reply(\f2chan\fP, \f2omsg\fP, \f2obuf\fP)
long chan;
mps_msgbuf_t *omsg;

.SH ARGUMENTS
.PD 0
.TP 11
\f2chan\f1
Channel number received from a previous \f4mps_open_chan\f1.
.TP 11
\f2omsg\f1
Points to a message buffer containing the message to be sent.
The message
in \f2omsg\f1 should be constructed using \f4mps_mk_solrply\f1 or
\f4mps_mk_unsolrply\f1 (depending on whether \f2obuf\f1 is NULL or not)
with the EOT flag set appropriately.
.TP 11
\f2obuf\f1
Points to a data buffer containing data to be sent.
When \f2obuf\f1 is
NULL, the reply message is assumed to be an unsolicited message.
When \f2obuf\f1 is not NULL,
the reply message is assumed to be a solicited message.
A completion indication is sent via a message to the appropriate
\f4intr\f1 routine.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4mps_AMPsend_reply\f1 is used to send a reply in response to a received
request that is part of a request-response transaction.
The \f4mps_AMPsend_reply\f1 routine is asynchronous in operation.
\f4mps_AMPsend_reply\f1 returns immediately, queuing up to send
the reply.
Be sure to use the \f2tid\f1 from the corresponding received
request.
.PP
\f4mps_AMPsend_reply\f1 can be used to send a reply as a number of
solicited fragments.
The message buffer in the last reply fragment should
have the \f2EOT\f1 flag set to 1.
.SH RETURN VALUE
If no error is detected, 0 (zero) is returned; otherwise \-1 is returned.
.SH LEVEL
Base or Interrupt

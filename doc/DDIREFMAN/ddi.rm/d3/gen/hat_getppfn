.SH ARGUMENTS
.RS 0n 10

The physical address for which the physical page ID is
to be returned.
.IP "\f2pspace\fP" 10n
The physical address space to which \f2addr\fP belongs.

.SH DESCRIPTION
This routine can be used to obtain a physical page ID suitable to be used as the
return value of the driver's \f4mmap\fP(D2DK) entry point.
\f4hat_getppfnum\fP returns the physical page ID corresponding to the physical address
\f2addr\fP.  Some systems have multiple physical address spaces (different buses, etc.)
For these systems, \f2pspace\fP indicates the address space to which \f2addr\fP belongs.
For all systems, \f4PSPACE_MAINSTORE\fP is defined as the address space that includes
mainstore system memory.  Other values are implementation-defined.
.P
A physical page ID is a machine-specific token that uniquely identifies a page
of physical memory in the system (either system memory or device memory.)
No assumptions should be made about the format of a physical page ID.
.SH RETURN VALUE
If \f2addr\fP and \f2pspace\fP are valid, the corresponding physical page ID is returned.
Otherwise, \f4NOPAGE\fP is returned.
.SH LEVEL
Base or interrupt.
.SH NOTES
Does not sleep.

.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4putbq\f1 puts a message back at the head of a queue.
If messages of a higher priority are on the queue, then
\f2bp\fP is placed at the head of its corresponding priority
band.  See \f4srv\fP(D2DK) for more information about message
priorities.
.P
All flow control parameters are updated.
The queue's service routine is scheduled if it has not been disabled by a previous call to
\f4noenable\fP(D3DK).
.P
\f4putbq\f1 is usually 
called when \f4bcanput\f1(D3DK) or \f4canput\f1(D3DK) determines that the
message cannot be passed on to the next stream component.
.SH RETURN VALUE
\f4putbq\f1 returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.
.SH LEVEL
Base or Interrupt.
.SH NOTES
Does not sleep.
.sp 0.5
\f4putbq\fP can fail if there is not enough memory to allocate the accounting data
structures used with messages whose priority bands are greater than zero.
.sp 0.5
High priority messages should never be put back on a queue from within a service routine.

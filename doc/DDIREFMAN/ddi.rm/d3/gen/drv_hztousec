The number of clock ticks to convert to equivalent microseconds.

.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4drv_hztousec\f1 converts the length of time expressed by
\f2ticks\f1, which is in units of clock ticks,
into units of microseconds.
.P
Several functions either take time values expressed in clock ticks as
arguments [\f4timeout\f1(D3DK), \f4delay\f1(D3DK)] or return time values
expressed in clock ticks [\f4drv_getparm\f1(D3DK)].
The length of a clock tick can vary across different implementations,
and therefore drivers should not include any hard-coded assumptions
about the length of a tick.
\f4drv_hztousec\f1 and the complementary function
\f4drv_usectohz\f1(D3DK) can be used, as necessary, to convert between clock
ticks and microseconds.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The number of microseconds equivalent to the \f2ticks\f1 argument.
No error value is returned.
If the microsecond equivalent
to \f2ticks\f1 is too large to be represented as a \f4clock_t\f1, then the
maximum \f4clock_t\f1 value will be returned.
.SH LEVEL
Base or Interrupt.
.SH NOTES
Does not sleep.
.sp 0.5
The time value returned by \f4drv_getparm\f1 with an \f4LBOLT\f1 argument
will frequently be too large to represent in microseconds as a \f4clock_t\f1.
When using \f4drv_getparm\f1 together with \f4drv_hztousec\f1 to time
operations, drivers can help avoid overflow by converting the difference
between return values from successive calls to \f4drv_getparm\f1 instead
of trying to convert the return values themselves.

.SH NAME
\f4adjmsg\f1 \- trim bytes from a message 
.IX "STREAMS messages"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf

\f4#include <sys/stream.h>
.sp 0.5
int adjmsg(\f4mblk_t *\f1\f2mp, \f4int\f2 len\f4);\f1

.SH ARGUMENTS
.RS 0n
.IP "\f2mp\f1" 10n
Pointer to the message to be trimmed.
.IP "\f2len\f1" 10n
The number of bytes to be removed.
.RE
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4adjmsg\f1 removes bytes from a message.
|\^\f2len\fP\^| (the absolute value of \f2len\fP) specifies how many bytes
are to be removed.
If \f2len\f1 is greater than \f40\f1, bytes 
are removed from the head of the message.
If \f2len\f1 is less than \f40\f1, 
bytes are removed from the tail.
\f4adjmsg\f1 fails if |\^\f2len\fP\^| is greater than the number of
bytes in \f2mp\f1.  If \f2len\fP spans more than one message block in the
message, the messages blocks must be the same type, or else \f4adjmsg\fP
will fail.
.SH RETURN VALUE
If the message can be trimmed successfully, 1 is returned.  Otherwise,
0 is returned.
.SH LEVEL
Base or Interrupt.
.SH NOTES
Does not sleep.
.sp 0.5
If \f2len\fP is greater than the amount of data in a single message block, that
message block is not freed.  Rather, it is left linked in the message, and its
read and write pointers are set equal to each other, indicating no data present
in the block.

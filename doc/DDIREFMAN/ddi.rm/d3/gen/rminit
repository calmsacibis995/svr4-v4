.SH ARGUMENTS
.RS 0n 10
.IP "\f2mp\f1" 10n
Pointer to the map describing the private space.
.IP "\f2mapsize\f1" 10n
Number of entries in the map table.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4rminit\f1 function initializes a private space management
map structure that can
be used for the allocation of space.
.P
Although \f4rminit\f1 initializes the map structure
itself, it does not allocate the space that the map will manage.
This space must be allocated separately and must be added to the
map using \f4rmfree\fP(D3DK) prior to attempting to allocate space
from the map using \f4rmalloc\fP(D3DK).
.P
The system maintains the map list structure by size and index.
The caller places whatever semantics on the units of size are appropriate
for the type of space being managed.
For example, units may be byte
addresses, pages of memory, or blocks.
The elements of the map
are sorted by index.
.SH RETURN VALUE
None.
.SH LEVEL
Base or Interrupt.
.SH NOTES
Does not sleep.
.sp 0.5
The map array must be initialized to zero before calling
\f4rminit\f1.
.sp 0.5
Three map entries are reserved for use by the system and are not available
for general map use.  Therefore, \f2mapsize\fP must be greater than three.

The number of microseconds to busy-wait.
.RE
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4drv_usecwait\f1 causes the caller to busy-wait for at least the number
of microseconds specified by \f2microsecs\f1.
The amount of time spent busy-waiting may be greater than the time specified
by \f2microsecs\f1 but will not be less.
\f4drv_usecwait\f1 should only be used to wait for short periods of time
(less than a clock tick) or when it is necessary to wait without sleeping
(for example, at interrupt level).
When the desired delay is at least as long as clock tick and it is possible
to sleep, the \f4delay\f1(D3DK) function should be used instead since it
will not waste processor time busy-waiting as \f4drv_usecwait\f1 does.
.P
Because excessive busy-waiting is wasteful the driver should only
make calls to \f4drv_usecwait\f1 as needed, and only for as much time as
needed.
\f4drv_usecwait\f1 does not raise the interrupt priority level;
if the driver wishes to block interrupts for the duration of the wait,
it is the driver's responsibility to set the priority level before the call
and restore it to its original value afterward.
.SH RETURN VALUE
None.
.SH LEVEL
Base or Interrupt.
.SH NOTES
Does not sleep.
.sp 0.5
Busy-waiting can increase the preemption latency experienced by high priority
processes.
Since short and bounded preemption latency can be critical in a real time
environment, drivers intended for use in such an environment should not use this
interface or should limit the length of the wait to an appropriately short
length of time.

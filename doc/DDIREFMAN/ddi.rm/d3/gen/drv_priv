.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
The \f4drv_priv\f1 function determines
whether the credentials specified by the credential
structure pointed to by \f2crp\f1 identify a privileged
process.
This function should only be used when file access modes and
special minor device numbers are insufficient to provide the
necessary protection for the driver operation being performed.
Calls to \f4drv_priv\f1 should replace all
calls to \f4suser\f1
and any explicit checks for effective user ID equal to zero
in driver code.
.P
A credential structure pointer is passed into
various driver entry point functions (\f4open\f1(D2DK),
\f4close\f1(D2DK), \f4read\f1(D2DK), \f4write\f1(D2DK),
and \f4ioctl\f1(D2DK)) and can also be obtained
by calling \f4drv_getparm\f1(D3DK) from base level
driver code.
.SH "RETURN VALUE" 
This routine returns 0 if the specified credentials
identify a privileged process and \f4EPERM\f1 otherwise.
.SH LEVEL
Base or Interrupt.
.SH NOTES
Does not sleep.
.sp 0.5
The only valid use for a credential structure pointer is as an argument to
\f4drv_priv\f1.
The contents of a credential structure are not defined by the
DDI/DKI and a driver may not examine the contents of the
structure directly.

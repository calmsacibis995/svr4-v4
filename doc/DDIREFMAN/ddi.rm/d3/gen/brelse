.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4brelse\fP function returns the buffer specified by \f2bp\fP
to the system's buffer free list and wakes up any sleeping
processes that are waiting either for this specific buffer to become free,
or for any buffer to become available on the free list.
The buffer specified by \f2bp\fP must have been previously allocated
by a call to \f4geteblk\fP(D3DK) or \f4ngeteblk\fP(D3DK).
\f4brelse\fP may not be called to release a buffer which has been allocated
by any other means.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
None.
.SH LEVEL
Base or Interrupt.
.SH NOTES

.sp 0.5
void ASSERT(int \f2expression\f4);\f1

.SH ARGUMENTS

Expression to be evaluated.

.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4ASSERT\f1 is a debugging interface for verifying program invariants
within code that is compiled with the \f4DEBUG\f1 compilation option
defined.
\f2expression\f1 is a boolean expression that the caller expects to
evaluate to non-zero (that is, the caller is asserting that the expression
has a non-zero value).
If \f2expression\f1 evaluates to non-zero, the \f4ASSERT\f1
call has no effect.
If \f2expression\f1 evaluates to zero, \f4ASSERT\f1 causes the system
to panic with the following message:
.P
.RS
PANIC: assertion failed: \f2expression\f1, file: \f2filename\f1, line: \f2lineno\f1
.RE
.P
where \f2filename\f1 is the name of the source file in which the failed
assertion appears and \f2lineno\f1 is the line number of the \f4ASSERT\f1
call within the file.
.P
When the \f4DEBUG\f1 compilation option is not defined,
\f4ASSERT\f1 calls are not compiled into the code, and therefore have
no effect.
.SH RETURN VALUE
If \f2expression\f1 evaluates to non-zero, \f4ASSERT\f1 returns no value.
If \f2expression\f1 evaluates to zero, \f4ASSERT\f1 panics the system.
.SH LEVEL
Base or Interrupt.
.SH NOTES
Does not sleep.

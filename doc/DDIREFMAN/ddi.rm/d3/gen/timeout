.SH NAME
\f4timeout\f1 \- execute a function after a specified length of time
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.na
\f4#include <sys/types.h>
.sp 0.5
int timeout(void (*\f2fn\f4)(), caddr_t \f2arg, \f4long \f2ticks\f4);\f1
.ad
.fi
.SH ARGUMENTS
.RS 0n 10
.IP "\f2fn\f1" 10n
Function to execute when the time increment expires.
.IP "\f2arg\f1" 10n
Argument to the function.
.IP "\f2ticks\f1" 10n
Number of clock ticks to wait before the function is called.
A value of zero implies the function should be run as soon as possible.
.RE
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4timeout\f1 schedules the specified function to be
called after the time interval specified by \f2ticks\fP.
\f2arg\fP will be passed as the only argument to function \f2fn\fP.
The \f4timeout\f1 call returns immediately without waiting for the
specified function to execute.
.P
The length of time before the function is called is not guaranteed to be
exactly equal to the requested time, but will be at least \f2ticks\fP
clock ticks in length.
The function specified by \f2fn\fP must neither sleep nor reference process context.
When it runs, all interrupts will be blocked.  The function should not call any routine
that will lower the processor priority level.
.SH RETURN VALUE
If the function specified by \f2fn\fP is successfully scheduled, \f4timeout\fP
returns an identifier that can be passed to \f4untimeout\fP(D3DK) to cancel
the request.
If the function could not be scheduled (because the \f4timeout\f1 table is full),
the following panic message results:
.P
.RS
\f4PANIC:  Timeout table overflow\f1
.RE
.SH LEVEL
Base or Interrupt.
.SH NOTES
Does not sleep.
.sp 0.5
Drivers should be careful to cancel any pending \f4timeout\fP functions that access
data structures before these structures are de-initialized or deallocated.
.sp 0.5
After the time interval has expired, \f2fn\fP only runs if the processor is
at base level.  Otherwise, \f2fn\fP is deferred until some time in the near future.

.SH NAME
\f4copyin\f1 \- copy data from a user buffer to a driver buffer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.na
\f4#include <sys/types.h>
.sp 0.5
int copyin(caddr_t \f2userbuf, \f4caddr_t \f2driverbuf, \f4size_t \f2count\f4);\f1
.ad
.fi
.SH ARGUMENTS
.RS 0n 13
.IP "\f2userbuf\f1" 10n
User source address from which copy is made.
.IP "\f2driverbuf\f1" 10n
Driver destination address to which copy is made.
.IP "\f2count\f1" 10n
Number of bytes to copy.
.RE
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4copyin\f1 copies \f2count\f1 bytes of data from the user virtual
address specified by \f2userbuf\f1 to the kernel virtual address
specified by \f2driverbuf\f1.
The driver must ensure that adequate space is
allocated for the destination address.
.P
\f4copyin\fP chooses the best algorithm based on address alignment and number of bytes to copy.
Although the source and destination addresses are not required to
be word aligned, word aligned addresses may result in a more efficient
copy.
.SH RETURN VALUE
If the copy is successful, 0 is returned.
Otherwise, \-1 is returned to indicate that the specified user address
range is not valid.
.SH LEVEL
Base Only.
.SH NOTES
May sleep.
.sp 0.5
Drivers usually convert a return value of \-1 into an \f4EFAULT\fP error.

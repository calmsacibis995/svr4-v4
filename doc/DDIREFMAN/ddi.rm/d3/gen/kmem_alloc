\f4kmem_alloc\f1 \- allocate space from kernel free memory

.SH SYNOPSIS

\f4#include <sys/types.h>

.SH ARGUMENTS
.RS 0n 10
.IP "\f2size\f1" 10n
Number of bytes to allocate.
.IP "\f2flag\f1" 10n
Specifies whether the caller is willing to sleep waiting for memory.
If \f2flag\f1 is set to \f4KM_SLEEP\f1, the caller will sleep
if necessary until the specified amount of memory is available.
If \f2flag\f1 is set to \f4KM_NOSLEEP\f1, the caller will not sleep,
but \f4kmem_alloc\f1 will return \f4NULL\f1 if the specified amount
of memory is not immediately available.

.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4kmem_alloc\f1 allocates \f2size\f1 bytes of kernel
memory and returns a pointer to the allocated memory.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful completion, \f4kmem_alloc\f1 returns a pointer to the
allocated memory.
If \f4KM_NOSLEEP\f1 is specified and sufficient memory is not immediately
available, \f4kmem_alloc\f1 returns a \f4NULL\f1 pointer.
If \f2size\f1 is set to \f40\f1, \f4kmem_alloc\f1 returns \f4NULL\f1
regardless of the value of \f2flag\f1.
.SH LEVEL
Base only if \f2flag\f1 is set to \f4KM_SLEEP\f1.
Base or interrupt if \f2flag\f1 is set to \f4KM_NOSLEEP\f1.
.SH NOTES
May sleep if \f2flag\f1 is set to \f4KM_SLEEP\f1.
.sp 0.5
Kernel memory is a limited resource and should be used judiciously.
Memory allocated using \f4kmem_alloc\f1 should be freed as soon as
possible.
Drivers should not use local freelists for memory or similar schemes
that cause the memory to be held for longer than necessary.
.sp 0.5
Since holding memory allocated using \f4kmem_alloc\f1 for extended periods
of time (e.g allocating memory at system startup and never freeing it)
can have an adverse effect on overall memory usage and system performance,
memory needed for such extended periods should be statically allocated whenever
possible.
.sp 0.5
The address returned by a successful call to \f4kmem_alloc\f1 is
word-aligned.

The number of clock ticks to delay.
.RE
.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
\f4delay\f1 causes the caller to sleep for the amount of time specified
by \f2ticks\f1, which is in units of clock ticks.
The exact length of the delay is not guaranteed but it will not be less
than \f2ticks\f1 clock ticks.
The length of a clock tick can vary across different implementations and
therefore drivers should not include any hard-coded assumptions about
the length of a tick.
The \f4drv_usectohz\f1(D3DK) and \f4drv_hztousec\f1(D3DK) functions
can be used, as necessary, to convert between clock ticks and microseconds
(implementation independent units).
.P
The \f4delay\f1 function calls
\f4timeout\f1(D3DK) to schedule a wakeup after the specified amount of
time has elapsed.  \f4delay\f1 then goes to sleep until \f4timeout\f1 wakes
up the sleeping process.
.SH "RETURN VALUE" 
None.
.SH "LEVEL" 
Base Only.
.SH NOTES
Function sleeps.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.RS 0n 10
.IP "\f2addr\f1" 10n
Address of the allocated memory to be returned.
\f2addr\f1 must specify the same address that was
returned by the corresponding call to \f4kmem_alloc\f1(D3DK) or
\f4kmem_zalloc\f1(D3DK) which allocated the memory.
.IP "\f2size\f1" 10n
Number of bytes to free.
The \f2size\f1 parameter must specify the same number of bytes as
was allocated by the corresponding call to
\f4kmem_alloc\f1 or \f4kmem_zalloc\f1.

.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4kmem_free\f1 returns \f2size\f1 bytes of previously allocated kernel memory.
The \f2addr\f1 and \f2size\f1 arguments must specify exactly one complete area
of memory that was allocated by a call to
\f4kmem_alloc\f1 or \f4kmem_zalloc\f1 (that is, the memory cannot be freed
piecemeal).
.SH RETURN VALUE
None.
.SH LEVEL
Base or Interrupt.
.SH NOTES
Does not sleep.

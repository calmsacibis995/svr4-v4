.SH ARGUMENTS
.RS 0n
.IP "\f2p\f1" 10n
Pointer to the process being signaled.
.IP "\f2sig\f1" 10n
Signal to send.  Valid signals are listed in \f4signals\fP(D5DK).
.RE
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4psignal\f1 is called by drivers to send a signal to a single
process.  If
the process being sent the signal has called \f4sleep\f1(D3K) to wait
at a priority numerically higher than \f4PZERO\f1, and if \f4PCATCH\fP has not
been \f4OR\fP'ed in with the sleep priority, \f4psignal\f1 makes the
process executable.  \f4PZERO\f1 and \f4PCATCH\fP are defined in \f4sys/param.h\f1.
.P
A pointer to the currently running process can be obtained by calling
\f4drv_getparm\fP(D3DK).
.SH RETURN VALUE
None.
.SH LEVEL
Base or Interrupt.
.SH NOTES
Does not sleep.
.sp 0.5
STREAMS drivers and modules should not call \f4psignal\fP.  To generate a signal,
they must send \f4M_SIG\fP or \f4M_PCSIG\fP messages.

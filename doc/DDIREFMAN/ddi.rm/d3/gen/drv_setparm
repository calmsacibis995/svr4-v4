.SH ARGUMENTS
.RS 0n 10
.IP "\f2parm\f1" 10n
The kernel parameter to be updated.
Possible values are:
.P
.RS 12
.TP 10
\f4SYSCANC\f1
Add \f2value\f1 to \f4sysinfo.canch\f1.
\f4sysinfo.canch\f1 is a count of the number of
characters received from a terminal device after the characters have been
processed to remove special characters such as \f2break\fP or \f2backspace\fP.
.TP
\f4SYSMINT\f1
Add \f2value\f1 to \f4sysinfo.mdmint\f1.
\f4sysinfo.mdmint\f1 is a count of the number of
modem interrupts received.
.TP
\f4SYSOUTC\f1
Add \f2value\f1 to \f4sysinfo.outch\f1.
\f4sysinfo.outch\f1 is a count of the number of characters
output to a terminal device.
.TP
\f4SYSRAWC\f1
Add \f2value\f1 to \f4sysinfo.rawc\f1.
\f4sysinfo.rawc\f1 is a count of the number of characters
received from a terminal device, before canonical processing has occurred.
.TP
\f4SYSRINT\f1
Add \f2value\f1 to \f4sysinfo.rcvint\f1.
\f4sysinfo.rcvint\f1 is a count of the number of
interrupts generated by data ready to be received from a terminal device.
.TP
\f4SYSXINT\f1
Add \f2value\f1 to \f4sysinfo.xmtint\f1.
\f4sysinfo.xmtint\f1 is a count of the number of
interrupts generated by data ready to be transmitted to a terminal device.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\f4drv_setparm\fP verifies that \f2parm\f1 corresponds to a kernel
parameter that may be modified.
If the value of \f2parm\f1 corresponds to a parameter
that may not be modified, \-1 is returned.
Otherwise, the parameter is incremented by \f2value\f1.
.P
No checking is performed to determine the validity of \f2value\f1.
It is the driver's responsibility to guarantee the
correctness of \f2value\f1.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.P
If the function is successful, 0 is returned.
Otherwise, \-1 is returned to indicate that \f2parm\fP specified
an invalid parameter.
.SH LEVEL
Base or Interrupt.
.SH NOTES
Does not sleep.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.RS 0n 10
.IP "\f2base\f1" 10n
Address of driver-supplied data buffer.
.IP "\f2size\f1" 10n
Number of bytes in data buffer.
.IP "\f2pri\f1" 10n
Priority of allocation request (used to allocate the message and data blocks.)
Valid values are \f4BPRI_LO\fP, \f4BPRI_MED\fP, and \f4BPRI_HI\fP.
.IP "\f2fr_rtnp\f1" 10n
Pointer to the free-routine data structure.

.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4esballoc\f1 creates a STREAMS message and attaches a driver-supplied
data buffer in place of a STREAMS data buffer.
It allocates a message and data block header only.
The driver-supplied data buffer, pointed to by \f2base\f1, is used as the
data buffer for the message.
.P
When \f4freeb\f1(D3DK) is called to free the message, on the last reference to the
message, the driver's
free-routine, specified by the \f4free_func\fP field in the \f4free_rtn\fP(D4DK)
structure, is called with one argument, specified by the \f4free_arg\fP field,
to free the data buffer.
.P
Instead of requiring a specific number of arguments, the \f4free_arg\f1
field is defined of type \f4char *\f1.
This way, the driver can pass a pointer to a structure if more than one
argument is needed.
.P
When the \f4free_func\f1 function runs, interrupts from all STREAMS devices will be
blocked.  It has no user context and may not call any routine that sleeps.
The function may not access any dynamically allocated data structures that
might no longer exist when it runs.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, a pointer to the newly allocated message block is returned.
On failure, \f4NULL\f1 is returned.
.SH LEVEL
Base or Interrupt.
.SH NOTES
Does not sleep.

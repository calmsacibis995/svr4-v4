\f4bcanput\fP \- test for flow control in specified priority band

.IP "\f2q\fP" 10n
Pointer to the message queue.
.IP "\f2pri\fP" 10n
Message priority.

.SH DESCRIPTION
Like the \f4canput\fP(D3DK) function,
\f4bcanput\fP searches through the stream (starting at \f2q\fP)
until it finds a queue containing
a service routine, or until it reaches
the end of the stream.
If found, the queue containing the service routine
is tested to see if a message of priority \f2pri\fP can be enqueued.
If the band is full, \f4bcanput\fP marks the queue to automatically
back-enable the caller's service routine when the amount of data
in messages on the queue has reached its low water mark.
.P
If \f2pri\fP is 0, the \f4bcanput\fP call is equivalent to
a call to \f4canput\fP.
.P
It is possible because of race conditions to test for room using \f4bcanput\fP
and get an indication that there is room for a message, and then have
the queue fill up before subsequently enqueuing the message, causing
a violation of flow control.
This is not a problem, since the violation of flow control in this case
is bounded.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
\f4bcanput\fP returns 1 if a message of priority \f2pri\fP can be sent in the stream,
or 0 if the priority band is flow-controlled.
If \f4bcanput\fP reaches the end of the stream without finding a queue
with a service routine, then it returns 1.
.SH LEVEL
Base or Interrupt.
.SH NOTES
Does not sleep.
.sp 0.5
The driver is responsible for both testing a queue with
\f4bcanput\fP and refraining from placing a message on the queue if
\f4bcanput\fP fails.

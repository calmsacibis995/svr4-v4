.SH NAME
\f4bzero\f1 \- clear memory for a given number of bytes 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.na
\f4#include <sys/types.h>
.sp 0.5
void bzero(\f4caddr_t \f2addr, \f4size_t\f1 \f2bytes\f4);\f1
.ad
.fi
.SH ARGUMENTS
.RS 0n 10
.IP "\f2addr\f1" 10n
Starting virtual address of memory to be cleared.
.IP "\f2bytes\f1" 10n
The number of bytes to clear.
.RE
.SH DESCRIPTION\f1
The \f4bzero\f1 function clears a contiguous portion of memory by
filling the memory with zeros.
It chooses the best algorithm based on address alignment and number of bytes to clear.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
None.
.SH LEVEL
Base or Interrupt.
.SH NOTES
Does not sleep.
.sp 0.5
There are no alignment restrictions on \f2addr\fP, and no length restrictions
on \f2bytes\fP, other than
the address range specified must be within the
kernel address space and must be memory resident.
No range checking is done.
Since there is no mechanism by which drivers that conform to the
rules of the DDI/DKI can obtain and use a kernel address that is not
memory resident (an address that is paged out),
DDI/DKI conforming drivers can assume that any address to which they
have access is memory resident and therefore a valid argument to \f4bzero\f1.
An address within user address space is not a valid argument,
and specifying such an address may cause the driver to corrupt the system in an
unpredictable way.

.SH EXAMPLE
In a driver \f4close\f1(D2DK) routine, rather than clear each individual
member of its private data structure, the driver 
could use \f4bzero\f1 as shown here:
.P
.RS 3n
.ps 8
\f4bzero((caddr_t)&drv_dat[getminor(dev)], sizeof(struct drvr_data));\f1

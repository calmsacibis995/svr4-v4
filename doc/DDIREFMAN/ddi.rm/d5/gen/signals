.SH DESCRIPTION
There are two ways to send a signal to a process.  The first, \f4psignal\fP(D3K),
can be used by non-STREAMS drivers.  The second, by using an \f4M_SIG\fP or \f4M_PCSIG\fP
message, can be used by STREAMS drivers and modules.
The following is a list of the signals that drivers may send to processes.
.IP \f4SIGHUP\fP 12n
The device has been disconnected.
.IP \f4SIGINT\fP
The interrupt character has been received.
.IP \f4SIGQUIT\fP
The quit character has been received.
.IP \f4SIGWINCH\fP
The window size has changed.
.IP \f4SIGURG\fP
Urgent data are available.
.IP \f4SIGPOLL\fP
A pollable event has occurred.
.IP \f4SIGTSTP\fP
Interactive stop of the process.
.SH NOTES
The signal \f4SIGTSTP\fP cannot be generated with \f4psignal\fP.
It is only valid when generated from a stream.

.SH DESCRIPTION
This section describes the data definitions a developer needs to include
in a device driver.  The system finds this information in an implementation-specific
manner, usually tied to the way system configuration is handled.
.P
Each driver is uniquely identified by a prefix string specified in its
configuration file.
The name of all the driver-supplied routines and global variables
should begin with this prefix.  This will reduce the chance of a symbol collision
with another driver.  Any private routines defined by a driver that are not entry point
routines should be declared as \f4static\fP.  Also, any global variables that
are private to the driver should be declared as \f4static\fP.

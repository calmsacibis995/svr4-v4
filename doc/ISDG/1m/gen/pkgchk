.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4pkgchk\f1
checks the accuracy of installed files or,
by use of the \f4\-l\f1 option,
displays information about package files.
The command checks the integrity of directory structures and the files.
Discrepancies are reported
on \f4stderr\f1 along with a detailed explanation of the problem.
.PP
The first synopsis defined above is used to list or check the
contents and/or attributes of objects
that are currently installed on the system.
Package names may be listed on the command line,
or by default the entire contents of a machine will be checked.
.PP
The second synopsis is used to list or check the contents of a package
which has been spooled on the specified device, but not installed.
Note that attributes cannot be checked for spooled packages.
.PP
The third synopsis is used to list or check the contents and/or attributes
of objects which are described in the indicated \f2pkgmap\f1.
.PP
The option definitions are:
.TP .5i
\f4\-l\f1
Lists information on the selected files that make up a package.
It is not compatible with the \f4a\f1,
\f4c\f1,
\f4f\f1,
\f4g\f1,
and \f4v\f1 options.
.TP
\f4\-a\f1
Audits the file attributes only, does not check file contents.
Default is to check both.
.TP
\f4\-c\f1
Audits the file contents only, does not check file attributes.
Default is to check both.
.TP
\f4\-f\f1
Corrects file attributes if possible.
When \f4pkgchk\f1 is invoked with this option it creates directories, named
pipes, links and special devices if they do not already exist.
.TP
\f4-q\f1
Quiet mode.
Does not give messages about missing files.
.TP
\f4-v\f1
Verbose mode.
Files are listed as processed.
.TP
\f4-n\f1
Does not check volatile or editable files.
This should be used for most post-installation checking.
.TP
\f4-x\f1
Searches exclusive directories only,
looking for files which exist that are not
in the installation software database
or the indicated \f2pkgmap\f1 file.
If used with the \f4-f\fP option,
hidden files are removed;
no other checking is done.
.TP
\f4-p\f1
Only checks the accuracy of the pathname or pathnames listed.
\f2pathname\f1
can be one or more pathnames separated by commas (or by white space, if
the list is quoted).
.TP
\f4-i\f1
Reads a list of pathnames from \f2file\f1 and compares this list against the
in\%stallation software database
or the indicated \f2pkgmap\f1 file.
Pathnames which are not contained in \f2inputfile\f1 are not checked.
.TP
\f4\-d\f1
Specifies the device on which a spooled package resides.
\f2device\f1 can be
a directory pathname or the identifiers for tape, floppy disk or removable disk
(for example, \f4/var/tmp\f1 or \f4/dev/diskette\f1).
.TP
\f4\-m\f1
Requests that the package be checked against the pkgmap file \f2pkgmap\f1.
.TP
\f4\-e\f1
Requests that the pkginfo file named as \f2envfile\f1 be used to resolve
parameters noted in the specified pkgmap file.
.TP
\f2pkginst\f1
Specifies the package instance or instances to be checked.
The format \f2pkginst\f4.\(**\f1 can be used
to check all instances of a package.
When using this format,
enclose the command line in single quotes
to prevent the shell from interpreting the \(** character.
The default is to display all information about all installed
packages.
.SH NOTES
To remove hidden files only,
use the \f4-f\fP and \f4-x\fP options together.
To remove hidden files and check attributes
and contents of files, 
use the \f4-f\fP, \f4-x\fP, \f4-c\fP,
and \f4-a\fP options together.

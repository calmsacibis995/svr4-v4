.SH NAME
\f4idmknod\f1 \- removes nodes and reads specifications of nodes
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4idmknod\f1 [\f2options\fP]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This command performs the following functions:
.P
.RS
Removes the nodes for non-required devices
(those that do not have an \f4r\f1 in field 3 of the the device's
\f4mdevice\f1 entry) from \f4/dev\f1\|.
Ordinary files will not be removed.
If the
\f4/dev\f1
directory contains subdirectories,
those subdirectories will be traversed
and nodes found for non-required devices will be removed as well.
If empty subdirectories result due to the removal of nodes,
the subdirectories are then removed.
.sp .4v
Reads the specifications of nodes given in the files contained in
\f4/etc/conf/node.d\f1
and installs these nodes in
\f4/dev\f1\|.
If the node \%specification defines a path containing subdirectories,
the subdirectories will be made automatically.
.sp .4v
Returns 0 on success and a positive number on error.
.RE
.P
The
\f4idmknod\f1
command is run automatically upon entering init state 2
on the next system reboot after a kernel reconfiguration to establish
the correct representation of device nodes in the
\f4/dev\f1
directory for the running
\f4/unix\f1
kernel.
\f4idmknod\f1
can be called as a user level command to test modification of the
\f4/dev\f1
directory before a Driver Software Package (DSP) is actually built.
It is also useful in in\%stallation scripts
that do not reconfigure the kernel, but need to create
\f4/dev\f1
entries.
.P
The files in
\f4/etc/conf/node.d\f1
are copies of the
I. Node
modules installed by device DSPs.
There is at most one file per DSP.
Each file contains one line for each node that is to be installed.
The format of each line is:
.TP .25i
Name of device entry (field 1) in the \f4mdevice\f1 file.
(The \f4mdevice\f1 entry will be the line installed by the DSP from
its \f2Master\fP module.)
This field must be from 1 to 8 characters in length.
The first character must be a letter.
The others may be letters, digits, or underscores.
.TP .25i
Name of node to be inserted in \f4/dev\f1.
The first character must be a letter.
The others may be letters, digits, or underscores.
This field can be a path relative to
\f4/dev\f1 ,
and
\f4idmknod\f1
will create subdirectories as needed.
.TP .25i
The character \f4b\f1 or \f4c\f1.
A \f4b\f1 indicates that the node is a 'block'
type device and \f4c\f1 indicates 'character' type device.
.sp .5
For devices having multiple major numbers, the following
scheme is used to specify which device nodes belong to which
major.  The third field is expanded to specify a major number
offset as follows:
.sp .5
"[b/c]: maj_off", where [b/c] refers to either block or
character major and maj_off refers to an offset number within
the major number range in the \f4mdevice\f1 file.  For example
a specification "C:2" refers to a character major offset 2,
which for a major range of "15-18" would translate to
character major 17.
.TP
Minor device number.
If this field is a non-numeric, it is assumed to
be a request for a streams clone device node, and
\f4idmknod\f1
will set the minor number to the value of the major number
of the device specified
[see mknod(2) in the \f2Programmer's Reference Manual\fP for information
on minor device number values].
.TP
User id.
The integer value in this field describes the ownership
of the node to be made.
.TP
Group id.
The integer value in this field describes the group
ownership of the node to be created.
.TP
Permission.
The value expected must be in octal form,
in the manner in which permissions are described to the \f4chmod\f1(1) command
(i.e. 0777).
.P
Some example node file entries are as follows:
.TP 1.35i
\f4asy  tty00  c  1\f1
makes \f4/dev/tty00\f1 for device \f4asy\f1 using minor device 1.
.TP 1.35i
\f4qt  rmt/c0s0  c  4\f1
makes \f4/dev/rmt/c0s0\f1 for device \f4qt\f1 using minor device 4.
.TP 1.35i
\f4clone  net/nau/clone  c  nau\f1
makes \f4/dev/net/nau/clone\f1 for device \f4clone\f1.
The minor device number is set to the major device number
of device \f4nau\f1.
.TP 1.35i
\f4scsi	tty1  C:0  5
makes \f4tty1\f1 for device \f4scsi\f1 using minor device 1
major_number offset 0.
.P
The command line options are:
.TP "\w'\-o\ directory\ \ \ 'u"
\f4\-o \f2directory\f1
 Nodes will be installed in the directory specified rather than
\f4/dev\f1.
.TP
\f4\-i \f2directory\f1
The file \f4mdevice\f1 which normally resides in
\f4/etc/conf/cf.d\f1 ,
can be found in the directory specified.
.TP
\f4\-e \f2directory\f1
The
.I Node
modules that normally reside in
\f4/etc/conf/node.d\f1
can be found in the directory specified.
.TP
\f4\-s\f1
Suppress removing nodes (just add new nodes).
.SH "ERROR MESSAGES"
An exit value of zero indicates success.
If an error was encountered
due to a syntax or format error in a
.I node
entry, an advisory message will be printed to
.I stdout
and the command will continue.
If a serious error is encountered
(i.e., a required\p
.br
.ne 2
 file cannot be found),
\f4idmknod\f1
will exit with a non-zero value and report an error message.
All error messages are designed to be self-explanatory.

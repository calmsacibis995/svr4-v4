.SH NAME
\f4idspace\f1 \- investigates free space
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/etc/conf/bin/idspace\f1 [ \f4\-i\f1 \f2inodes\f1 ] [ \f4\-r\f1 \f2blocks\f1 ] [ \f4\-u\f1 \f2blocks\f1 ]
.br
\ \ \ [ \f4\-t\f1 \f2blocks\f1 ]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This command investigates free space in \f4/\f1, \f4/usr\f1,
and \f4/tmp\f1 file systems to determine whether sufficient
disk blocks and inodes exist in each of potentially 3 file systems.
The default tests that
\f4idspace\f1
performs are as follows:
.P
.RS
Verify that the \f4root\f1 file system
(\f4/\f1)
has 400 blocks more than the size of the current \f4/unix\f1\|.
This verifies that a device driver being added to the current
\f4/unix\f1
can be built and placed in the \f4root\f1 directory.
A check is also made to insure that 100 inodes exist
in the \f4root\f1 directory.
.sp .4v
Determine whether a
\f4/usr\f1
file system exists.
If it does exist, a test is made that 400 free blocks
and 100 inodes are available in that file system.
If the file system does not exist,
\f4idspace\f1
does not complain since files created in
\f4/usr\f1
by the reconfiguration process will be created in the \f4root\f1 file system
and space requirements are covered by the test in (1.) above.
.sp .4v
Determine whether a
\f4/tmp\f1
file system exists.
If it does exist, a test is made that 400 free blocks
and 100 inodes are available in that file system.
If the file system does not exist,
\f4idspace\f1
does not complain since files created in
\f4/tmp\f1
by the reconfiguration process will be created in the \f4root\f1 file system
and space requirements are covered by the test in (1.) above.
.RE
.P
The command line options are:
.TP "\w'\-o\ inodes\ \ \ 'u"
\f4\-i \f2inodes\f1
This option overrides the default test for 100 inode in all of the
\f4idspace\f1
checks.
.TP
\f4\-r \f2blocks\f1
This option overrides the default test for
\f4/unix\f1
size + 400 blocks when checking the \f4root\f1 (\f4/\f1)
file system.
When the
\f4\-r\f1
option is used, the
\f4/usr\f1
and
\f4/tmp\f1
file systems are not tested unless explicitly specified.
.TP
\f4\-u \f2blocks\f1
This option overrides the default test for 400 blocks when checking the
\f4/usr\f1
file system.
When the
\f4\-u\f1
option is used, the \f4root\f1 (\f4/\f1)
and
\f4/tmp\f1
file systems are not tested unless explicitly specified.
If
\f4/usr\f1
is not a separate file system, an error is reported.
.TP
\f4\-t \f2blocks\f1
This option overrides the default test for 400 blocks when checking the
\f4/tmp\f1
file system.
When the
\f4\-t\f1
option is used, the \f4root\f1 (\f4/\f1)
and
\f4/usr\f1
file systems are not tested unless explicitly specified.
If
\f4/tmp\f1
is not a separate file system, an error is reported.
.bp
.SH "ERROR MESSAGES"
An exit value of zero indicates success.
If insufficient space exists in a file system
or an error was encountered due to a syntax or format error,
\f4idspace\f1
will report a message.
All error messages are designed to be self-explanatory.
The specific exit values are as follows:
.TP "\w'0\ \ \ \ 'u"
0
success.
.TP
1
command syntax error, or needed file does not exist.
.TP
2
file system has insufficient space or inodes.
.TP
3
requested file system does not exist
( \f4\-u\f1
and
\f4\-t\f1
options only).
.SH "SEE ALSO"

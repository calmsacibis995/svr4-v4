.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4pkginfo\f1
displays information about software packages which are installed on the system
(with the first synopsis) 
or which reside on a particular device or directory
(with the second synopsis).
Only the package name and abbreviation 
for pre-System V Release 4
packages will be included in the display.
.PP
The options for this command are:
.TP 10
\f4-q\f1
Does not list any information,
but can be used from a program to check (that is, query)
whether or not a package has been installed.
.TP 10
\f4-x\f1
Designates an extracted listing of package information.
It contains the
package abbreviation, package name, package architecture (if available) and
package version (if available). 
.TP 10
\f4-l\f1
Designates long format,
which includes all available information
about the designated package(s).
.TP 10
\f4-p\f1
Designates that information should be presented only for partially installed
packages.
.TP 10
\f4-i\f1
Designates that information should be presented only for fully installed
packages. 
.TP 10
\f4-a\f1
Specifies the architecture of the package as \f2arch\f1.
.TP 10
\f4-v\f1
Specifies the version of the package as \f2version\f1.
All compatible versions can be requested by 
preceding the version name with a tilde (\f4~\fP).
The list produced by \f4-v\fP will include
pre-Release 4 packages
(with which no version numbers are associated).
Multiple white spaces are replaced with a single space
during version comparison.
.TP 10
\f4-c\f1
Selects packages to be display based on the 
category \f2category\f1.
(Categories
are defined in the category field of the \f4pkginfo\fP file.) 
If more than one category is supplied, the package must only match one of the
list of categories.
The match is not case specific.
.TP 10
\f2pkginst\f1
Designates a package by its instance.
An instance can be the package
abbreviation or a specific instance (for example,
\f4inst.1\f1 or \f4inst.beta\f1).
All instances of package can be requested by 
\f4inst.\(**\f1.
When using this format,
enclose the command line in single quotes
to prevent the shell from interpreting the \(** character.
.TP 10
\f4-d\f1
Defines a device, \f2device\f1, on which the software resides.
\f2device\f1
can be a full pathname to a directory 
or the identifiers for tape, floppy disk, removable
disk, and so on.
The special token ``spool'' may be used to indicate the default
installation spool directory.
.SH NOTES
Without options, \f4pkginfo\f1 lists the primary category,
package instance, and
name of all completely installed and partially installed
packages.
One line per package selected is produced.
.PP
The \f4-p\f1 and \f4-i\f1 options are meaningless if used in conjunction
with the \f4-d\f1 option.
.PP
The options \f4-q\f1, \f4-x\f1, and \f4-l\f1 are mutually exclusive.
.PP
\f4pkginfo\f1 cannot tell if a pre-Release 4 package is only partially installed.
It is assumed that all pre-Release 4 packages are fully installed.

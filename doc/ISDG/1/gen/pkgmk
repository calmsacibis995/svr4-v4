.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4pkgmk\f1
produces an installable package to be used as input to the \f4pkgadd\f1
command.
The package contents will be in directory structure format.
.PP
The command uses the package \f4prototype\fP file as input 
and creates a \f4pkgmap\fP
file.
The contents for each entry in the \f4prototype\fP file is copied to the
appropriate output location.
Information concerning the contents (checksum,
file size, modification date) is computed and stored in the \f4pkgmap\fP file,
along with attribute information specified in the \f4prototype\fP file.
.TP 15
\f4-o\f1
Overwrites the same instance,
package instance will be overwritten if it already exists.
.TP 15
\f4-d \f2device\f1
Creates the package on \f2device\f1.
\f2device\f1 can be a
full pathname to a directory 
or the identifiers
for a floppy disk or removable disk
(for example, \f4/dev/diskette\f1).
The default device is the installation spool directory.
.TP 15
\f4-r \f2rootpath\f1
Ignores destination paths in the \f4prototype\fP file.
Instead, uses the indicated \f2rootpath\f1 with the source
pathname appended to locate objects on the source machine.
.TP 15
\f4-b \f2basedir\f1
Prepends the indicated \f2basedir\f1 to locate relocatable objects on the
source machine.
.TP 15
\f4-l \f2limit\f1
Specifies the maximum size in 512 byte blocks
of the output device as \f2limit\f1.
By default, if the output
file is a directory or a mountable device,
\f4pkgmk\f1 will employ the \f4df\f1
command to dynamically calculate the amount of available space on the output
device.  Useful in conjunction with \f4pkgtrans\f1 to create
package with datastream format.
.TP 15
\f4-a \f2arch\f1
Overrides the architecture information provided
in the \f4pkginfo\f1 file with
\f2arch\f1.
.TP 15 
\f4-v \f2version\f1
Overrides version information provided in the \f4pkginfo\f1 file with
\f2version\f1.
.TP 15
\f4-p \f2pstamp\f1
Overrides the production stamp definition in the \f4pkginfo\f1 file with
\f2pstamp\f1.
.TP 15
\f4-f \f2prototype\f1
Uses the file \f2prototype\fP as input to the command.
The default name for this file is either \f4Prototype\f1
or \f4prototype\f1.
.TP 15
\f2variable\f4=\f2value\f1
Places the indicated variable in the packaging environment.
[See \f4prototype\fP(4) for definitions of packaging variables.]
.TP 15
\f2pkginst\f1
Specifies the package by its instance.
\f4pkgmk\fP will automatically create a new instance
if the version and/or architecture is different.
A user should specify only a package abbreviation;
a particular instance should not be specified
unless the user is overwriting it.
.SH NOTES
Architecture information is provided on the command line with 
the \f4-a\f1 option or in the \f4prototype\fP file.
If no architecture information is supplied at all, 
the output of \f4uname \-m\f1 will be used.
.PP
Version information is provided on the command line with the \f4-v\f1 
option or in the \f4prototype\fP file.
If no version information is supplied, a default based on 
the current date will be provided.
.PP
Command line definitions for both architecture and version override the
\f4prototype\fP definitions.

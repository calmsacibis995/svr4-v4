.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4ckitem\f1 builds a menu and prompts the user to choose one item
from a menu of items.
It then  verifies the response.
Options for this command define, among other things,
a prompt message whose response is a menu item, text for help and
error messages, and a default value
(which is returned if the user responds with a RETURN).
.P
By default,
the menu is formatted so that each item is prepended by a number and is printed
in columns across the terminal.
Column length is determined by the longest
choice.
Items are alphabetized.
.P
All messages are limited in length to 70 characters and
are formatted automatically.
Any white space used in the definition (including newline) is stripped.
The \f4-W\f1 option cancels the automatic formatting.
When a tilde is placed at the beginning or end of a message definition,
the default text is
inserted at that point, allowing both custom text and the default text
to be displayed.
.P
If the prompt, help or error message is not defined, the default message
(as defined under NOTES) is displayed.
.P
Two visual tool modules are linked to the \f4ckitem\f1 command.
They are
\%\f4erritem\f1 (which formats and displays an error message) and
\f4helpitem\f1 (which formats and displays a help message).
These modules should be used in conjunction with FML objects.
In this
instance, the FML object defines the prompt.
When \f2choice\f1 is defined in these modules,
the messages describe the
available menu choice (or choices).
.P
The options and arguments for this command are:
.TP
\f4\-Q\f1
Do not allow quit as a valid response.
.TP
\f4-W\f1
Use \f2width\f1 as the line length for prompt, help, and error messages.
.TP
\f4\-u\f1
Display menu items as an unnumbered list.
.TP
\f4\-n\f1
Do not display menu items in alphabetical order.
.TP
\f4\-o\f1
Return only one menu token.
.TP
\f4\-f\f1
\f2file\f1 contains a
list of menu items to be displayed.
[The format of this file is: \f2token<tab>description\f1.
Lines beginning with a pound sign (``\f4#\fP'') are comments and
are ignored.]
.TP
\f4\-l\f1
Print \f2label\f1 above the menu.
.TP
\f4\-i\f1
\f2invis\f1 specifies invisible menu choices (choices not to be printed in 
the menu).
For example,
``\f4all\fP'' used as an invisible choice would mean it is a valid option but does not
appear in the menu.
Any number of invisible choices may be defined.
Invisible choices should be made known to a user either in the prompt or in a
help message.
.TP
\f4\-m\f1
The maximum number of menu choices allowed is \f2m\f1.
.TP
\f4\-d\f1
The default value is \f2default\f1.
The default is not validated and so does not have to meet any criteria.
.TP
\f4\-h\f1
The help message is \f2help\fP.
.TP
\f4\-e\f1
The error message is \f2error\f1.
.TP
\f4\-p\f1
The prompt message is \f2prompt\f1.
.TP
\f4\-k\f1
Send process ID \f2pid\f1 a signal if the user chooses
to abort.
.TP
\f4\-s\f1
When quit is chosen,
send \f2signal\fP to the process whose \f2pid\fP is specified by the \f4\-k\fP option.
If no signal is specified, use \f4SIGTERM\fP.
.TP
.I choice
Defines menu items.
Items should be separated by white space or newline.
.SH EXIT CODES
.nf
\f40\f1 = Successful execution
\f41\f1 = EOF on input
\f42\f1 = Usage error
\f43\f1 = User termination (quit)
\f44\f1 = No choices from which to choose
.fi
.SH NOTES
The user may input the number of the menu item if choices are numbered or as
much of the string required for a unique identification of the item.
Long menus are paged with 10 items per page.
.P
When menu entries are defined both in a file (by using the \f4\-f\f1 option)
and also on the command line, they are usually combined alphabetically.
However, if the \f4\-n\f1 option is used to suppress 
alphabetical ordering, then the entries defined in the file
are shown first, followed by
the options defined on the command line.
.P
The default prompt for \f4ckitem\f1 is:
.P
.RS

One question mark gives a help message and then redisplays the prompt.
Two question marks gives a help
message and then redisplays the menu label, the
menu and the prompt.

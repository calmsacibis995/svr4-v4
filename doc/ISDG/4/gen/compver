.SH NAME
\f4compver\f1 \- compatible versions file
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4compver\fP is an ASCII file used to specify 
previous versions of the associated package 
which are upward compatible.
It is created by a package developer.
.PP
Each line of the file 
specifies a previous version of the associated package
with which the current version is backward compatible.
.PP
Because some packages may require installation of 
a specific version of another software package,
compatibility information is extremely crucial.
Consider, for example,
a package called ``A''
which requires version ``1.0'' of application ``B''
as a prerequisite for installation.
If the customer installing ``A''
has a newer version of ``B'' (1.3), 
the \f4compver\fP file for ``B''
must indicate that ``1.3''
is compatible with version ``1.0''
in order for the customer to install package ``A.''
.SH NOTES
The comparison of the version string 
disregards white space and tabs.
It is performed on a word-by-word basis.
Thus \f41.3	Enhanced\fP and \f41.3 Enhanced\fP 
would be considered the same.

.SH NAME
\f4pkginfo\f1 \- package characteristics file
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4pkginfo\fP
is an
.SM ASCII
file that describes the characteristics of the package along with
information that helps control the flow of installation.
It is created by the
software package developer.
.PP
Each entry in the
\f4pkginfo\fP
file is a line that establishes the value of a parameter in the following
form:
.PP
.RS 16
\f2PARAM\f4="\f2value\f4"\f1
.RE
.PP
There is no required order in which the parameters must be specified within the
file.
Each parameter is described below.
Only fields marked with an asterisk are mandatory.
.TP 16
\f2PKG*\f1
Abbreviation for the package being installed, generally three characters in
length (for example, \f4dir\f1 or \f4pkg\f1).
All characters in the abbreviation must
be alphanumeric and the first may not be numeric.
The abbreviation is limited
to a maximum length of nine characters.
\f4install\f1, \f4new\f1, and \f4all\f1 are reserved abbreviations.
.TP 16
\f2NAME*\f1
Text that specifies the package name
(maximum length of 256 ASCII characters).
.TP 16
\f2ARCH*\f1
A comma-separated list of alphanumeric tokens that indicate the architecture
(for example, \f43B2\f1) associated with the package.
The \f4pkgmk\fP
tool may be used to create or modify this value when actually building the
package.
The maximum length of a token is 16 characters and it cannot include a comma.
.TP 16
\f2VERSION*\f1
Text that specifies the current version associated with the software package.
The maximum length is 256 ASCII characters and the first character cannot
be a left parenthesis.
The \f4pkgmk\fP
tool may be used to create or modify this value when actually building the
package.
.TP 16
\f2CATEGORY*\f1
A comma-separated list of categories under which a package may be displayed.
A package must at least belong to the system or application category.
Categories are case-insensitive and may contain only alphanumerics.
Each category is limited in length to 16 characters.
.TP 16
\f2DESC\f1
Text that describes the package (maximum length of 256 ASCII characters).
.TP 16
\f2VENDOR\f1
Used to identify the vendor that holds the software copyright
(maximum length of 256 ASCII characters).
.TP 16
\f2HOTLINE\f1
Phone number and/or mailing address where further information may be received
or bugs may be reported
(maximum length of 256 ASCII characters).
.TP 16
\f2EMAIL\f1
An electronic address where further information is available or bugs may be
reported
(maximum length of 256 ASCII characters).
.TP 16
\f2VSTOCK\f1
The vendor stock number, if any, that identifies this product
(maximum length of 256 ASCII characters).
.TP 16
\f2CLASSES\f1
A space-separated list of classes defined for a package.
The order of the list determines the order in which the classes are installed.
Classes listed first will be installed first (on a media by media basis).
This parameter may be modified by the request script.
.TP 16
\f2ISTATES\f1
A list of allowable run states for package installation (for example,
\f4"S s 1"\f1).
.TP 16
\f2RSTATES\f1
A list of allowable run states for package removal (for example,
\f4"S s 1"\f1).
.TP 16
\f2BASEDIR\f1
The pathname to a default directory where ``relocatable'' files
may be installed.
If blank, the package is not relocatable and any files that have relative
pathnames will not be installed.
An administrator can override the default
directory.
.TP 16
\f2ULIMIT\f1
If set, this parameter is passed as an argument to the
\f4ulimit\fP
command, which establishes the maximum size of a file during installation.
.TP 16
\f2ORDER\f1
A list of classes defining
the order in which they should be put on the medium.
Used by \f4pkgmk\f1
in creating the package.
Classes not defined in this field are placed on the
medium using the standard ordering procedures.
.TP 16
\f2MAXINST\f1
The maximum number of package instances that should be allowed
on a machine at the same time.
By default, only one instance of a package is allowed.
This parameter must be set in order to have multiple
instances of a package.
.TP 16
\f2PSTAMP\f1
Production stamp used to mark the \f4pkgmap\fP file on the output volumes.
Provides a means for distinguishing between production copies of a version if
more than one is in use at a time.
If \f4PSTAMP\f1 is not defined, the default is used.
The default consists of the
.SM UNIX
system machine name followed by the
string \f4"\f2YYMMDDHHMM\f4"\f1 (year, month, date, hour, minutes).
.TP 16
\f2INTONLY\f1
Indicates that the package should only be installed
interactively when set to any non-NULL value.
.TP 16
\f2PREDEPEND\f1
Used to maintain compatibility with pre-SVR4 package dependency checking.
Pre-SVR4 dependency checks were based on whether or not the name file for the
required package existed in the \f4/var/options\f1 directory.
This directory is not maintained for SVR4 packages since the \f4depend\f1
file is used for checking dependencies.
However, entries can be created in this directory to maintain compatibility.
Setting the \f4PREDEPEND\f1 parameter to \f4y\f1 or \f4yes\f1 creates a
\f4/usr/option\f1 entry for the package.
(Packages that are new for SVR4 do not need to use this parameter.)

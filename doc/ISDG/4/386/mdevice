.SH NAME
\f4mdevice\f1  \-  file format.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4mdevice\f1
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \f4mdevice\f1 file is included in the directory \f4/etc/conf/cf.d\f1.
It includes a one-line description of each device driver and configurable
software module in the system to be built
[except for file system types, see \f4mfsys\f1(4)].
Each line in \f4mdevice\f1 represents the \f2Master\f1 file component
from a Driver Software Package (DSP) either delivered with
the base system or installed later via \f4idinstall\f1.
.P
Each line contains several white space-separated fields; they are
described below.
Each field must be supplied with a value or a '\-' (dash).
See the individual driver manual pages for information on the values for
specific fields.
.TP 1i
\f2Device name\f1:
This field is the internal name of the device or module,
and may be up to 8 characters long.
The first character of the name must be an alphabetic character;
the others may be letters, digits, or underscores.
.TP 1i
\f2Function list\f1:
This field is a string of characters that identify
driver functions that are present.
Using one of the characters below requires the driver
to have an entry point (function) of the type indicated.
If no functions in the following list are supplied,
the field should contain a dash.
.RS 1.25i
.TP 4
\f4o\f1 \- open routine
.TP
\f4c\f1 \- close routine
.TP
\f4r\f1 \- read routine
.TP
\f4w\f1 \- write routine
.TP
\f4i\f1 \- ioctl routine

\f4s\f1 \- startup routine

.RE

Note that if the device is a 'block' type device (see field\ 3. below),
a \f2strategy\f1 routine and a \f2print\f1 routine
are required by default.
.TP 1i
\f2Characteristics of driver\f1:
This field contains a set of characters
that indicate the characteristics of the driver.
If none of the characters below apply, the field should contain a dash.
The legal characters for this field are:
.RS 1.25i
.TP \w'O\ \-\ \ 'u
\f4i\f1 \-
The device driver is installable.
.TP
\f4c\f1 \- The device is a 'character' device.
.TP
\f4b\f1 \- The device is a 'block' device.
.TP
\f4[b/c]\f1 \- For indicating which device nodes belong to
which major.  See \f4idmknod\f1.
.TP
\f4f\f1 \- The device is DDI/DKI conformant.
.TP
\f4t\f1 \- The device is a tty.
.TP
\f4o\f1 \- This device may have only one \f2sdevice\f1 entry.
.TP
\f4r\f1 \- This device is required in all configurations of the Kernel.
This option is intended for drivers delivered with the base system only.
Device nodes (special files in the \f4/dev\f1 directory),
once made for this device, are never removed.
See \f4idmknod\f1.
.TP
\f4u\f1 \- This letter accompanying an 'M' would ensure that the
driver will get major numbers starting at the same number for
both block and character "multiple majors".
.TP
\f4S\f1 \- This device driver is a STREAMS module.
.TP
\f4H\f1 \- This device driver controls hardware.
This option distinguishes drivers that support hardware
from those that are entirely software (pseudo-devices).
.TP
\f4G\f1 \- This device does not use an interrupt though an interrupt
is specified in the \f4sdevice\f1 entry.
This is used when you wish to associate a device
to a specific device group.
.TP
\f4D\f1 \- This option indicates that the device driver can share its 
DMA channel.
.TP
\f4M\f1 \- This option indicates that the device requires
multiple major numbers.
.TP
\f4O\f1 \- This option indicates that the IOA range of this device may
overlap that of another device.
.RE
.TP 1i
\f2Handler prefix\f1:
This field contains the character string prepended to all
the externally-known handler routines associated with this driver.
The string may be up to 4 characters long.
.TP 1i
.IR "Block Major number" :
This field should be set to zero in a DSP \f2Master\f1 file.
If the device is a 'block' type device,
a value will be assigned by \f4idinstall\f1 during installation.
For devices having multiple major numbers this field is used
to specify the "range" of major numbers.  (e.g., range 3-6 is
interpreted as four major numbers between 3-6 inclusive).
.TP 1i
.IR "Character Major number" :
This field should be set to zero in a DSP \f2Master\f1 file.
If the device is a 'character' type device (or 'STREAMS' type),
a value will be assigned by \f4idinstall\f1 during installation.
For devices having multiple major numbers this field is used
to specify the "range" of major numbers.  (e.g., range 3-6 is
interpreted as four major numbers between 3-6 inclusive).
.TP 1i
\f2Minimum units\f1:
This field is an integer specifying the minimum number
of these devices that can be specified in the \f4sdevice\f1 file.
.TP 1i
\f2Maximum units\f1:
This field specifies the maximum number of these
devices that may be specified in the \f4sdevice\f1 file.
It contains an integer.
.TP 1i
\f2DMA channel\f1:
This field contains  an integer that specifies
the DMA channel to be used by this device.
If the device does not use DMA, place a '\-1' in this field.
Note that more than one device can share a DMA channel 
(previously disallowed).
.SH "SPECIFYING STREAMS DEVICES AND MODULES"
STREAMS modules and drivers are treated in a slightly different way
from other drivers in all UNIX Systems, and their configuration
reflects this difference.
To specify a STREAMS device driver, its \f4mdevice\f1 entry should
contain both an 'S' and a 'c' in the \f2characteristics\f1 field (see 3. above).
This indicates that it is a STREAMS driver and that it requires an
entry in the UNIX kernel's \f2cdevsw\f1 table, where STREAMS drivers
are normally configured into the system.
.P
A STREAMS module that is not a device driver, such as a line discipline
module, requires an 'S' in the \f2characteristics\f1 field of its
\f4mdevice\f1 file entry, but should not include a 'c', as a device
driver does.

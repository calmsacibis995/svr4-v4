.SH NAME
\f4fmlgrep\f1 \- search a file for a pattern
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4fmlgrep\f1
[\f2options\f1] \f2limited_regular_expression\f1 [\f2file\f1 .\ .\ .]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4fmlgrep\f1 searches \f2file\f1 for a pattern
and prints all lines that contain that pattern.
The
\f4fmlgrep\f1
function uses limited regular expressions
(expressions that have string values that use a subset
of the possible alphanumeric and special characters)
like those used with \f4ed\f1(1) to match the patterns.
It uses a compact non-deterministic algorithm.
.PP
Be careful when using FMLI special characters (for example, \f4$, \(ga, \(aa, "\f1)
in \f2limited_regular_expression\f1.
It is safest to enclose the entire \f2limited_regular_expression\f1
in single quotes
\f4\&\(fm \^.\^.\^.\^ \(fm \|\f1.
.PP
If \f2file\f1 is not specified, \f4fmlgrep\f1 assumes standard input.
Normally, each line matched is copied to standard output.
The file name is printed before each line matched
if there is more than one input file.
.PP
Command line options are:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP 6
\f4-b\f1
Precede each line by the block number on which it was found.
This can be useful in locating block numbers by context
(first block is 0).
.TP
\f4-c\f1
Print only a count of the lines that contain the pattern.
.TP
\f4-i\f1
Ignore upper/lower case distinction during comparisons.
.TP
\f4-l\f1
Print only the names of files with matching lines,
separated by new-lines.
Does not repeat the names of files
when the pattern is found more than once.
.TP
\f4-n\f1
Precede each line by its line number in the file (first line is 1).
.TP
\f4-s\f1
Suppress error messages about nonexistent or unreadable files.
.TP
\f4-v\f1
Print all lines except those that contain the pattern.
.PD
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
\f4fmlgrep\f1 returns the following exit values:
.nf
.sp
0  if the pattern is found (that is, TRUE)
1  if the pattern is not found (that is, FALSE)
2  if an invalid expression was used or \f2file\f1 is inaccessible
.sp
.fi
.SH NOTES
Lines are limited to \s-1BUFSIZ\s+1 characters;
longer lines are truncated.
\s-1BUFSIZ\s+1 is defined in
\f4/usr/include/stdio.h\f1.
.PP
If there is a line with embedded nulls,
\f4fmlgrep\f1
will only match up to the first null;
if it matches, it will print the entire line.

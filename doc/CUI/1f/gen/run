.SH NAME
\f4run\f1 \- run an executable
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4run\f1
[\f4\-s\f1] [\f4\-e\f1] [\f4\-n\f1] [\f4\-t\f1 \f2string\f1] \f2program\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4run\f1 function runs \f2program\f1,
using the PATH variable to find it.
By default,
when \f2program\f1 has completed,
the user is prompted (\f4Press ENTER to continue:\f1),
before being returned to FMLI.
The argument \f2program\f1 is a UNIX system executable followed by its
options (if any).
.TP 4P
\f4\-e\f1
If \f4-e\f1 is specified the user will be prompted before returning
to FMLI only if there is an error condition
.TP
\f4\-n\f1
If \f4-n\f1 is specified the user will never be prompted before returning to FMLI
(useful for programs like \f4vi\f1, in which the user must do
some specific action to exit in the first place).
.TP
\f4\-s\f1
The \f4-s\f1 option means "silent",
implying that the screen will not have to be repainted
when \f2program\f1 has completed.
NOTE: The \f4-s\f1 option should only be used when \f2program\f1
does not write to the terminal.
In addition, when \f4-s\f1 is used, \f2program\f1 cannot be interrupted,
even if it recognizes interrupts.
.TP
\f4\-t\f1 \f2string\f1
If \f4-t\f1 is specified, \f2string\f1 is the name this process will have
in the pop-up menu generated by the \f4frm-list\f1 command.
This feature requires the executable \f4facesuspend\f1, (currently
only available with the FACE product), to suspend the
UNIX system process and return to the FMLI application.
.SH EXAMPLE
Here is a menu that uses \f4run\f1:

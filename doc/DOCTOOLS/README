# README File for Release 1.1 of Documenter's Tool Set

To install this release of DOCTOOLS, follow the
steps outlined below.

PREREQUISITE:
                DOCTOOLS works in conjunction with UNIX System V DWB
                (Documenter's Workbench) software. DWB includes troff, tbl, pic, eqn
                and other tools. DOCTOOLS will work properly with DWB2.0
		(with PostScript software supplied with SVR4) or with DWB3.1
		(which includes PostScript software). We recommend DWB3.1.
		Source products for either version can be purchased from
		UNIX System Laboratories, Inc.
		*** DOCTOOLS will NOT work properly with BSD versions of DWB tools. ***

STEP 1:

Edit the shells/defs.h.src file to tell DOCTOOLS about your
local printers and other destinations.
Follow the examples in the file.
You will need to know how to send jobs to the printers
on your system to define the variables.  If you know
the command line syntax, such as:

	tbl filename |troff -Tpost -mm |dpost |lp -opost -dprinter1

you can edit defs.h.src.  If you do not know this information,
obtain this information from your system administrator.

If you have a pre-1.1 release of DOCTOOLS, you can copy
your existing defs.h to shells/defs.h.src.
Change any occurrences of MACH to MACHINE.
Note, however, that some destinations included in defs.h.src
are meant to be location independent.  These are:

	proof   : proofing files on a DMD terminal.
	null    : processing files to check for errors, or to
	          generate tables of contents.
	post    : creating PostScript files.
	archive : archiving files with cpio

You may need to make some minor adjustments in these
definitions to accommodate your local environment.

STEP 2:

You may or may not need to edit macros/macros.h.src.
This file contains the font specific information
and other tunable variables, like the print date that
appears at the bottom of manpages.
NOTE: Unlike defs.h.src, it is not compatible with
previous versions of DOCTOOLS.

The macros.h.src file holds definitions, in the form
of troff defined strings, for much of the typography
produced by DOCTOOLS.  You can change the definitions
to change the style created by the markup in the text
files, such as the fonts used for user input text,
computer output text, and program code text (see
the macros for .UI, .CO, and .PC in the user's guide).
Try using it as is.  If you have font related
errors, then edit macros.h.src and reinstall.

Follow the comments in the macros.h.src file and make
changes carefully.


STEP 3:

You will need to set the variables described in Makefile.
Makefile contains the variables that set where the tools
are installed as well as set necessary variables
within some of the files themselves. You might want to
change (ROOT) to where you want DOCTOOLS to be installed.
You may also choose to change (BINDIR) and/or (LIBDIR).
Follow the comments in Makefile.

Once you have made these changes, type

	make install

in this directory and watch for any error messages.

MEMORANDUM MACROS NOTE:

If you plan to print memoranda with DOCTOOLS,
copy or link your local memorandum macro file to
a file called mmt in LIBDIR (defined in Makefile).
Make sure any sourced (.so) files in mmt are also
in LIBDIR or that they can be successfully read
in from where they are kept.

PostScript NOTE:

The SVR4 source tape includes a set of PostScript tools
designed to work with Documenter's WorkBench software,
including a troff postprocessor called dpost. 
This tool converts troff to PostScript and
enables you to integrate PostScript graphics files 
into your source text files. This is
described in chapter 4 of the user's guide.

You will find the PostScript software on your 4.0 
source tape in:

	/usr/src/cmd/lp/postscript

You will see references in some of the entries in the
defs.h.src file to -Tpost and dpost.  These entries
are designed to work with this PostScript software.
If you are using DWB3.1, change "Tpost" to "Topost" in
shells/defs.h.src and macros/macros.h.src to retain
the font definitions currently used by USL.

You may also have to quantify "dpost" by a pathname
(or add it to your PATH) so DOCTOOLS can find dpost.

If you have any problems or questions, give me a call
or send mail.

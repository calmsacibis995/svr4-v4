.H 1 "Getting Started"
.IX formatting files
DOCTOOLS provides a single command to process
and print all your documentation files.
This command is called
.UI format .
.P
The
.UI format
command accepts several options to control
.IX format
how you want your files processed.
.IX format options
These options allow you to do the following:
.BL
.LI
Print and save a table of contents for a file being processed.
.LI
Specify a destination, such as a printer.
.LI
Choose to print in landscape, as opposed to portrait, orientation.
.LI
Have mail sent when your file has finished printing.
.LI
Process selected pages, as opposed to all pages, of a file.
.LI
Choose one of seven available page sizes.
.LI
Process a file for a specific version.
.LI
Process the job silently: no messages will be sent to your
screen.
.LE
These options are described at
length in the
.ST "Command Mode"
section below.
.P
You can also invoke
.UI format
without options.
In response,
.UI format
displays its full syntax, presents
a list of locally available destinations,
and prompts you to choose formatting options.
You can at this point choose to be prompted through
selecting a destination, printing selected pages,
and the other available options.
This behavior is described at length in the
.ST "Interactive Mode"
section below.
.P
.UI format
.IX file types
recognizes four types of text files:
.BL
.LI
Manual page files.
.IX manual page files
.LI
Guide files.
.IX guide files
.LI
Memoranda files.
.IX memoranda files
.LI
Collection files.
.IX collection files
.LE
Each of these four types of text files contains a macro
that distinguishes it from the other file types.
This allows
.UI format
to process each of the file types differently and,
conversely, allows you to use
.UI format
to process several different file types.
More detailed information about file types
can be found in the
.ST "File Types"
section below.
.H 1 "Command Mode"
.IX command mode
This section describes the command line syntax supported
by
.UI format .
The following is a synopsis of the

.LE
When you execute
.UI format ,
the following general rules apply:
.IX format behavior
.BL
.LI
Upon encountering an unsupported option,
.UI format
issues a warning and prints a synopsis of the command line options.
.LI
Any argument not beginning with "\-" is interpreted
as an input file;
.UI format
issues a warning and ignores the input if this is not the case.
.LI
Formatting options apply uniformly to all files being processed.
This means, for example, that if you choose
to print in landscape as opposed to portrait page orientation,
all the files specified on the command line will print in
landscape orientation.
.LE
Each of the command mode options is described below.
.H 2 "Table of Contents: The \-c Option"
The
.UI \-c
.IX -c option
.IX tables of contents
option creates and prints a table of contents
for the file(s) being processed.
.UI format
can generate and print three types of tables of contents:
.BL
.LI
Chapter table of contents for a chapter of guide material.
.IX chapter tables of contents
.LI
Master table of contents for a book of guide material.
.IX master tables of contents
.LI
Reference manual table of contents (and permuted index)
.IX permuted index
for a book of manual pages.
.LE
The following sections describe each of these tables of contents.
.H 3 "Chapter Table of Contents"
.IX chapter tables of contents
In most cases, you use the
.UI \-c
option to create and print a
chapter table of contents file for
a guide text file, for example, a chapter of a user's guide.
If you have a guide text file called
.UI chap1
and you execute the command:
.UI
format -d printer1 -c chap1
.SF
.UI format
will create a file called
.UI Cchap1 ,
that would contain the table of contents for the chapter;
also,
.UI format
will print the table of contents on
.UI printer1
with
.UI chap1 .
.P
The chapter table of contents file that
.UI format
creates is no different than any other guide text file;
so it can be processed by
.UI format
just as you would process any text file.
For example, if you wanted to print
.UI Cchap1
on its own,
you would enter:
.UI
format -d printer1 Cchap1
.SF
A table of contents file contains the chapter and book titles specified
in its associated guide text file; and it contains
the headings, figure, and table legends found in
the chapter along with their page numbers.
.UI format
also uses the chapter table of contents
files to record the indexing entries and page numbers
from the guide file.
These are used by the indexing program when you
prepare an index for the book, as is discussed in chapter 6.
.P
If you want to have
.UI format
create a chapter table of contents file
every time you process a guide file, you can do
so by setting an environment variable called
.UI STOC
.IX STOC variable
.IX variables, STOC
equal to
.UI Y .
You can set
.UI STOC
to
.UI Y
by including the following line in your
.UI \&.profile :
.IX \&.profile
.UI
STOC=Y; export STOC
.SF
This means you will not need to specify
.UI \-c
to save a table of contents file; however,
you will still need to specify
.UI \-c
when you want to print
a table of contents file while printing its associated guide file.
.H 3 "Master Table of Contents"
.IX master tables of contents
A master table of contents is a
table of contents that appears at the beginning of a
book of guide material, as opposed to at the beginning of a chapter.
.UI format
generates a master table of contents file called
.UI MasterToc
.IX MasterToc file
from a set of chapter table of contents files.
You can specify on the command line the chapter table of contents
file names to
.UI format
in their printing order, as shown here:
.UI
format -d printer1 -c Cchap1 Cchap2 Cchap3 CappA
.SF
Or, you can create a collection file with the chapter
.IX collection files
table of contents files listed in their printing
order, one per line, as shown here:
.UI
\&.FT
Cchap1
Cchap2
Cchap3
CappA
.SF
This feature is especially useful when you have a lot
of chapter table of contents files.
You could then specify the collection file
name to
.UI format ,
as shown here for a collection file named
.UI master.col :
.UI
format -d printer1 -c master.col
.SF
For more information on
collection files see the 
.ST "File Types"
section later in this chapter, or turn to chapter 5.
.P
A master table of contents file,
like a chapter table of contents file,
simply contains macros and text; it can, therefore, be printed
like any other text file, as in the following example:
.UI
format -d printer1 MasterToc
.SF
A master table of contents will include the chapter titles
and first-level headings from a book and a list of all
the figure and table legends.
.H 3 "Reference Manual Table of Contents and Permuted Index"
.IX permuted index
.IX reference manual table of contents
If you create a collection file listing
manual page files, you can use
.UI "format \-c"
to create and print a table of contents and permuted
index for the manual pages.
For example, if you have a reference manual called the
.BT "Programmer's Reference Manual" ,
and you created a collection file called
.UI progman.col
listing all the manual pages in the manual
in their printing order,
you could then execute:
.UI
format -d printer1 -c progman.col
.SF
.UI format
would create two files:
.UI TC.progman.col ,
a table of contents file for the reference manual; and
.UI PI.program.col ,
a permuted index file for the reference manual.
It would also print these files on
.UI printer1 .
.P
The table of contents and permuted index files for a reference
manual, unlike the table of contents files for a guide,
contain each manual page name, along with a brief description,
for all the manual page files listed in the collection file.
Like the other table of contents files, however, they consist
of macros and text and can be printed at any time without
further processing.
.H 2 "Destinations: The \-d Option"
.IX destinations
.IX -d option
The
.UI \-d
.SB destination
option specifies where you want your job printed, or
if you want your job processed but not printed.
Unlike
.UI \-c ,
you must specify an argument with
.UI \-d
to indicate the name of a valid destination.
However, if you do not specify
.UI \-d
.SB destination
when executing
.UI format ,
your file(s) will be processed for a default destination.
This default destination is set by your system administrator;
.IX default destination
.IX destination, default
you can, however, override the system default by setting
the environment variable
.UI DEFDEST
.IX DEFDEST variable
.IX variables, DEFDEST
equal to one of the valid destination names.
.P
To display the list of valid destination names as well
as the current default (which will be your default
if you have set
.UI DEFDEST ,
otherwise the system default)
execute
.UI format
without arguments, as shown in the following figure.
.FG "Displaying Valid Destinations"
.SS
$ format

        ruby lino proof null post archive
        Default is: apple

Choose Formatting Options? (y/n): 

$
.SE
If you specify an invalid destination,
.UI format
will produce an error message and display the command syntax with the list
of valid destinations.
.P
For the most part, the list of valid destinations is
location dependent.
The number, types, and names of printers varies tremendously
from location to location.
The following four destinations, however, are not printer
destinations; they are, therefore, meant to be location independent.
.VL "" "" UI
.LI proof
.IX proof destination
prepares file(s) to be previewed on a bitmap (DMD) terminal.
.P
This destination invokes the program
.UI proof ,
enabling file(s) to appear in a window on your DMD terminal
with the same line and page breaks as if you had printed
the file(s) on your local laser printer.
.UI format
creates a
.UI troff
output file named
.UI prf.\f2filename\fP .
.LI null
.IX null destination
processes file(s) to
.UI /dev/null ;
the file(s) are processed through
.UI troff ,
but the output from
.UI troff
is thrown away.
.P
This destination is often used when you want to create
a table of contents file but you do not want to print
either it or the text file from which is was generated.
.LI post
.IX post destination
creates a PostScript language file named
.UI ps.\f2filename\fP .
.P
This destination is dependent on local PostScript
postprocessing to translate the
.UI troff
output files into a PostScript output file.
Its primary use is to create a file that can be
included in a text file using the
.UI \&.BP
macro.
See chapter 4 for a description of the
.UI \&.BP
macro.
.AB N
You can only specify a single filename when using
the
.UI post
destination.
Also, since you are using this option to generate
a picture for inclusion in another file, you can not
generate a picture greater than one page in length.
.AC
.LI archive
.IX archive destination
creates a
.UI cpio
file for storage or shipment.
.P
This destination allows you to create a
.UI cpio
.IX cpio
.IX archive files
archive file from a collection file.
For example, if you have a collection file named
.UI uguide.col ,
you could specify the following to create a
.UI cpio
file that archives all the files listed in
.UI uguide.col :
.UI
format -d archive uguide.col
.SF
The
.UI cpio
file created would be named
.UI cpio.uguide.col .
Also, you would be sent mail listing the contents
of the
.UI cpio
file.
.AB N
The
.UI archive
destination can only be used with collection files.
.AC
.LE
.H 2 "Page Orientation: The \-l Option"
.IX page orientation
.IX -l option
The
.UI \-l
option allows you to print a job in landscape orientation (the
page is turned 90 degrees).
By default, jobs are printed in portrait orientation.
.IX portrait orientation
.IX landscape orientation
This option will be ignored if the destination does
not support printing in landscape orientation.
.P
Individual pages of a job can be printed in landscape orientation
by combining this option with the
.UI \-o
option described below.
A single job can not, however, print some pages in portrait orientation
and some pages in landscape orientation.
.H 2 "Confirmation Mail: The \-m Option"
.IX confirmation mail
.IX -m option
The
.UI \-m
option informs
.UI format
to send you mail once your job has finished printing.
This option will be ignored if the local job spooling
program does not support an option to send mail.
.H 2 "Selected Pages:  The \-o Option"
.IX selected pages
.IX -o option
The
.UI \-o
.SB pages
option allows you to process only specified pages of a job.
.P
Valid page number specifications are the same as
those accepted by the
.UI \-o
flag to
.UI troff .
This includes comma-separated page numbers
(for example, 2,4,8,9), dash-separated page ranges (for example, 2-4,6-10),
the use of an initial dash to indicate all pages from
the beginning-of-file to a specified page (for example, -10,13),
and the use of a final dash to indicate all pages from
a specified page to end-of-file (2,4,6-).
.AB N
Since the
.UI \-o
option causes
.UI troff
to process only part of a file,
no table of contents file will be generated when using
this option, even if you specify
.UI \-c .
.AC
.H 2 "Starting Page Number: The \-p Option"
.IX page numbering
.IX -p option
The
.UI \-p
.SB page
option allows you
to begin page numbering with any number you specify.
.P
By default, page numbering begins with page 1.
This option allows any number to be specified
as the starting point for a job's page numbering.
.H 2 "Page Size: The \-s Option"
.IX page size
.IX -s option
The
.UI \-s
.SB size
option allows you to process a job for a specified page size.
.P
Seven page sizes are supported.
The default size is 6.25 inches
by 8.5 inches.
All available printing sizes are shown in the following
table with their corresponding
.SB size
argument.

.TE
.H 2 "Version Control: The \-v Option"
.IX version control
.IX -v option
The
.UI \-v
.SB version
option allows you to process a job for a specified version.
.P
This option is used in conjunction with the version
control macros:
.UI \&.VS
.IX \&.VS macro
and
.UI \&.VE .
.IX \&.VE macro
By default, version 1 of a job will be
processed, if version control macros are present in the file(s).
To process a job for another version,
this option must be used and the version must
be specified.
Use
.UI "\-v all"
to process a job for all versions.
.P
See chapter 4 for information on the version control
macros.
.H 2 "Silent Processing: The \-w Option"
.IX silent processing
.IX -w option
The
.UI \-w
option allows you to withhold all screen messages, except errors.
.P
Messages normally sent to the screen will instead be sent
via mail.
This allows a job to be processed in the background
without messages from
.UI format
interfering with subsequent work.
.H 2 "Less Visible Manual Page Parameters: The \-r Options"
.IX manual page options
.IX reference manual options
The following options provide greater control
over the processing of manual page files:
.UI -rC1
and
.UI -rS\&\f2section\f1 .
These options are not widely used, so they
are not as well advertised as the options described above.
.P
If you specify
.UI -rC1
when processing a group of manual pages, they
will print with continuous page numbering.
.IX continuous page numbering
.IX -rC1 option
By default, manual pages reset the starting page number to 1.
This option is valuable when printing groups of manual
pages as chapters in a book.
.P
If you specify
.UI -rS\&\f2section\f1 ,
.IX -rS option
when processing a manual page, the folio in the running
.IX manual page section number
footer will print as
.SB section\-page ,
for example, 8-1.
By default, no section number is printed.
.AB N
You can only specify numbers for
.SB section .
.AC
.H 1 "Interactive Mode"
.IX interactive mode
As shown in Figure 2-1,
if you invoke
.UI format
without options
.UI format
displays a usage message,
a list of available destinations,
and the following prompt: 
.UI

.H 1 "File Types"
.IX file types
This section describes the file types that
.UI format
recognizes.
As described earlier,
.UI format
recognizes four types of text files:
.BL
.LI
Manual page files.
.IX manual page files
.LI
Guide files.
.IX guide files
.LI
Memoranda files.
.IX memoranda files
.LI
Collection files.
.IX collection files
.LE
Each of the file types is described briefly below.
.P
File types are distinguished by the macros with which they
are coded.
Some macros are common to several file types;
for instance, the
.UI \&.P
macro for specifying the start of
a paragraph is common to manual page files, expository text files,
and Memorandum Macros files.
Other macros, however, are unique and allow
.UI format
to identify source text files and to process them according
to their file type.
.P
In the absence of a unique identifier, 
.IX unique file identifiers
.UI format
causes processing to default
to that for a guide file.
.H 2 "Manual Page Files"
.IX manual page files
A manual page file normally provides complete, but terse
technical information about the form and functionality
of an individual command, file format, special file, system
call, subroutine, or the like.
.P
.UI format
recognizes an input file coded with
.UI man (5)
.IX man (5) macros
macros as a manual page text file.
.UI format
uses
.UI \&.TH
.IX \&.TH macro
.SB manual-page-name
as the identifier.
.P
See chapter 3 for a complete description of the manual page macros.
.H 2 "Guide Files"
.IX guide files
A guide file might be a chapter in a user's guide,
a primer, a reference card, or some other type of
technical documentation that
explains and illustrates the features of a product.
.P
.UI format
recognizes
an input file coded with expository text macros
as a guide text file.
.UI format
uses
.UI \&.CH
.IX \&.CH macro
.SB chapter-title
as the identifier.
.P
See chapter 4 for a complete description of the guide macros.
.H 2 "Memoranda Files"
.IX memoranda files
Business letters, as well as technical requirements documents
and engineer's notes,
are often written in the format of memoranda, using the
Memoranda Macros.
.P
.UI format
recognizes an input file
coded with
.UI mm (5)
.IX mm (5) macros
macros as a Memorandum Macros source text file.
.UI format
uses
.UI \&.MT
.IX \&.MT macro
as the identifier.
.P
The
.UI mm
macros are not distributed with DOCTOOLS.
Consult the
.BT "DOCUMENTER'S WORKBENCH\s-2\(tm\s0 Software User's Guide"
for more information on the Memoranda Macros.
.H 2 "Collection Files" 
.IX collection files
Unlike a source text file, a collection file contains a list of 
source text file names that the user wants to process together
as one job.
An example of a collection file is one that
lists all of a book's source text files in their printing order;
the collection file name could then be specified to
.UI format
enabling you to print the entire book in a single step.
.P
.UI format
recognizes an input file
coded with the
.UI \&.FT
.IX \&.FT macro
macro as a collection file.
.P
See chapter 5 for more information on collection files.
.H 1 "Source Code Controlled Files"
Documenter's Tool Set can process files stored under
the Source Code Control System (SCCS).
Two environment variables locate your local SCCS
file structure for DOCTOOLS:
.UI SCCSSRC
and
.UI ARCSRC .
.UI SCCSSRC
is a path identifying where your active SCCS files
are kept; and
.UI ARCSRC
is a path identifying where your inactive,
or archived, SCCS files are kept.
These variables
should have been defined by your system administrator
when the tools were installed.
You can, however, set them yourself in your own environment and thereby override
the system definition.
.P
.UI SCCSSRC
and
.UI ARCSRC
are normally set to the root, or final common point,
of a file system or directory structure
before the directory structure for your SCCS files
branches out.
For instance,
.UI SCCSSRC
might be set to
.UI /usr/local/sccs
and under the
.UI /usr/local/sccs
directory there might be
10 directories, each directory containing
SCCS text files specific to a particular book or project.
If one of the subdirectories were named
.UI uguide
and in
.UI uguide
there was a file called
.UI s.chap1
(SCCS source text files are prefixed with s.), you could
use
\%\f4format\f1
to print this file by specifying:
.UI
format -dprinter1 uguide/chap1
.SF
.AB N
Even though the SCCS file that
.UI format
will find and process is named
.UI s.chap1 ,
you only need to specify
.UI chap1.
The SCCS prefix,
.UI s\&. ,
is automatically prefixed to the filename you
specify.
.AC
.UI format
checks three locations for the filename(s) you specify;
and it checks them in the following order:
.AL
.LI
\f3Local Directory Structure\f1 \- The presence of a file in your
local directory/file structure overrides its
presence stored under SCCS.
In this example,
.UI format
would look for a directory called
.UI uguide
and in it a file called
.UI chap1.
.LI
\f3Active SCCS Directory Structure\f1 \- If
.UI format
fails to find the specified file locally,
it searches for it in
.UI $SCCSSRC .
In most cases, you will need to precede the
filename with a directory name, as in this example, since
.UI $SCCSSRC
will most likely contain subdirectories, not files.
In this example,
.UI format
would look for a directory called
.UI uguide
under
.UI $SCCSSRC ,
and in it a file named
.UI s.chap1 .
If
.UI s.chap1
is found, the top delta (the most
recent version of the file) will be retrieved
and processed.
.LI
\f3Archive SCCS Directory Structure\f1 \- If
.UI format
fails to find the named file in the first two locations,
it will then look in
.UI $ARCSRC .
Since books change from one release to another,
it's common for filenames to change and/or disappear.
To protect against your trying to reprint an old
version of a book only to find that the SCCS
files no longer match up or no longer exist, the
files can be archived in
.UI $ARCSRC
and 
.UI format
will find them there after searching locally
and in 
.UI $SCCSRC
first.
.LE
.H 1 "Error Messages"
There are several different types of error
messages generated by DOCTOOLS.
Most of the error messages attempt to interpret
which kind of error has occurred and supply you
with some information to remedy the situation.
For example, if
.UI format
fails to find the file you named
or if the file you named is not readable,
.UI format
will send a message to your screen telling you:
.CO
Input file \(**\(**\(** \f2filename\fP \(**\(**\(** Not Found
.SF
or
.CO
Input file \(**\(**\(** \f2filename\fP \(**\(**\(** Not Readable 
.SF
.P
Error messages related to the macros will fall into one of two
categories:  fatal or non-fatal.
A fatal error is one that terminates processing immediately.
An example of a fatal error is:
.DS "" CO
****************************************************
FATAL ERROR:(testfile1) troff line 8
LIST ERROR: 1 UNENDED LIST(S) BEFORE HEADING - .H 2 Conventions 
PROCESSING TERMINATED
****************************************************
.DE
A non-fatal error is one that alerts you to a potential
problem with your file.
An example of a non-fatal error is:
.DS "" CO
****************************************************
NON-FATAL ERROR:(testfile2) troff line 2
BK: Missing Argument 1, Book Title
PROCESSING WILL CONTINUE
****************************************************
.DE
If you encounter a macro error with one of your files and
you are not sure where or what the problem is, run
.UI checkmacs
on the file to help pinpoint the problem.
.P
In general, if an error message appears on your screen
and you are not sure how to interpret it, ask
your system administrator.

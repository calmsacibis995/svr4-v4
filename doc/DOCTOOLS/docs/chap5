.H 1 "Introduction"
.IX collection files
.IX files types
DOCTOOLS recognizes a fourth file type: a collection file.
Unlike manual page source files, guide source files,
and memoranda source files,
a collection file contains a list of file names
that you want processed together as a single job.
For example, you could use a collection file to 
list all the files that compose a book; you could then
print the book, from cover to cover, in a single
step by specifying only the collection file name to
.UI format .
.P
As you will see in the next section,
the structure of collection files is simple
but distinctive.
Common to all collection files is the
.UI \&.FT
macro.
The
.UI \&.FT
macro marks a file as a collection file which,
in turn, enables
.UI format
to process collection files differently than manual page
files, guide files, and memoranda files.
.H 1 "Collection File Structure"
.IX collection file structure
A collection file consists of the
.UI \&.FT
.IX \&.FT macro
.IX collection file macro, \&.FT
macro followed by a list of file names, one per line,
in their order of printing.
Figure 5-1 shows a collection file for a book 
containing chapters 1, 2, and 3, appendix A,
and associated table of contents files.
The
.UI MasterToc
file contains the master table of contents for the book;
.IX master table of contents file
therefore it is listed first.
Also, preceding each chapter file is its associated
chapter table of contents file; for example,
file
.UI chap1
is preceded by file
.UI Cchap1 ,
which was created when
.UI chap1
was processed through
.UI format
with the
.UI -c
option.

When you process the collection file through
.UI format ,
confirmation mail listing the files that were found in the collection
will be sent to you upon completion.
.P
If you are using a collection file
to record all the files that compose a book
so that you can process the book in one step, as shown
above, you might find it useful to include the
.UI \&.BK
macro to specify the title of the book.
This will help in two ways: it will immediately
identify which book the collection file is used to print;
and it will be used in the confirmation mail to further
identify which collection file
.UI format
processed.
Figure 5-2 includes a
.UI \&.BK
in a collection file.
.H 2 "The \&.FT Macro"
As shown in Figure 5-1, the
.UI \&.FT
macro identifies a file as a collection file
so that
.UI format
knows how to process it.
There are no arguments to the macro.
Its sole use is to act as a file type marker,
indicating to
.UI format
to process the file as a collection.
.P
You can put the
.UI \&.FT
macro anywhere in the collection file.
However, it is good practice to put it at
or towards the top of the file so that others
will easily recognize the file as a collection file.
.H 2 "Delta Numbers"
.IX delta numbers
.IX SCCS files
Chapter 2 describes how
.UI format
can print files that are stored under a Source
Code Control System (SCCS).
It is possible in a collection file to specify exactly which version
of a file you want to process for a file stored under
SCCS.
By default, the top delta (the most recently stored version) of
a file will be processed by
.UI format .
However, if you follow the file name with a TAB and a
valid delta number,
.UI format
will process the specified version of the file.
Figure 5-2 shows how the collection file shown in Figure 5-1
might appear if delta numbers were specified.

The path preceding the file names is there to
illustrate that these files, unlike the ones in 
Figure 5-1, will be found in a source code
directory tree.
This directory tree could be anything; it could
even be in your local file system.
What actually happens is that
.UI format
first looks for a file, such as MasterToc,
in the named directory, or in your local directory
if there is no path specified, as shown in Figure 5-1.
If it does not find it there, it precedes
the named path with a source code path defined
in an environment variable called
.UI SCCSSRC .
.IX SCCSSRC environment variable
.IX environment variable, SCCSSRC
.UI format
then looks for a source file called
.UI s.MasterToc
in
.UI $SCCSSRC/marbles/src ;
and, if you specified a delta number, that particular
version will be printed.
See chapter 2 for more information on printing
SCCS files.
.P
Including delta numbers in a collection file provides
you with a simple and effective mechanism for printing and recording
the exact contents of a book.
For example, it you use a collection file to print
the final version for release 2.0 of a user's guide,
and six months later you need to reprint all or part of
it or you need to ship those particular files to a
customer so that they can reprint the book, you have
retained all the information you need in the collection
file to meet these requests.
Even if you are now printing
release 3.0, you have stored the delta numbers of all
the files that composed release 2.0.
Moreover, you could use that very collection file
to reprint or recreate that earlier release in
a single step.
.H 1 "Collection File Types"
.IX collection file types
A collection file can list source files of
all four types: manual page files, guide files,
memoranda files, and even other collection files.
Also, you can mix file types in a collection file.
For example, a reference manual containing mostly
manual page files might also contain some guide
files for introductory material, table of contents,
and the like.
Even though these two file types process differently,
.UI format
automatically processes each file according to its
file type so that any differences remain transparent to you.
.P
In addition to processing groups of files in one step,
collection files also enable you to create
a permuted index and table of contents for a book
of manual pages and to create a master table of contents
for a book of guide files.
These collection files are described in the next two sections.
.H 2 "Manual Page Collection Files"
.IX manual page collection files
Reference manuals often begin with a permuted index
and table of contents to simplify the process
of locating a manual page.
To create a permuted index file and a table of contents
.IX permuted index
.IX reference manual table of contents
file for a book of manual pages, you need
to create a collection file listing all the manual pages
for the book in their printing order.
You would then process the collection file with
.UI format
using the
.UI \-c
option.
The
.UI \-c
option indicates to
.UI format
that you do not want to print all the files in the collection
file; instead, you want
.UI format
to create and print a permuted index file and a table of
contents file.
The information needed to create these
files is taken from the listed manual page files.
Two files will be created and printed:
\f4PI\f1.\f2collection-file-name\f1 for the permuted index and
\f4TC\f1.\f2collection-file-name\f1 for the table of contents.
.P
You can use the same collection file to create
the permuted index and table of contents files as you
would use to print the book; files that are not manual
pages, such as an introductory chapter, will be ignored.
.H 2 "Master Table of Contents Collection Files"
Just as you can create a table of contents file for
a reference manual, you can create a master table
of contents file for a guide.
Instead of listing manual pages in your collection file,
however, you would list the chapter table of contents
files in their printing order, as shown in Figure 5-3.

When you process this collection file with
.UI format
and use the
.UI \-c
option,
.UI format
will create and print a file called
.UI MasterToc .
The
.UI MasterToc
file is a subset of the headings found in the
.IX master table of contents
chapter table of contents file and it includes
a table of all figure and table legends
found in the book.

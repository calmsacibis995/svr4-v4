.IX product overview
.IX overview
Documenter's Tool Set, abbreviated as DOCTOOLS, simplifies
the task of previewing and printing text files used in
the production of user's guides, reference manuals, primers,
reference cards, and other forms of technical documentation.
DOCTOOLS implements a typesetting
specification, which is a full typographical description
of individual page layout and overall book composition.
The typesetting specification defines the page dimensions and
layout of books comprising expository text and/or manual pages.
.P
The development of DOCTOOLS represents an effort to
address problems, inconsistencies, and deficiencies
in the tools used to 
produce technical documentation in the
UNIX\s-2\(rg\s0 system environment.
At the same time, DOCTOOLS makes use of recent advances in document production
technology, the most significant of which is the development and
proliferation of the PostScript\s-2\(rg\s0 page description language.
.H 2 "Text Processing in a UNIX System Environment"
.IX text processing
UNIX system document production begins with the creation
and/or editing of a text file and completes with the text
file printing on an output device, most often
a local laser printer or perhaps the user's terminal.
The text file, such as the file for this chapter,
consists of lines of text that the author wishes to see printed
interspersed with formatting codes called macros that specify
how the text should appear when printed.
.IX macros
For example, one macro might identify a word
or a series of words to print in an italic font,
while another macro might identify a block of text to be
centered on the page.
.P
A text-formatting program called
.UI troff
.IX troff
translates the
source text file by interpreting the formatting codes,
applying the instructions to the surrounding text,
and producing detailed, device-independent code specifying
exactly how the text will print on each page.
This device-independent code is then translated
.IX PostScript
into device-specific code, such as PostScript language statements,
by a
.UI troff
postprocessor.
This device-specific code is then transmitted to a printer
for its translation to page image.
.P
The sequential translation process described above, which may also include
preprocessing files to format tables, equations, pictures,
.IX preprocessing
and graphs, remains largely invisible to the user.
Instead, the user interacts with this process by
selecting which macros (pre-defined formatting
instructions) to include in his or her file
and on which output device (for example, printer, screen, typesetter, and so
on)
the file should be printed.
The number and type of macros available for use in a file
largely determine the extent to which a writer can control how his or her
document will appear when printed.
Also, the consistent use of a set of macros to produce
a collection of documents effects a much wanted consistency
both in the structure of document source files and
in the typographical output these source files produce.
In sum, macros represent the starting point and the focal
point in the whole translation process from source text
file to printed output.
.P
Many tools have been written over the past
10 to 12 years to facilitate the formatting and printing
of UNIX system text files; the Memorandum Macros,
.IX mm macros
.IX macros, mm
its associated print command
.UI mm (1)
and macro
checking program
.UI checkmm (1),
is one such set of tools.
Documenter's Tool Set will provide the same basic
service, but geared specifically for the production
of technical documentation, such as user's guides,
reference manuals, primers, reference cards, and 
the like.
.H 2 "DOCTOOLS and the Local Environment"
DOCTOOLS requires integration into an existing UNIX system document production
environment.
.IX requirements
In addition to requiring Release 2.0 or later of Documenter's
.IX DWB
Workbench\s-2\(tm\s0 (DWB), which includes such programs as device-independent
.UI troff
(\f4ditroff\fP),
.UI tbl ,
.UI pic ,
.UI eqn ,
and
.UI grap ,
a UNIX text editor, such as
.UI vi
or
.UI ed ,
is needed.
.IX troff
.IX tbl
.IX pic
.IX eqn
.IX grap
.IX vi
.IX ed
Printer specific programs and files, that handle
the translation of device-independent
.UI troff
code
into printer-specific code, are also required.
This information will vary from location to location,
considering the multiplicity of printing and proofing devices currently
used in UNIX document production environments.
.P
Emphasis has been placed on developing DOCTOOLS to work with
.UI troff ,
as opposed to having it work with both
.UI nroff
and
.UI troff .
The functionality of many of the macros
and much of the typography they produce could at best
be crudely estimated with
.IX nroff
.UI nroff ;
the decision was
made, therefore, to limit
.UI nroff 's
applicability to the formatting and printing of manual page files.
This allows manual page files to be stored as on-line
documentation that users can simply print to their screen,
regardless of the type of screen they have.
.H 2 "A Feature Description of DOCTOOLS"
.IX feature description
Documenter's Tool Set comprises three logical components.
.BL
.LI
The first component is a shell command called 
.UI format
.IX format
that processes
and prints four types of source text files:
manual page files, guide files, memoranda files, and
.IX manual page files
.IX guide files
.IX memoranda files
.IX collection files
.IX files, manual pages
.IX files, guides
.IX files, memoranda
.IX files, collections
collection files.
Several options provide control over how a job is
processed and where it is printed.
See chapter 2,
.CT "Formatting Files,"
for a complete discussion of processing and printing text
files.
.P
There is also a shell command called
.UI index
that translates indexing data into a guide file
.IX index
that can be processed with
.UI format .
See chapter 6,
.CT "How to Produce an Index"
for information on creating and printing indexes.
.LI
The second component is a set of macro definitions that
translate the high-level formatting codes contained in a source text
.IX macro files
.IX files, macros
file into the low-level formatting primitives understood
by
.UI troff .
See chapters 3, 4, and 5
for more information on the macro definitions.
.LI
The third component is a file checking program called
.UI checkmacs
that scans a source text file for incorrect or incomplete
.IX checkmacs
.IX macro checking program
usage of macros and checks for errors in file preprocessing.
.LE
Documenter's Tool Set accepts a large base of existing
documentation source files as input to be processed and printed.
This is because it builds on two existing macro packages:
.IX text files
.UI man (5)
for the production of manual pages;
.IX man (5)
and
.UI docmacs
for the production of guides.
.IX docmacs
Files coded with Memorandum Macros are also accepted as input; however,
.IX mm
.IX MM
.IX memoranda macros
the MM macros are not included with DOCTOOLS.
.P
The following figures present all the macros
defined in DOCTOOLS: manual page specific macros,
guide specific macros,
and the macro used to identify collection files.
All macros defined in DOCTOOLS are specified by
a dot(.) followed by one or two upper case letters.
Macro names enclosed by parentheses are synonyms.

.H 1 "Documentation Overview"
.IX documentation overview
.H 2 "Intended Audience"
.IX intended audience
A wide variety of people use DOCTOOLS; and,
accordingly, experience with UNIX system text processing
and document production varies considerably.
Many users are technical writers,
editors, text processors, and production specialists.
DOCTOOLS attempts to accommodate all of these users
regardless of their experience by offering a simple
to use, but comprehensive shell interface along
with macros ranging from the simple to the complex.
.P
The administrator for DOCTOOLS might be the System
.IX administration
Administrator for a UNIX system, or a user
installing a personal copy in his or her local
directory structure.
Administration for DOCTOOLS
is minimal; most of the work involves installing the tools initially
.IX installation
and, to a lesser extent, adapting the tools to accommodate subsequent changes
in the document production environment, such as
the addition of a new printer.
The inclusion of a makefile should simplify installation.
However, to make the necessary choices
in customizing the tools for a particular environment,
the administrator should possess a rudimentary knowledge
of UNIX text processing programs and, specifically,
some familiarity with
.UI troff
and knowledge of
the printing devices that will be known to DOCTOOLS.

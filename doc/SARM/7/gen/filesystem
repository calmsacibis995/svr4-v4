.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX "filesystem" "" "file system organization"
.IX "filesystem" "" "file system layout"
The System V file system tree is organized for administrative convenience.
Distinct areas within the file system tree are provided for files that
are private to one machine, files that can be shared by multiple
machines of a common architecture, files that can be shared
by all machines, and home directories.
This organization allows sharable files to be stored
on one machine but accessed by many machines using a
remote file access mechanism such as RFS or NFS.
Grouping together similar files makes the
file system tree easier to upgrade and manage.
.P
The file system tree consists of a root file system and a collection
of mountable file systems.
The \f4mount\f1(1M)
program attaches mountable file systems to the
file system tree at mount points (directory entries)
in the root file system or other previously mounted file systems.
Two file systems,
\f4/\f1
(the root) and
\f4/usr\f1,
must be mounted in order to have a completely functional system.
The root file system is mounted automatically by the kernel at boot time; the
\f4/usr\f1
file system is mounted by the
\f4/etc/rc.boot\f1
script, which is run as part of the booting process.
.P
The root file system contains files that are unique
to each machine.
It contains the following directories:
.TP 1.15i
\f4/dev\f1
Character and block special files.
These device files provide hooks into
hardware devices or operating system facilities.
Typically, device files are built to match the kernel and hardware
configuration of the machine.
.TP
\f4/dev/term\f1
Terminal devices.
.TP
\f4/dev/pts\f1
Pseudo-terminal devices.
.TP
\f4/dev/xt\f1
Devices used by 
\f4layers.\f1
.TP
\f4/dev/sxt\f1
Shell layers device files used by 
\f4shl.\f1
.TP
\f4/etc\f1
Machine-specific administrative configuration files and system administration 
databases.
\f4/etc\f1
may be viewed
as the home directory of a machine,
the directory that in a sense
defines the machine's identity.
Executable programs are no longer kept in
\f4/etc\f1.
.TP
\f4/home\f1
Root of a subtree for user directories.
.TP
\f4/mnt\f1
Temporary mount point for file systems.
This is an empty directory
on which file systems may be temporarily mounted.
.TP
\f4/opt\f1
Root of a subtree for add-on application packages.
.TP
\f4/proc\f1
Root of a subtree for the process file system.
.TP
\f4/sbin\f1
Essential executables used in the booting process and in manual
system recovery.
The full complement of utilities is available
only after
\f4/usr\f1
is mounted,
.TP
\f4/tmp\f1
Temporary files; initialized to empty during the boot operation.
.TP
\f4/var\f1
Root of a subtree for varying files.
Varying files are files that are unique to a machine
but that can grow to an arbitrary (that is, variable) size.
An example is a log file.
.TP
\f4/var/adm\f1
System logging and accounting files.
.TP
\f4/var/cron\f1
\f4cron\f1's log file.
.TP
\f4/var/mail\f1
Where users' mail is kept.
.TP
\f4/var/opt\f1
Top-level directory used by application packages.
.TP
\f4/var/preserve\f1
Backup files for
\f4vi\f1(1)
and
\f4ex\f1(1).
.TP
\f4/var/spool\f1
Subdirectories for files used in printer spooling, mail delivery,
\f4cron\f1(1),
\f4at\f1(1),
etc.
.TP
\f4/var/tmp\f1
Transitory files; initialized to empty during the boot operation.
.P
Because it is desirable to keep the root file system small and not volatile,
on disk-based systems larger file systems are often mounted on
\f4/home\f1,
\f4/opt\f1,
\f4/usr\f1,
and
\f4/var\f1.
.P
The file system mounted on
\f4/usr\f1
contains architecture-dependent and architecture-independent sharable files.
The subtree rooted at
\f4/usr/share\f1
contains architecture-independent sharable files;
the rest of the
\f4/usr\f1
tree contains architecture-dependent files.
By mounting a common remote file system,
a group of machines with a common architecture
may share a single
\f4/usr\f1
file system.
A single
\f4/usr/share\f1
file system can be shared by machines of any architecture.
A machine acting as a file server may export many different
\f4/usr\f1
file systems to support several different architectures
and operating system releases.
Clients usually mount
\f4/usr\f1
read-only so that they don't accidentally change any shared files.
The
\f4/usr\f1
file system contains the following subdirectories:
.TP 1.15i
\f4/usr/bin\f1
Most system utilities.
.TP
\f4/usr/sbin\f1
Executables for system administration.
.TP
\f4/usr/games\f1
Game binaries and data.
.TP
\f4/usr/include\f1
Include header files (for C programs, etc).
.TP
\f4/usr/lib\f1
Program libraries, various architecture-dependent databases, and
executables not invoked directly by the user (system daemons, etc).
.TP
\f4/usr/share\f1
Subtree for architecture-independent sharable files.
.TP
\f4/usr/share/man\f1
Subdirectories for on-line reference manual pages (if present).
.TP
\f4/usr/share/lib\f1
Architecture-independent databases.
.TP
\f4/usr/src\f1
Source code for utilities and libraries.
.TP
\f4/usr/ucb\f1
Berkeley compatibility package binaries.
.TP
\f4/usr/ucbinclude\f1
Berkeley compatibility package header files.
.TP
\f4/usr/ucblib\f1
Berkeley compatibility package libraries.
.P
A machine with disks may export root file systems, swap files,
and 
\f4/usr\f1
file systems to diskless or partially-disked machines
that mount them into the standard file system hierarchy.
The standard directory tree for sharing these file systems from a
server is:
.TP 1.55i
\f4/export\f1
The default root of the exported file system tree.
.TP
\f4/export/exec/\f2architecture-name\f1
The exported 
\f4/usr\f1
file system supporting
.I architecture-name
for the current release.
.TP
\f4/export/exec/\f2architecture-name\f4.\f2release-name\f1
The exported
\f4/usr\f1
file system supporting 
.I architecture-name
for System V
.IR release-name .
.TP
\f4/export/exec/share\f1
The exported common
\f4/usr/share\f1
directory tree.
.TP
\f4/export/exec/share.\f2release-name\f1
The exported common \f4/usr/share\f1 directory tree for System V
.IR release-name .
.TP
\f4/export/root/\f2hostname\f1
The exported root file system for
.IR hostname .
.TP
\f4/export/swap/\f2hostname\f1
The exported swap file for
.IR hostname .
.TP
\f4/export/var/\f2hostname\f1
The exported
\f4/var\f1
directory tree for
.IR hostname .

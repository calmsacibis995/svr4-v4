.SH NAME
\*(dr \- CD-ROM Target Driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
\*(dr is a SCSI Driver Interface (SDI) compliant CD-ROM target driver that
provides access to one or more CD-ROM drives.  Each drive
must be attached to a SCSI Bus that is controlled by an
SDI-compliant host adapter driver
[for example, see \f4scsi_adaptec\fP(7)].
.PP
Access to the particular drive is accomplished via the \*(dr
device nodes located in \f4/dev/[r]cdrom\fP.
Each device node identifies a particular drive
based on the SCSI ID assigned to that drive.  The binding between
a device node and a CD-ROM drive is as follows:
.RS
.TP 20
\f4/dev/[r]cdrom/cd0\fP	CD-ROM drive with lowest SCSI ID
.TP
\f4/dev/[r]cdrom/cd1\fP	CD-ROM drive with next to lowest SCSI ID
.TP
and so on through \f4/dev/[r]cdrom/cd7\fP.
.RE
.PP
Most CD-ROM drives can handle CD-ROM disks that contain
two types of data: informational data and audio data.
The \*(dr driver allows access to both types of data. 
.PP
A CD-ROM disk that contains informational data is treated as a
random-access storage device, such as a hard disk.  The information
on the disk is divided into consecutively numbered, fixed-size (usually
2 Kbytes) sectors that may be accessed in any order.  The standard
tools for reading data from a random-access device, such as \f4dd(1)\fP
or \f4read(2)\fP, can be used to read data from a CD-ROM.  However, 
all write operations are prohibited.
.PP
When accessing audio data, the commands do not return data to the host
system (as is the case with informational data).  Rather, audio commands 
control the operation of the drive's
audio output hardware (usually a head-phone jack physically located on
the drive).  For example, the \f4C_PLAYAUDIO\fP command causes the audio
hardware to decode and convert to analog the audio data at a specific
location on the disk.
.PP
All audio data commands are invoked via the \f4ioctl\fP interface
and often require
a parameter structure that identifies the audio data
to be acted upon.  Unlike informational data, audio data is not referenced
by a sector address.  The methods used to identify a particular section
of audio data should be described in the SCSI Interface section of the 
reference manual supplied with your CD-ROM drive.
.PP
Audio data cannot be read as if it were informational data, and
informational data cannot be played via the drive's audio hardware.
.SH ioctl Calls
The \f4scsi_cdrom\fP driver uses several \f4ioctl\fP commands that are 
listed below.
Many of these \f4ioctl\fP commands provide
a convenient method for sending one of the preselected SCSI commands
directly to the drive.  SCSI commands not explicitly supported by
the \*(dr driver can be sent to the drive via the pass-through facility
provided by the SDI Host Adapter driver; for example
see \f4scsi_adaptec\fP(7) for details.
.PP
The following \f4ioctl\fPs are used to identify a target driver and get a
pass-through major and minor number for a target device. [for example, see
\f4scsi_adaptec\fP(7)].
.RS
.TP 18
\f4B_GETTYPE\fP
Returns the type of peripheral bus (for example, \f4scsi\fP)
used and the name of this driver (for example, \f4scsi_cdrom\fP).
.TP
\f4B_GETDEV\fP
Returns the major and minor number of the pass-through device for
the CD-ROM drive.  See, for example, \f4scsi_adaptec\fP(7) for details.
.RE
.PP
The following \f4ioctl\fPs cause the appropriate Group-0 SCSI command to
be sent to the device.  These commands are defined by the SCSI Bus
specification and should also be described in the SCSI Interface
section of the reference manual supplied with your CD-ROM drive.
.RS
.TP 18
\f4C_TESTUNIT\fP
Sends a Test Unit Ready command to the device.
.TP
\f4C_REZERO \fP
Sends a Rezero Device command to the device.
.TP
\f4C_SEEK\fP
Sends a Seek command to the device.
.TP
\f4C_INQUIR\fP
Sends an Inquiry command to the device and returns the
resulting data back to the caller.
.TP
\f4C_STARTUNIT\fP 
Sends a Start Unit command to the device.
.TP
\f4C_STOPUNIT \fP
Sends a Stop Unit command to the device.
.TP
\f4C_PREVMV \fP
Sends a Prevent Media Removal command to the device.
.TP
\f4C_ALLOMV\fP
Sends an Allow Media Removal command to the device.
.RE
.PP
The following \f4ioctl\fPs cause the appropriate Group-1 SCSI command to
be sent to the device.
The Group-1 SCSI commands are defined by the
SCSI Bus specification and should be described in the SCSI Interface
section of the reference manual supplied with your CD-ROM drive.
.RS
.TP 18
\f4C_READCAPA\fP
Sends a Read Capacity command to the device and returns the
data sent by the drive.
.RE
.PP
The following \f4ioctl\fPs cause the appropriate Group-6 SCSI command to
be sent to the drive.
Group-6 SCSI commands are vendor specific and
should be described in the SCSI Interface section of the reference
manual supplied with your drive.
Since the format of these SCSI commands is vendor specific,
these \f4ioctl\fPs are supported only by products compatible with the Toshiba 3200B.
.PP
.RS
.TP 18
\f4C_AUDIOSEARCH\fP
Sends an Audio Search command to the device.
.TP
\f4C_PLAYAUDIO\fP
Sends a Play Audio command to the device.
.TP
\f4C_STILL\fP
Sends a Still command to the device.
.TP
\f4C_TRAYOPEN\fP
Sends a Tray Open command to the device.
.TP
\f4C_TRAYCLOSE\fP
Sends a Tray Close command to the device.
.RE
.PP
The following \f4ioctl\fPs are also supported the \*(dr driver.
.RS
.TP 18
\f4B_GET_SUBDEVS\fP
Returns the number of sub-devices supported by this driver (e.g., 1).
.TP
\f4C_ERRMSGON\fP
Enables the \*(dr-related system error messages.
.TP
\f4C_ERRMSGOFF\fP
Disables the \*(dr-related system error messages.

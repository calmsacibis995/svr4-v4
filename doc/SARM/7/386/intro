.SH NAME
\f4intro\f1 \- introduction to special files
.SH DESCRIPTION
This section describes various special files that refer to specific
hardware peripherals, and
.SM UNIX
system device drivers.
\s-1STREAMS\s0 [see \f4intro\fP(2)] software drivers, modules and the
\s-1STREAMS\s0-generic set of \f4ioctl\fP(2) system calls are also
described.
.P
For hardware related files, the names of the entries are generally
derived from names for the hardware, as opposed to the names of the
special files themselves.
Characteristics of both the hardware device and the corresponding
.SM UNIX
system device driver are discussed where applicable.
.PP
Disk device file names are in the following format:
.sp
\f4/dev/{r}dsk/{1.0}s#\f1  For integral disks
.sp
\f4/dev/{r}dsk/c#t#d#s#\f1 For SCSI disks
.sp
where
\f4r\f1
indicates a raw interface to the disk, the
\f4c#\f1
indicates the SCSI host adapter number,
\f4t#\f1
indicates the SCSI target \f2ID\f1 of the device,
\f4d#\f1
indicates the device attached to the controller and
\f4s#\f1
indicates the section number of the partitioned device.

\f2Getting Started Guide\f1.

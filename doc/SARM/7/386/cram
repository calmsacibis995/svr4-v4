.SH NAME
\f4cram\f1\- CMOS RAM interface
.SH DESCRIPTION
The cram driver provides an interface to the 64 bytes of battery backed-up
RAM.  This memory contains information such as diagnostics and
configuration information.
.SS Ioctl Calls
.TP
CMOSREAD
This call is used to read the contents of one of the CMOS RAM locations.  The
argument to the ioctl is the address of a buffer of two unsigned characters,
the first of which is the address to be read.  The ioctl will fill in the
second byte with the data.  An address less than 0 or greater than 63 will
result in an error, with
.I errno
set to ENXIO.
.TP
CMOSWRITE
This call is used to write a value into one of the CMOS RAM locations.  The
argument to the ioctl is the address of a buffer of two unsigned characters,
the first of which is the address and the second of which is
the value to write at that address.  An address less than 0 or greater than
63 will result in an error, with
.I errno
set to ENXIO.  Note that only the super-user may open the CMOS RAM
device for writing, and that the CMOSWRITE ioctl will fail for any other than
the super-user.

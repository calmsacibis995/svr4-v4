.SH NAME
\f4lp\f1 \- parallel port interface
.SH DESCRIPTION
The parallel port (lp) driver supports both the primary (monochrome)
and secondary parallel printer adapters simultaneously.
Up to two printers are supported.
If an adapter for a printer is not installed, an attempt to
.I open
it will fail.
The
.I close
waits until all output is completed before returning to the user.
The lp
driver allows only one process at a time to write to the adapter.
If it is already busy, an
.I open
for writing will return an error.
However, the driver allows multiple
.IR open s
to occur if they are
.IR read-only .
.PP
The parallel printer adapters are character devices.
The minor device number
corresponds to the primary or secondary parallel printer adapter.
Thus,
minor device 0 corresponds to the primary parallel printer adapter, while
minor device 1 corresponds to the secondary adapter.
.PP
The parallel port behaves as described in
\f4termio\f1 (7).

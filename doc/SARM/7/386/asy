.SH NAME
\f4asy\f1 \- asynchronous serial port
.SH DESCRIPTION
The asy driver supports both the system board serial port and an additional
serial adapter simultaneously.  Up to two serial ports are supported.  If an
adapter for a port is not installed, an attempt to
open it will fail.  The port can be programmed for speed (50\(em19200 baud),
character length, and parity.  Output speed is always the same as input
speed.  The port behaves as described in
\f4termio\f1 (7).
.PP
The asynchronous port is a character-at-a-time device for both input and
output.  This characteristic both limits the bandwidth which can be achieved
over a line, and increases the interrupt loading on the central processor.
In particular, file transfer programs such as
\f4uucp\f1(1)
may not function well at speeds over 4800 baud.
.PP
The baud rates of the serial adapter programmable baud-rate generator do not
correspond exactly with system baud rates.  In particular, setting B0 will
cause a disconnect, setting EXTA will set 19200 baud, and setting EXTB will
set 38400 baud.  It is not possible to directly set 2000, 3600, or 7200 baud.
The asynchronous ports driver supports line signal (hardware)
flow control when the device node \f4/dev/tty0?h\f1 is used.
The \f4/dev/tty0?\f1 ports are software flow control nodes as
are the \f4/dev/tty0?\f1 nodes.
.P
Note:  when adding \f4asy\fP to the \f4mdevice\fP file [see \f4mdevice\fP(4)],
the number in the \f2Maximum Units\fP field must be 1.

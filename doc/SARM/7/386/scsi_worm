.SH NAME
scsi_worm \- \f4sw01\fP SCSI WORM Target Driver
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\*(dr is an SDI compliant WORM (Write Once Read Many) target driver that
provides access to one or more WORM drives.  
Each drive must be attached to a SCSI Bus that is controlled 
by a SCSI Device Interface (SDI) compliant Host Adapter driver; see,
for example, \f4scsi_adaptec\fP(7).
.PP
Access to the particular drive is accomplished via the \*(dr
device nodes located in \f4/dev/[r]worm\fP.
Each device node identifies a particular drive
based on the SCSI ID assigned to that drive.  The binding between
a device node and a WORM drive is as follows:
.RS
.TP 20
\f4/dev/[r]worm/wm0\fP
WORM drive with lowest SCSI ID
.TP
\f4/dev/[r]worm/wm1\fP
WORM drive with next to lowest SCSI ID
.TP
and so on through \f4/dev/[r]worm/wm7\fP.
.RE
.PP
A WORM drive uses removable media that is divided into consecutively
numbered, fixed-size sectors that may be accessed in any order,
similar to a hard disk.
Most of the standard tools for reading and writing to and from a
hard disk, such as such as \f4dd(1)\fP or \f4read(2)\fP, 
work with a WORM drive.
However, keep in mind that for WORM drives each sector
can be written to only once.
This characteristic causes problems if a WORM device is mounted
[\f4mount(1M)\fP] without using the Read-Only flag.
.SH ioctl Calls
\*(dr supports several \f4ioctl\fP functions [see \f4ioctl\fP(2) in
the \f2Programmer's Reference Manual\fP]  which are accessed via
the \f4ioctl\fP system call.
Many of the supported \f4ioctl\fPs provide
a convenient method for sending one of the preselected SCSI commands
directly to the drive.
SCSI commands not explicitly supported by
\*(dr can be sent to the drive via the pass-through facility
provided by the SDI Host Adapter driver.
Refer to \f4scsi(7)\fP for details.
.PP
The following \f4ioctl\fPs are defined and required by the SDI interface.
.RS
.TP 18
\f4B_GETTYPE\fP
Returns the type of peripheral bus (for example, \f4scsi\fP) used and
the name of this driver (for example, \f4sw01\fP).
.TP
\f4B_GETDEV\fP
Returns the major and minor number of the pass-through device for
the WORM drive.
See, for example, \f4scsi_adaptec\fP(7) for details.
.TP
\f4SDI_RESERVE\fP
Sends a SCSI \f4Reserve\fP command to the drive.
.TP
\f4SDI_RELEASE\fP
Sends a SCSI \f4Release\fP command to the drive.
.RE
.PP
The following \f4ioctl\fPs cause the appropriate Group-0 SCSI command to
be sent to the device.
These commands are defined by the SCSI Bus
specification and should also be described in the SCSI Interface
section of the reference manual supplied with your WORM drive.
.RS
.TP 18
\f4W_TESTUNIT\fP
Sends a Test Unit Ready\fP command to the device.
.TP
\f4W_REZERO\fP
Sends a Rezero Device\fP command to the device.
.TP
\f4W_SEEK\fP
Sends a Seek\fP command to the device.
.TP
\f4W_INQUIR\fP
Sends an Inquiry\fP command to the device and returns the
resulting data back to the caller.
.TP
\f4W_STARTUNIT\fP
Sends a Start Unit\fP command to the device.
.TP
\f4W_STOPUNIT\fP
Sends a Stop Unit\fP command to the device.
.TP
\f4W_PREVMV\fP
Sends a Prevent Media Removal\fP command to the device.
.TP
\f4W_ALLOMV\fP
Sends an Allow Media Removal\fP command to the device.
.RE
.PP
The following \f4ioctl\fPs cause the appropriate Group-1 SCSI command to
be sent to the device.  The Group-1 SCSI commands are defined by the
SCSI Bus specification and should be described in the SCSI Interface
section of the reference manual supplied with your WORM drive.
.RS
.TP 18
\f4W_READCAPA\fP
Sends a Read Capacity\fP command to the device and returns the
data sent by the drive.
.TP 18
\f4W_VERIFY\fP
Sends a Verify\fP command to the device.
.RE
.PP
The following \f4ioctl\fPs cause the appropriate Group-6 SCSI command to
be sent to the drive.
Group-6 SCSI commands are vendor specific and
should be described in the SCSI Interface section of the reference
manual supplied with your drive.
Since the format of these SCSI commands is vendor specific,
these \f4ioctl\fPs
are supported only by products compatible with the Toshiba D070 .
.RS
.TP 18
\f4W_STNCHECK\fP
Sends a Stand-By Check\fP command to the device.
.TP
\f4W_LOADCART\fP
Sends a Load Cartridge\fP command to the device.
.TP
\f4W_UNLOADCA\fP
Sends an Unload Cartridge\fP command to the device.
.TP
\f4W_READCB\fP
Sends a Read Control Block\fP command to the device.
.RE
.PP
The following \f4ioctl\fPs cause the appropriate Group-7 SCSI command to
be sent to the drive.
Group-7 SCSI commands are vendor specific and
should be described in the SCSI Interface section of the reference
manual supplied with your drive.
Since the format of these SCSI commands is vendor specific, these \f4ioctl\fPs
are supported only by products compatible with the Toshiba D070.
.RS
.TP 18
\f4W_CHECK\fP
Sends a Check\fP command to the device.
.TP
\f4W_CCHECK\fP
Sends a Contrary Check\fP command to the device.
.RE
.PP
The following \f4ioctl\fPs are also supported the \*(dr driver.
.RS
.TP 18
\f4B_GET_SUBDEVS\fP
Returns the number of sub-devices supported by this driver (for example, 1).
.TP
\f4W_ERRMSGON\fP
Enables the \*(dr related system error messages.
.TP
\f4W_ERRMSGOFF\fP
Disables the \*(dr related system error messages.

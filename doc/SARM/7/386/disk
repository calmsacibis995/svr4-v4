.SH NAME
\f4disk\f1 \- random access bulk storage medium
.SH DESCRIPTION
The secondary storage devices used by the system are fixed disks and
diskettes.
Disks are high-speed rotating magnetic media,
which are treated as a collection of concentric rings, known as
.IR tracks .
There are several platters (whose number is represented by \f2n\f1)
in the fixed disk providing up to two surfaces per platter
(or a total of up to 2\f2n\f1 surfaces);
each set of up to 2\f2n\f1 parallel tracks on these
surfaces is considered as a group, known as a
.IR cylinder .
Each track is divided into several
.IR sectors .
A sector is usually the smallest unit which can be transferred
to or from the disk.
However, the drivers allow
.I read
or
.I write
operations of any size to or from any location on the disk,
except for raw disks.
.SS Logical Disks
It is often useful to partition fixed physical disks
into smaller sections,
each of which can hold a separate file system.
The disk device driver can therefore divide a physical disk into smaller
.I logical disks
or
.IR partitions .
Each of these logical sub-disks behaves as if it were a distinct disk.
A typical division of a disk into logical sub-disks might be as follows:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\f4/dev/dsk/0s0\f1 represents the entire disk on drive 0
\f4/dev/dsk/0s\f11 represents the first partition on drive 0
\f4/dev/dsk/0s2\f1 represents the second partition on drive 0
\f4/dev/dsk/1s0\f1 represents the entire disk on drive 1
\f4/dev/dsk/1s1\f1 represents the first partition on drive 1
\f4/dev/dsk/1s2\f1 represents the second partition on drive 1

.PP
and similarly for the
.I raw
(character) logical disks, \f4/dev/rdsk/0s0\f1, \f4/dev/rdsk/0s1\f1, etc.
.PP
In fact, more complex arrangements are often created.
It is often desirable to have logical disks of different sizes,
which are suited to different uses.
Similarly, it is often desirable to have several alternative ways of
partitioning a single disk.
Refer to
\f4install\f1 (1M)
and
\f4mkpart\f1 (1M)
for the details of partitioning of a disk.
Instructions for partitioning are described in the
.IR "Operations/System Administration Guide" .

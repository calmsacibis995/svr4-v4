.SH NAME
wd \- Western Digital 8003 Adapter Board
.SH DESCRIPTION
The wd driver is a STREAMS
based driver conforming to the AT&T Data Link Provider (DLPI)
interface.
It provides DLPI Style 1
access to the Western Digital 8003 family of Local Area Network Adapters.
The board provides a pool of buffers for packets received from the
network and provides for all the management of the on-board buffers.
.P
The driver provides for IEEE 802.2 LLC Class 1
and Ethernet encapsulation of data.
All communication with the driver is done via STREAMS
messages in the Data Link Interface format specified in the file
/\f4usr\f1/\f4include\f1/\f4sys\f1/\f4dlpi.h\f1.
.P
The LLC1 protocol supports receipt of and response to
XID and TEST but currently does not generate them.
This may change with a later release of the driver.
Group SAPs are not currently supported although the broadcast
SAP is.
.P
A user may bind to any non-group SAP
address that is not already bound to another STREAM.
Attempts to bind to a non-legal SAP address are rejected.
.P
If the SAP value to be bound is larger than 255 (0xFF),
then the type of encapsulation is taken to be the older Ethernet style
rather than IEEE 802.2.
Rather than a SAP value, the value passed will be used as the
Ethernet type field for the STREAM.
.P
By supporting both link level types, the driver is capable of
supporting a wide variety of protocols.
.P
A number of ioctl operations are supported.
Some of the operations may be specific to the
Western Digital ViaNet\(rg product.
.P
.RS
.TP 1i
\f4DLGADDR\f1
Get the MAC address of the interface.
Takes a pointer to a 6-byte buffer.
.TP 1i
\f4DLSADDR\f1
Set a new MAC
address to be used by the interface.
Takes a pointer to a 6-byte buffer.
.TP 1i
\f4DLGBROAD\f1
Get the MAC broadcast address.
Takes a pointer to a 6-byte buffer.
.TP 1i
\f4DLGSTAT\f1
Get the current board statistics counters.
Takes a pointer to a \f4wdstat\f1 structure.
.TP 1i
\f4DLPROM\f1
Enable promiscuous mode.
Takes a pointer to an integer.
If the value is non-zero, promiscuous mode is enabled.
A zero value disables promiscuous mode.
.TP 1i
\f4DLSMULT\f1
Set a new multicast address and enable its reception.
A 6-byte buffer pointing to the multicast address must be passed
as the parameter.
.TP 1i
\f4DLGMULT\f1
Get the current multicast address table and its size.
The buffer provided by the user is filled with as many
multicast addresses as will fit.
The result of the ioctl will be the number of addresses in the whole table.
.TP 1i
\f4DLDMULT\f1
Delete a multicast address by passing a pointer to the 6-byte
multicast address that should be removed from the multicast table.

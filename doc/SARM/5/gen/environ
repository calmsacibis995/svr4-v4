.SH NAME
\f4environ\f1 \- user environment
.SH DESCRIPTION
When a process begins execution, 
exec
routines make available an array of strings called the
environment [see \f4exec\f1(2)].
By convention, these strings have the form \f2variable=value\f1,
for example, \f(CWPATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin\f1.
These environmental variables provide a way to make
information about a program's environment available to programs.
The following environmental variables can be used by
applications and are expected to be set in the target run-time environment.
.PP
.TP 12
\f4HOME\f1
The name of the user's login directory, set by
\f4login\fP(1)
from the password file
(see
\f4passwd\fP(4)).
.TP
\f4LANG\f1
The string used to specify localization information that
allows users to work with different national conventions.
The
\f4setlocale\fP(3C)
function looks for the
\f4LANG\f1
environment variable
when it is called with \f4""\fP as the
.I locale
argument.
\f4LANG\f1
is used as the default locale if the corresponding
environment variable for a particular category is unset.
.sp .5
For example, when
\f4setlocale\fP(\^)
is invoked as
.sp .25
	\f4setlocale(LC_CTYPE, "")\fP,
.sp .25
\f4setlocale\fP(\^)
will query the
\f4LC_CTYPE\f1
environment variable first to see if it is set and non-null.
If
\f4LC_CTYPE\f1
is not set or null,
then
\f4setlocale\fP(\^)
will check the
\f4LANG\f1
environment variable to see if it is set and non-null.
If both
\f4LANG\f1
and
\f4LC_CTYPE\f1
are unset or null,
the default
\f4C\f1
locale will be used to set the
\f4LC_CTYPE\f1
category.
.sp .5
Most commands will invoke
.sp .25
	\f4setlocale(LC_ALL, "")\fP
.sp .25
prior to any other processing.
This allows the command to be used with different national conventions
by setting the appropriate environment variables.
.sp .5
The following environment variables are supported
to correspond with each category of
\f4setlocale\fP(3C):
.RS
.TP 15
\f4LC_COLLATE\f1
This category specifies the collation sequence being used.
The information corresponding to this category is stored in a database 
created by the
\f4colltbl\fP(1M)
command.
This environment variable affects
\f4strcoll\fP(3C)
and
\f4strxfrm\fP(3C).
.TP
\f4LC_CTYPE\f1
This category specifies character classification, character conversion,
and widths of multibyte characters.
The information corresponding to this category is stored
in a database created by the
\f4chrtbl\fP(1M)
command.
The default
\f4C\f1
locale corresponds to the 7-bit
.SM ASCII
character set.
This environment variable is used by
\f4ctype\fP(3C),
\f4mbchar\fP(3C),
and many commands;
for example:
\f4cat\fP(1),
\f4ed\fP(1),
\f4ls\fP(1),
and
\f4vi\fP(1).
.TP
\f4LC_MESSAGES\f1
This category specifies the language of the message database being used.
For example, an application may have one message database
with French messages, and another database with German messages.
Message databases are created by the
\f4mkmsgs\fP(1M)
command.
This environment variable is used by
\f4exstr\fP(1),
\f4gettxt\fP(1),
\f4gettxt\fP(3C),
and
\f4srchtxt\fP(1).
.TP
\f4LC_MONETARY\f1
This category specifies the monetary symbols and delimiters used for a particular
locale.
The information corresponding to this category is stored in a database created
by the
\f4montbl\fP(1M)
command.
This environment variable is used by
\f4localeconv\fP(3C).
.TP
\f4LC_NUMERIC\f1
This category specifies the decimal and thousands delimiters.
The information corresponding to this category is stored in a database 
created by the
\f4chrtbl\fP(1M)
command.
The default
\f4C\f1
locale corresponds to \f4"."\fP as the decimal delimiter and no thousands delimiter.
This environment variable is used by
\f4localeconv\fP(3C), 
\f4printf\fP(3C),
and
\f4strtod\fP(3C).
.TP
\f4LC_TIME\f1
This category specifies date and time formats.
The information corresponding to this category is stored in a database
specified in
\f4strftime\fP(4).
The default
\f4C\f1
locale corresponds to U.S. date and time formats.
This environment variable is used by
many commands and functions;
for example:
\f4at\fP(1),
\f4calendar\fP(1),
\f4date\f1(1),
\f4strftime\fP(3C),
and
\f4getdate\f1(3C).
.RE
.TP
\f(CWMSGVERB\f1
Controls which standard format message components
\f4fmtmsg\f1 selects when messages are displayed to
\f4stderr\f1 [see \f4fmtmsg\fP(1) and \f4fmtmsg\f1(3C)].
.TP
\f(CWSEV_LEVEL\f1
Define severity levels and associate and print strings
with them in standard format error messages
[see \f4addseverity\fP(3C), \f4fmtmsg\fP(1), and \f4fmtmsg\f1(3C)].
.TP 12
\f4NETPATH\f1
A colon-separated list of network identifiers.
A network identifier is a character string used by the
Network Selection
component of the system to provide application-specific default
network search paths.
A network identifier must consist of non-\s-1NULL\s+1
characters and must have a length of at least 1.
No maximum length is specified.
Network identifiers are normally chosen
by the system administrator.
A network identifier is also the first field in
any
\f4/etc/netconfig\f1
file entry.
\f4NETPATH\f1
thus provides a link into the
\f4/etc/netconfig\f1
file and the information about a network contained in that network's entry.
\f4/etc/netconfig\f1
is maintained by the system administrator.
The library routines described in
\f4getnetpath\fP(3N)
access the
\f4NETPATH\f1
environment variable.
.TP
\f(CWNLSPATH\fP
Contains a sequence of templates which
\f(CWcatopen\fP(3C)
uses when attempting to locate message catalogs.
Each template consists of
an optional prefix,
one or more substitution fields,
a filename and an optional suffix.
.sp0.5
For example:
.sp0.5
.ft CW
.nf
	NLSPATH="/system/nlslib/%N.cat"
.fi
.ft 1
.sp0.5
.br
.ne4
defines that
\f(CWcatopen\fP(\|)
should look for all message catalogs in the
directory
\f(CW/system/nlslib\fP,
where the catalog name should be constructed from the
.I name
parameter passed to
\f(CWcatopen\fP(\|),
\f(CW%N\fP,
with the suffix \f(CW.cat\fP.
.IP
Substitution fields consist of a
\f(CW%\fP
symbol, followed by a single-letter keyword.
The following keywords are currently defined:
.sp .5
.TS
center, box;
lfCW l.
%N	T{
The value of the \f2name\fP parameter passed to
\f(CWcatopen\fP(\|).
T}
%L	The value of \f(CWLANG\fP.
%l	The language element from \f(CWLANG\fP.
%t	The territory element from \f(CWLANG\fP.
%c	The codeset element from \f(CWLANG\fP.
%%	A single \f(CW%\fP character.
.TE
.sp .5
An empty string is substituted if the specified value is not
currently defined.
The separators ``\f(CW_\fP'' and ``\f(CW.\fP'' are not included in
\f(CW%t\fP and \f(CW%c\fP
substitutions.
.IP
Templates defined in
\f(CWNLSPATH\fP
are separated by colons (\f(CW:\fP).
A leading colon or two adjacent colons (\f(CW::\fP) is equivalent to
specifying \f(CW%N\fP.
.sp0.5
For example:
.sp0.5
.ft CW
.nf
	NLSPATH=":%N.cat:/nlslib/%L/%N.cat"
.fi
.ft 1
.sp0.5
indicates to
\f(CWcatopen\fP(\|)
that it should look for the requested message catalog in
\f2name\fP,
\f2name\f(CW.cat\f1
and
\f(CW/nlslib/$LANG/\f2name\fP.cat\f1.
.TP
\f4PATH\f1
The sequence of directory prefixes that
\f4sh\fP(1),
\f4time\fP(1),
\f4nice\fP(1),
\f4nohup\fP(1),
and so forth,
apply in searching for a file known by an incomplete path name.
The prefixes are separated by colons
\f1(\f4\^:\^\f1).
\f4login\fP(1)
sets
\f4PATH\*S=/usr/bin\f1.
(For more detail, see \f4sh\fP(1).)
.TP
\f4SHELL\fP
When the shell is invoked, it scans the environment 
for this name.
If it is found and \f4rsh\fP is 
the filename part of its value, 
the shell becomes a restricted shell.
The value of this variable should be specified with an absolute pathname.
The variable is used by \f4make\f1(1), \f4ksh\f1(1),
\f4sh\f1(1), and \f4vi\f1(1), among other commands.
.TP
\f4TERM\f1
The kind of terminal for which output is to be prepared.
This information is used by commands, such as
\f4mm\fP(1)
or
\f4vi\fP(1),
which may exploit special capabilities of that terminal.
.TP
\f4TZ\f1
Time zone information.
The contents of the environment variable named \f(CWTZ\f1 are used by the
functions
\f(CWctime\f1(3C),
\f(CWlocaltime\f1(\|) (see \f4ctime\fP(3C)),
\f(CWstrftime\f1(3C)
and
\f(CWmktime\f1(3C)
to override the default timezone.
If the first character of \f(CWTZ\f1 is a colon (\f(CW:\f1), the behavior
is implementation defined, otherwise \f(CWTZ\f1 has the form:
.sp .5
.ft2
std\f4\|\fPoffset\fP\|[\|\fPdst\fP\|[\|\fPoffset\fP\|],\|[\|\fPstart\fP\|[\|/\fPtime\fP\|],\|\fPend\fP\|[\|/\fPtime\fP\|]\|]\|]
.ft1
.RS 12
.TP
\f2std\fP\ and\ \f2dst\fP
Three or more bytes that are the designation for the standard
(\f2std\f1)
and daylight savings time
(\f2dst\f1)
timezones.
Only
.I std
is required, if
.I dst
is missing, then daylight savings time does not apply in this locale.
Upper- and lower-case letters are allowed.
Any characters
except a leading colon (\f(CW:\fP), digits, a comma (\f(CW,\fP), a minus 
(\f(CW\-\fP)
or a plus (\f(CW+\fP) are allowed.
.TP
\f2offset\fP
Indicates the value one must add to the local time to arrive at
Coordinated Universal Time.
The offset has the form:
.sp .5
.ft2
hh\f4\|[\|:\|\fPmm\fP\|[\|:\|\fPss\fP\|]\|]
.ft
.sp .5
.IP
The minutes
.RI ( mm )
and seconds
.RI ( ss )
are optional.
The hour
.RI ( hh )
is required and may be a single digit.
The
.I offset
following
.I std
is required.
If no
.I offset
follows
.I dst ,
daylight savings time is assumed to be one hour ahead of standard time.
One or more digits may be used; the value is always
interpreted as a decimal number.
The hour must be between 0
and 24, and the minutes (and seconds) if present between 0 and 59.
Out of range values may cause unpredictable behavior.
If preceded
by a ``\-'', the timezone is east of the Prime Meridian;
otherwise it is west (which may be indicated by an optional
preceding ``\f2+\fP'' sign).
.TP
\f2start\fP/\f2time\fP,\|\f2end\fP/\f2time\fP
Indicates when to change to and back from daylight savings time, where
.I start/time
describes when the change from standard time to daylight savings time occurs, and
.I end/time
describes when the change back happens.
Each
.I time
field describes when, in current local time, the change is made.
.IP
The formats of
.I start
and
.I end
are one of the following:
.RS
.TP
\f4J\fP\f2n\fP
The Julian day
.I n
(1 \(<=
.I n
\(<= 365).
Leap days are not counted.
That is, in all years, February 28 is
day 59 and March 1 is day 60.
It is impossible to refer to the occasional
February 29.
.TP
\f2n\fP
The zero-based Julian day
(0 \(<=
.I n
\(<= 365).
Leap days are counted,
and it is possible to refer to
February 29.
.TP
\f4M\fP\f2m.n.d\fP
The
.IR d \uth\d
day,
(0 \(<=
.I d
\(<= 6) of week
.I n
of month
.I m
of the year
(1 \(<=
.I n
\(<= 5, 1 \(<=
.I m
\(<= 12), where week 5 means ``the last
.IR d -day
in month
.IR m ''
which may occur in either the fourth or the fifth week).
Week 1 is the first week in which the 
.IR d \uth\d
day occurs.
Day zero is Sunday.
.RE
.IP
Implementation specific defaults are used for 
.I start
and
.I end
if these optional fields are not given.
.IP
The
.I time
has the same format as
.I offset
except that no leading sign (``\f2\-\fP'' or ``\f2+\fP'') is allowed.
The default, if
.I time
is not given is 02:00:00.
.RE
.PP
Further names may be placed in the environment by
the
\f4export\^\f1
command and
.IR name = value
arguments in
\f4sh\fP(1),
or by
\f4exec\fP(2).
It is unwise to conflict with
certain shell variables that are frequently exported by
\f4\&.profile\f1
files:
\f4MAIL\f1\*S,
\f4PS1\f1\*S,
\f4PS2\f1\*S,
\f4IFS\f1\*S
(see
\f4profile\fP(4)).

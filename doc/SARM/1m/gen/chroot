.SH NAME
\f4chroot\f1 \- change root directory for a command
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/usr/sbin/chroot\f1
\f2newroot command\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4chroot\f1
causes the given command to be executed
relative to the new root.
The meaning of any initial slashes
(\f4/\^\f1)
in the path names is changed for the command and any of its child processes to
\f2newroot\f1 .
Furthermore, upon execution, the initial working directory is
\f2newroot\f1 .
.PP
Notice, however, that if you redirect the output of the command
to a file:
.PP
.RS
\f4chroot \|\f2newroot \|command\f1 \|>\f4x\f1
.RE
.PP
will create the file
\f4x\f1
relative to the original root of the command, not the new one.
.PP
The new root path name is always relative to the current root: even if a
\f4chroot\fP
is currently in effect, the
\f2newroot\f1
argument is relative to the current root of the
running process.
.PP
This command can be run only by the super-user.

\f2Programmer's Reference Manual\f1.

.SH NOTES
One should exercise extreme caution when referencing device files
in the new root file system.
.P
When using \f4chroot\f1, do not exec a
command that uses shared libraries. 
This will result in killing your process.

.SH NAME
\f4telnetd\f1 \- DARPA TELNET protocol server
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4in.telnetd\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4telnetd\f1
is a server which supports the
.SM DARPA
standard
.SM TELNET
virtual terminal protocol.
\f4telnetd\f1
is invoked by the internet server [see
\f4inetd\f1(1M)],
normally for requests to connect to the
.SM TELNET
port as indicated by the
\f4/etc/services\f1
file [see
\f4services\f1(4)].
.PP
\f4telnetd\f1
operates by allocating a pseudo-terminal device
for a client, then creating a login process which has
the slave side of the pseudo-terminal as its standard input, output,
and error.
The login process is an instance of the
\f4in.login\f1 program, which is based on \f4login\fP(1).
It is invoked with the \f4\-h\f1 option to indicate
that it is originated by \f4telnetd\fP.
\f4telnetd\f1
manipulates the master side of the pseudo-terminal,
implementing the
.SM TELNET
protocol and passing characters
between the remote client and the login process.
.PP
When a
\f4TELNET\f1
session is started up, 
\f4telnetd\f1
sends
.SM TELNET
options to the client side indicating
a willingness to do
.I remote echo
of characters, to
.I suppress go
.IR ahead ,
and to receive
.I terminal type information
from the remote client.
If the remote client is willing, the remote terminal type is
propagated in the environment of the created login process.
The pseudo-terminal allocated to the client is configured
to operate in \*(lqcooked\*(rq mode, and with
.SM
\f4XTABS\f1,
.SM
\f4ICRNL\f1,
and
\f4ONLCR\f1
enabled [see\p
.br
\f4termio\f1(4)].
.P
\f4telnetd\f1
is willing to do:
.IR echo ,
.IR binary ,
.I suppress go
.IR ahead ,
and
.I timing
.IR mark .\p
.br
\f4telnetd\f1
is willing to have the remote client do:
.IR binary ,
.I terminal
.IR type ,
and
.I suppress go
.IR ahead .

.SH NOTES
Some
.SM TELNET
commands are only partially implemented.
.PP
The
.SM TELNET
protocol allows for
the exchange of the number of lines and columns on the user's terminal,
but
\f4telnetd\f1
doesn't make use of them.
.PP
Binary mode
has no common interpretation except between similar operating\p
.br
systems
.PP
The terminal type name received from the remote client is converted to
lower case.
.PP
The
.I packet
interface to the pseudo-terminal
should be used for more
intelligent flushing of input and output queues.
.LP
\f4telnetd\f1
never sends
.SM TELNET
.I go ahead
commands.
.LP
\f4telnetd\f1
can only support 64 pseudo-terminals.

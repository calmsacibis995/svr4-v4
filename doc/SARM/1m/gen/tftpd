.SH NAME
\f4tftpd\f1 \- \s-1DARPA\s0 Trivial File Transfer Protocol server
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4in.tftpd\f1
[ \f4\-s\f1 ]
.RI [ " homedir " ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4tftpd\f1
is a server that supports the
.SM DARPA
Trivial File Transfer Protocol (\s-1TFTP\s0).
This server is normally started by
\f4inetd\f1(1M)
and operates at the port indicated in the
\f4tftp\f1
Internet service description in the
\f4/etc/inetd.conf\f1 file.
By default, the entry for \f4tftpd\f1 in \f4etc/inetd.conf\f1
is commented out.
To make \f4tftpd\f1 operational, the comment
character(s) must be deleted from the \f4tftpd\fP entry.
See
\f4inetd.conf\f1(4)
for details.
.PP 
Before responding to a request, the server attempts to change its
current directory to
.IR homedir ;
the default value is
\f4/tftpboot\f1.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\f4\-s\f1
Secure.
When specified, the directory change must succeed; and
the daemon also changes its root directory to
.IR homedir .
.IP
The use of
\f4tftp\f1  
does not require an account or password on the remote system.
Due to the lack of authentication information,
\f4tftp\f1  
will allow only publicly readable files to be accessed.
Files may be
written only if they already exist and are publicly writable.
Note
that this extends the concept of \(lqpublic\(rq to include all users on all
hosts that can be reached through the network; this may not be
appropriate on all systems, and its implications should be considered
before enabling this service.
.PP 
\f4tftpd\f1
runs with the user
.SM ID
and group
.SM ID
set to
[GU]ID_NOBODY.
\f4\-2\f1,
under the assumption that no files exist with that owner or group.
However, nothing checks this assumption or enforces this restriction.

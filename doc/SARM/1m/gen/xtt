.SH NAME
\f4xtt\f1 \- extract and print xt driver packet traces
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4xtt [\-f] [\-o]  \f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\f4xtt\fP
command
is a debugging tool for the \f4xt\fP(7) driver.
It performs an
\f4XTIOCTRACE\f1
\f4ioctl\fP(2)
call on its standard input file to turn on tracing and extract the
circular packet trace buffer
for the attached group of channels.
This call will fail if 
the standard input is not attached to an active
\f4xt\fP(7)
channel.
The packets are printed on the standard output.
.PP
The optional flags are:
.TP
\f4\-f\f1
Causes a
``formfeed''
character to be put out at the end of the output, 
for the benefit of page-display programs.
.TP
\f4\-o\f1
Turns off further driver tracing.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Returns \f40\f1 upon successful completion, \f41\f1 otherwise.
.SH NOTES
If driver tracing has not been turned on for the
terminal session by invoking \f4layers\fP(1)
with the \f4\-t\f1 option,
\f4xtt\fP will not generate any output the first
time it is executed.

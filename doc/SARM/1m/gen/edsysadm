.SH NAME
\f4edsysadm\f1 \- \f4sysadm\fP interface editing tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4edsysadm\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4edsysadm\f1
is an interactive tool that
adds or changes either menu and task definitions in
the \f4sysadm\f1 interface.
It can be used to make changes directly on-line on a specific machine or
to create changes that will become part of a software
package.
The command creates the administration files
necessary to achieve the requested changes
in the interface and either places them in the appropriate place for on-line
changes or saves them to be included in a software package.
.P
\f4edsysadm\f1
presents several screens, first prompting for which type of menu item you want
to change, \f4menu\f1 or \f4task\f1,
and then for what type of action to take, \f4add\f1 or \f4change\f1.
When you select \f4add\f1, a blank menu or task
definition (as described below) is provided for you to fill in.
When you select \f4change\f1, a series
of screens is presented to help identify the definition you wish to change.
The final screen presented is the menu or task definition filled in with its
current values, which you can then edit.
.P
The menu definition prompts and their descriptions are:

other menus that must be traversed (in the order they are traversed) to access
this menu.
Each menu name must be separated by colons.
For example, the menu location for a menu entry being added to the Applications
menu is \f(CWmain:applications\f1.

you do not need to give a full pathname.
If you name an item help file that does not exist,
you are placed in an
editor (as defined by $EDITOR) to create one.
The new file is created in the current directory and named \f(CWHelp\f1.

This is a scrollable field, showing a maximum of 50 alphanumeric characters
at a time.
.P
Once the menu or task has been defined, screens for
installing the menu or task or saving them for packaging are presented.
The package creation or
on-line installation is verified and you are informed upon completion.
.SH NOTES
For package creation or modification, this command automatically
creates a menu information file and a \f4prototype\fP
file in the current directory (the directory from which the
command is executed).
The menu information file is used during package installation
to modify menus in the menu structure.
A \f4prototype\fP file is an installation file which gives a listing of package
contents.
The \f4prototype\fP file created by \f4edsysadm\f1 lists the files defined
under task action and gives them the special installation class of "admin".
The contents of this \f4prototype\fP file must be incorporated in the package
\f4prototype\fP file.
.P
For on-line installation, \f4edsysadm\f1 automatically creates a menu
information file and adds or modifies the interface menu structure
directly.
.P
The item help file must follow the format shown in the
\f2Application Programmer's Guide\f1
in the ``Customizing the Administration Interace'' chapter or in
the \f2System Administrator's Guide\f1 in
the ``Customizing the \f4sysadm\f1 Interface'' appendix.

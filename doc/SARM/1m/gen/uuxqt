.SH NAME
\f4uuxqt\f1 \- execute remote command requests
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/usr/lib/uucp/uuxqt\f1 [\f2options\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4uuxqt\fP
is the program that executes remote job requests from remote systems
generated by the use of the
\f4uux\fP
command.
(\f4mail\f1 uses \f4uux\fP for remote mail requests).
\f4uuxqt\fP
searches the spool directories looking for execution requests.
For each request, \f4uuxqt\fP checks to see if all the required data files are
available, accessible, and the requested commands are permitted for the
requesting system.
The
\%\f4Permissions\f1
file is used to validate file accessibility and
command execution permission.
.PP
There are two environment variables that are set before the
\f4uuxqt\fP
command is executed:
.PP
UU_MACHINE is the machine that sent the job (the previous one).
.br
UU_USER is the user that sent the job.
.PP
These can be used in writing commands that remote systems can execute to
provide information, auditing, or restrictions.
\f4uuxqt\fP has the following options:
.TP .85i
\f4\-s\f2system\^\f1
Specifies the remote \f4system\fP name.
.TP
\f4\-x\f2debug_level\^\f1
\f2debug_level\f1 is a number from 0 to 9.
Higher numbers give more detailed
debugging information.

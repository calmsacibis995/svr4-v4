.SH DESCRIPTION
When a new mail message arrives,
the \f4mail\fP command first checks if the recipient's mailbox indicates
that the message is to be forwarded elsewhere (to some other recipient or
as the input to some command).
If the message is to be piped into a recipient-specified command,
\f4mail\fP invokes \f4mail_pipe\fP to do some validation and then execute
the command in the context of the recipient.
.PP
Command-line arguments are:

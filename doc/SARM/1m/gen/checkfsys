.SH NAME
\f4checkfsys\f1 \- check a file system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\f4checkfsys\f1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4checkfsys\f1 command allows you to check for and
optionally repair a damaged file system.
The command invokes a visual interface (the check task
available through the \f4sysadm\f1 command).
The initial prompt allows you to select the
device that contains the filesystem.
Then you are asked to
specify the type of checking.
The following choices are available:
.TP
\f4check only\f1
Check the file system.
No repairs are attempted.
.TP
\f4interactive fix\f1
Repair the file system interactively.
You are informed about each instance of damage and asked
if it should be repaired.
.TP
\f4automatic fix\f1
Repair the file system automatically.
The program applies a
standard repair to each instance of damage.
.TP
The identical function is available under the \f4sysadm\fP menu:
.sp
\f4sysadm check\f1
.SH NOTES
While automatic and interactive checks are generally successful, they
can occasionally lose a file or a file's name.
Files with content
but without names are put in the \f2file-system/\f1\f4lost+found\f1
directory.
.P
If it is important not to lose data, check the file system
first to see if it appears to be damaged.
If it does,
use one of the repair options of the task.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The \f4checkfsys\f1 command exits with one of the following values:
.TP
\f40\f1
Normal exit.
.TP
\f42\f1
Invalid command syntax.
A usage message is displayed.
.TP
\f47\f1
The visual interface for this
command is not available because it cannot invoke \f4fmli\fP.
(The FMLI package is not installed or is corrupted.)

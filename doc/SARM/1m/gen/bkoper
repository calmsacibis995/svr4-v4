.SH NAME
\f4bkoper\f1 \- interact with backup operations to service media insertion prompts
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4bkoper \f1[\f4\-u \f2users\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Backup operations may require an operator to
insert media
and to confirm proper volume labels.
The \f4bkoper\f1 command
provides a
\f4mailx\f1-like
interface for these operator interactions.
It begins by printing a list of headers.
Each header describes a backup operation requiring interaction,
the device requiring attention including the media type and label of the
volume to be inserted
(see \s-1EXAMPLE\s0).
The system displays prompts and the operator issues commands
to resolve the backup operation.
Typing a carriage return invokes the current header.
If no headers have been serviced, the current
header is the first header on the list.
If a header has been selected and serviced, the current header is
the next one following.
.P
\f4bkoper\fP
may be executed only by a user with superuser privilege.
By default, the operator may interact only with backup operations
that were started by the same user
.SM ID .
.P
If the
\f4-u\f2 users\f1
option is given,
the operator interacts only with backup operations started by the specified
.IR user (s).
.SS Commands
.TP 10
\f4!\f2shell-command\f1
Escapes to the shell.
The remainder of the line after the ! is sent
to the
.SM UNIX
system shell (\f4sh\f1)
to be interpreted as a command.
.TP 10
\f4=\f1
Prints the current backup operation number.
.TP 10
\f4?\f1
Prints this summary of commands.
.TP 10
[\f4p|t\f1] [\f2n\f1]
Both the \f4p\f1 and \f4t\f1 options operate in the same way.
Either option will interact with the backup operation described by the
\f2n\f1'th header.
\f2n\f1 defaults to the current header number.
.TP 10
\f4h\f1
Prints the list of backup operations.
.TP 10
\f4q\f1
Quits from \f4bkoper\f1.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS 
The exit codes for \f4bkoper\fP are the following:
.PP
\f40\f1 = successful completion of the task
.br
\f41\f1 = one or more parameters to \f4bkoper\f1 are invalid.
.br
\f42\f1 = an error has occurred which caused \f4bkoper\f1 to fail to
      complete \f2all\f1 portions of its task.
.SH EXAMPLE
A sample header is shown below.
Items appearing in the header are listed in the
following order:
header number, job-\s-1ID\s0, tag, originating device, destination
group, destination device, destination volume labels.
[See \f4bkreg\f1(1M) for descriptions of items.]
Not every header contains values for all these fields;
if a destination group is not specified in
\f4/etc/bkup/bkreg.tab\f1, then no value for
``destination group'' appears in the header.

.in 0
.P
Backup headers are numbered on the basis of
arrival; the oldest header has the lowest number.
If the destination device does not have a volume label,
a dash is displayed in the header.

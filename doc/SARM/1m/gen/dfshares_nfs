.SH NAME
\f4dfshares\f1 \- list available NFS resources from remote systems
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4dfshares\f1
[\f4\-F nfs\f1]
[\f4\-h\f1]
[\f2server\f1 .\ .\ .]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4dfshares\f1
provides information about resources available to the host through
Network File System.  The \f4\-F\f1 flag may be omitted if NFS is
the first file system type listed in the file \f4/etc/dfs/fstypes\f1.
.P
The query may be restricted to the output of resources available
from one or more servers.
.P
The \f2server\f1 option displays information about the 
resources shared by each server, where \f2server\f1 can be 
any system on the network.
If no server 
is specified, then \f2server\f1 is assumed to be the local system.
.P
\f4dfshares\f1 without arguments displays all resources shared on
the local system, regardless of file system type.
.P
The output of \f4dfshares\f1 consists of an optional header line
(suppressed with the \f4\-h\f1 flag) followed by a list of lines
containing whitespace-separated fields.  For each resource, the
fields are:
.PP
.RS
\f2resource server access transport\f1
.RE
where
.RS
.IP \f2resource\f1 13
Specifies the resource name that must be given to the \f4mount\f1(1M)
command.
.IP \f2server\f1 13
Specifies the system that is making the resource available.
.IP \f2access\f1 13
Specifies the access permissions granted to the client systems; 
however, \f4dfshares\f1 cannot determine this information 
for an NFS resource
and populates the field with a hyphen (\f4-\f1).
.IP \f2transport\f1 13
Specifies the transport provider over which the \f2resource\f1 
is shared; however,
\f4dfshares\f1 cannot determine this information for an NFS resource
and populates the field with a hyphen (\f4-\f1).

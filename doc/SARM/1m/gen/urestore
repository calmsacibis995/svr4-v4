.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4urestore\fP
posts requests for 
files or directories to be restored
from system-maintained archives.
If the appropriate archive containing the
requested files or directories is on-line,
the files or directories are restored immediately.
If not, a request to restore the specified files
or directories is posted to a restore status table,
\f4/etc/bkup/rsstatus.tab\fP.
A restore request that has been posted must later be
resolved by an operator (see
\f4rsoper\f1(1M)).
Each file or directory to be restored
is assigned a \f4restore\fP job \s-1ID\s+1
that can be used to monitor the progress of the restore
(see \f4ursstatus\f1(1M))
or to cancel it.
.P
The user must
have write permission for the current directory and
any subdirectories to be traversed in storing the restored files or directories.
Requests for restores may be made only by the
user who owned the files or directories
at the time the archive containing the files or directories was made,
or by a user with superuser privileges.
.SS Options
.TP 10
\f4-c \f2jobid\f1
Cancels a previously issued restore request.
.TP 10
\f4\-d \f2date\f1
Restores the filesystem or directory as of
.IR date .
(This may or may not be the latest archive.)
See
\f4getdate\fP(3C)
for valid date formats.
.TP 10
\f4\-m\f1
If the restore cannot be carried out immediately,
this option notifies the invoking user 
(via \f4mail\fP)
when the request has been completed.
.TP 10
\f4\-n\f1
Displays a list of all archived versions of the filesystem
or directory contained in the backup history log
but does not attempt to restore the filesystem or directory.
.TP 10
\f4\-o \f2target\f1
Instead of restoring 
directly to the specified file or directory,
this option replaces the file or directory
.I target
with the archive of the specified file or directory.
.TP 10
\f4\-s\f1
While a restore operation is occurring,
displays a ``.'' for each 100 (512-byte) blocks 
transferred from the destination device.
.TP 10
\f4\-v\f1
Displays the name of each object as it is restored.
Only those archiving methods that restore named directories
and files (\f4incfile, ffile\fP)
support this option.
.TP 10
\f4\-D\f1
Initiates a restore operation for directories.
.TP 10
\f4\-F\f1
Initiates a restore operation for files.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS 
The exit codes for \f4urestore\fP are the following:
.PP
\f40\fP = the task completed successfully
.br
\f41\fP = one or more parameters to \f4urestore\fP are invalid
.br
\f42\fP = an error has occurred, causing \f4urestore\fP to fail to
      complete \f2all\f1 portions of its task.
.SH EXAMPLES
.P
Example 1:
.P
.in 1.0i
\f4urestore \-m \-F bigfile\fP
.in 0
.P
posts a request to restore the most
current archived version of the file \f4bigfile\f1.
If the restore operation cannot
be carried out immediately, it notifies the invoking user
when the request has been completed.
.P
Example 2:
.P
.in 1.0i
\f4urestore \-c rest-256a,rest-256b\fP
.in 0
.P
cancels restore requests with job \s-1ID\s+1
numbers \f4rest-256a\f1 and \f4rest-256b\f1.
.P
Example 3:
.P
.in 1.0i
\f4urestore \-o /testfiles/myfile.b \-F /testfiles/myfile.a\fP
.in 0
.P
posts a request for the archived file
\f4/testfiles/myfile.a\fP to
be restored as
\f4/testfiles/myfile.b\fP
.P
Example 4:
.P
.in 1.0i
\f4urestore \-d "december 1, 1987" \-D /user1 -v\fP
.in 0
.P
posts a request for the archived directory structure
\f4/user1\f1, with all its files and subdirectories,
to be restored as of December 1, 1987.
If the restore is done immediately from an on-line archive,
the name of each file will be displayed on standard output
while the restore is underway.
.P
Example 5:
.P
.in 1.0i
\f4urestore \-n \-D /pr3/reports\fP
.in 0
.P
requests the system to display
the backup dates and an \f4ls -l\f1 listing
from the backup history log
of all archived versions of the directory 
\f4/pr3/reports\f1.
The directory is not restored.

.SH NAME
\f4delsysadm\f1 \- \f4sysadm\fP interface menu or task removal tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4delsysadm\f1\0\f2task\f1 | [\f4\-r\f1] \f2menu\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4delsysadm\f1 command
deletes a \f2task\fP or \f2menu\fP from the \f4sysadm\f1 interface and
modifies the interface directory structure on the target machine.
.TP 0.75i
.I task | menu
The logical name and location of the menu or task within the
interface menu hierarchy.
Begin with the top menu \f4main\f1 and
proceed to where the menu or the task resides, separating each
name with colons.
See EXAMPLES.
.IP
If the \f4-r\f1 option is used, this command will recursively remove all
sub-menus and tasks for this menu.
If the \f4-r\f1 option is not used, the menu must be empty.
.P
\f4delsysadm\f1 should only be used to remove items added as "on-line"
changes with the \f4edsysadm\f1 command.
Such an addition will have a package instance tag of ONLINE.
If the task or menu (and its sub-menus and tasks) have any
package instance tags other than ONLINE, you are asked whether to
continue with the removal or to exit.
Under these circumstances, you probably do not want to continue and you should
rely on the package involved to take the necessary actions to delete
this type of entry.
.P
The command exits successfully or provides the
error code within an error message.
.SH EXAMPLES
To remove the \f4nformat\f1 task, execute:
.P
.RS
\f4delsysadm main:applications:ndevices:nformat\fP.
.RE
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.nf
0   Successful execution
2   Invalid syntax
3   Menu or task does not exist
4   Menu not empty
5   Unable to update interface menu structure
.fi
.SH NOTES
Any menu that was originally a placeholder menu (one that only appears if
submenus exist under it) will be returned to placeholder status when a deletion
leaves it empty.
.P
When the \f4\-r\f1 option is used, \f4delsysadm\f1 checks for dependencies
before removing any subentries.
(A dependency exists if the menu being
removed contains an entry placed there by an application package).
If a dependency is found, the user is shown a list of packages that depend on
the menu being deleted and asked whether or not to continue.
If the answer is yes, the menu and all of its menus and tasks are removed
(even those shown to have dependencies).
If the answer is no, the menu is not deleted.
.P
\f4delsysadm\f1 should only be used to remove menu or task entries that have
been added to the interface with \f4edsysadm\f1.

.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4chargefee\fP
can be invoked to charge a
.I number\^
of units to \f2login-name\f1.
A record is written to \f4/var/adm/fee\f1,
to be merged with other accounting records by \f4runacct\f1.
.PP
\f4ckpacct\fP
should be initiated via \f4cron\fP(1M) to
periodically check the size of \f4/var/adm/pacct\f1.
If the size exceeds \f2blocks\fP, 1000 by default,
\f4turnacct\fP
will be invoked with argument \f2switch\f1.
If the number of free disk blocks in the
\f4/var\fP
file system
falls below 500,
\f4ckpacct\fP
will automatically turn off the collection of
process accounting records via
the
.I off
argument to \f4turnacct\fP.
When at least 500 blocks are restored, 
the accounting will be activated again
on the next invocation of \f4ckpacct\f1.
This feature is sensitive to the frequency at which
\f4ckpacct\fP
is executed, usually by \f4cron\fP.
.PP
\f4dodisk\fP
should be invoked by
\f4cron\fP
to perform the disk accounting functions.
By default, it will use \f4diskusg\f1 (see \f4diskusg(1M)\f1) to do
disk accounting on the \f4S5\f1 file system in \f4/etc/vfstab\f1
and \f4acctdusg [see \f4acct\f1(1M)] on non-s5 file systems.
If the
\f4\-o\f1
flag is used, it will use \f4acctdusg\f1 (see \f4acct(1M)\f1) to do a
slower version of disk accounting by login directory for all file
systems.
.I files
specifies the one or more filesystem names where disk accounting
will be done.
If
.I files
are used, disk accounting will be done on these
filesystems only.
If the
\f4\-o\f1
flag is used,
.I files
should be mount points of mounted filesystems.
If the \f4\-o\f1 option is omitted, \f2files\f1 should be the special file
names of mountable filesystems.
.PP
\f4lastlogin\fP
is invoked by
\f4runacct\fP
to update \f4/var/adm/acct/sum/loginlog\f1,
which shows the last date on which each person logged in.
.PP
\f4monacct\fP
should be invoked once each month or each accounting
period.
.I number\^
indicates
which month or period it is.
If
.I number
is not given, it defaults to the
current month (01\-12).
This default is useful if
\f4monacct\fP
is to executed via
\f4cron\fP(1M)
on the first day of each month.
\f4monacct\fP
creates summary files in
\f4/var/adm/acct/fiscal\f1
and restarts the summary files in \f4/var/adm/acct/sum\f1.
.PP
\f4nulladm\fP
creates
.I file\^
with mode 664 and ensures that owner and group are \f4adm\f1.
It is called by
various accounting shell procedures.
.PP
\f4prctmp\fP
can be used to print the session record file (normally
\f4/var/adm/acct/nite/ctmp\f1
created by
\f4acctcon1\f1 (see \f4acctcon(1M)\f1).
.PP
\f4prdaily\fP
is invoked by
\f4runacct\fP
to format a report of the previous day's accounting data.
The report resides in
\f4/var/adm/acct/sum/rprt/mmdd\f1
where
.I mmdd\^
is the month and day of the report.
The current daily accounting reports may be printed by typing \f4prdaily\fP.
Previous days' accounting reports can be printed by using the
.I mmdd
option and specifying the exact report date desired.
The
\f4\-l\f1
flag prints a
report of exceptional usage by login id for
the specified date.
Previous daily reports are cleaned up
and therefore inaccessible after each invocation of \f4monacct\fP.
The
\f4\-c\f1
flag prints a report
of exceptional resource usage by command,
and may be used on current day's accounting data only.
.PP
\f4prtacct\fP
can be used to format and print any total accounting (\f4tacct\fP) file.
.PP
\f4runacct\fP
performs the accumulation of connect,
process,
fee,
and disk accounting on a daily basis.
It also creates summaries of command usage.
For more information, see \f4runacct\fP(1M).
.PP
\f4shutacct\fP
is invoked during a system shutdown
to turn process accounting
off and append a "reason" record to \f4/var/adm/wtmp\f1.
.PP
\f4startup\fP
can be invoked when the system is brought to a multi-user state to
turn process accounting on.
.PP
\f4turnacct\fP
is an interface to
\f4accton\fP
(see
\f4acct\fP(1M))
to turn process accounting \f4on\fP or \f4off\fP.
The
\f4switch\fP\^
argument moves the current
\f4/var/adm/pacct\f1
to the next free name in
\f4/var/adm/pacct\f2incr\f1
(where
.I incr
is a number starting with \f41\f1
and incrementing by one 
for each additional \f4pacct\f1 file),
then turns accounting back on again.
This procedure is called by
\f4ckpacct\fP
and thus can be taken care of by
the \f4cron\fP and used to keep \f4pacct\fP
to a reasonable size.  \f4shutacct\f1 uses \f4turnacct\f1 to stop
process accounting.  \f4startup\f1 uses \f4turnacct\f1 to start
process accounting.

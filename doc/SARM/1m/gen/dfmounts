.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4dfmounts\f1
shows the local resources shared through a distributed
file system \f2fstype\f1 along with a list of clients that
have the resource mounted.
If \f2restriction\f1 is not specified,
\f4dfmounts\f1 displays remote resources mounted on 
the local system.
\f2Specific_options\f1 as well as the availability and
semantics of \f2restriction\f1 are specific to particular distributed
file system types.
.P
If \f4dfmounts\f1 is entered without arguments, all remote 
resources currently mounted on the local system are 
displayed, regardless of file system type.
.P
The output of \f4dfmounts\f1 consists of an optional header line
(suppressed with the \f4\-h\f1 flag) followed by a list of lines
containing whitespace-separated fields.  For each resource, the
fields are:
.LP
.RS 8
\f2resource server pathname clients\f1
.RE
where
.RS 5
.IP \f2resource\f1 15
Specifies the resource name that must be given to the \f4mount\f1(1M)
command.
.IP \f2server\f1 15
Specifies the system from which the resource was mounted.
.IP \f2pathname\f1 15
Specifies the pathname that must be given to the \f4share\f1(1M) command.
.IP \f2clients\f1 15
Lists the systems, comma-separated, by which the resource was mounted.
Clients are listed in the form \f2domain.\f1, \f2domain.system\f1, or 
\f2system\f1, depending on the file system type.
.RE
.P
A field may be null. Each null field is indicated by a
hyphen (\-) unless the remainder of the fields on the line
are also null.  In this case, it may be omitted.
.P
Fields with whitespace are enclosed in quotation marks (\f4" "\f1).
.SH "NOTES"
\f4dfmounts\fP may not indicate the correct state if you mount a
single resource on more than one directory.

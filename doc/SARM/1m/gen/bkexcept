.SH NAME
\f4bkexcept\f1 \- change or display an exception list
for incremental backups
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4bkexcept\f1 [\f4\-t \f2file\f1] [\f4\-d \f2patterns\f1]
.br
\f4bkexcept\f1 [\f4\-t \f2file\f1] \f4\-a|\-r \f2patterns\f1 
.br
\f4bkexcept \-C \f1[\f2files\f1] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4bkexcept\fP command
displays a list of patterns describing files that are to be excluded
when backup operations occur using
\f4incfile\f1.
The list is known as the ``exception list.''
.P
\f4bkexcept\fP
may be executed only by a user with superuser privilege.
.P
\f4bkexcept \-a\f1
adds patterns to the list.
.P
\f4bkexcept \-d\f1
displays patterns from the list.
.P
\f4bkexcept \-r\f1
removes patterns from the list.
.SS Patterns
Patterns describe individual pathnames or sets of pathnames.
Patterns must conform to 
pathname naming conventions specified 
under \f3\s-1DEFINITIONS\s+1\f1 
on the \f4intro\f1(2) page.
A pattern is taken as a filename and is interpreted
in the manner of \f4cpio\f1.
A pattern can include the shell special characters 
\f4\(**\f1, \f4?\f1,
and \f4[]\f1.
Asterisk (\f4\(**\f1) 
and question mark (\f4?\f1) will match 
period (\f4.\f1) and slash(\f4/\f1).
Because these are shell special characters, they must be
escaped on the command line.
.PP
There are three general methods of specifying entries to
the exception list:
.RS 3
.TP 3
\-
To specify all files under a particular directory, specify the
directory name (and any desired subdirectories) followed by
an asterisk:
.in +2m
.sp .5
\f4/\f2directory\f4/\f2subdirectories\f4/\(**\f1
.in -2m
.sp .5
.TP
\-
To specify all instances of a filename
regardless of its location,
specify the filename preceded by an asterisk:
.sp .5
.in +2m
\f4\(**/\f2filename\f1
.in -2m
.sp .5
.TP
\-
To specify one instance of a particular file, specify the entire
pathname to the file:
.sp .5
.in +2m
\f4/\f2directory\f4/\f2subdirectories\f4/\f2filename\f1
.in -2m
.sp .5
.RE
.PP
If
.I pattern
is a dash (\f4\-\f1),
standard input is read for a list of patterns (one per line
until \s-1EOF\s+1) to be added or deleted.
.SS Compatibility
Prior versions of the backup service created exception lists
using \f4ed\f1 syntax.
\f4bkexcept \-C\f1
provides a translation facility for exception lists
created by \f4ed\f1.
The translation is not perfect; not all
\f4ed\f1
patterns have equivalents in
\f4cpio\f1.
For those patterns that
have no automatic translation,
an attempt at translation is made, and the translated version is
flagged with the word \f4QUESTIONABLE.\f1
The exception list translation is directed to standard output.
Redirect the standard output to a translation file,
review the contents of the translation file (correcting entries
that were not translated properly and deleting the
\f4QUESTIONABLE\f1 flags),
and then use the resulting file as input to a subsequent
\f4bkexcept \-a\f1.
For example, if the translated file was named \f4checkfile\f1
the \f4\-a\f1 option would appear as follows:
.RS
\f4bkexcept \-a \- < checkfile\f1
.RE
.SS Options
.TP
\f4\-t \f2file\f1
The filename used in place of the default file.
.TP
\f4-a \f2pattern...\f1 
Adds \f2pattern\f1 to the exception list where
\f2pattern\f1 is one or more patterns
(comma-separated or blank-separated
and enclosed in quotes)
describing sets of paths.
.TP
\f4\-d \f2pattern...\f1
Displays entries in the exception list.
If \f2pattern\f1 begins with a slash (/), \f4\-d\f1
displays all entries whose names begin with
\f2pattern\f1.
If \f2pattern\f1 does not begin with a slash, \f4\-d\f1
displays all entries that include
\f2pattern\f1 anywhere in the entry.
If \f2pattern\f1 is a dash (\f4\-\f1), input is taken from
standard input.  \f2pattern\f1 is not a pattern -- it matches
patterns.
\f2pattern\f1 \f4a\(**b\f1 matches \f4/a\(**b\f1 but does not match
\f4/adb\f1.
For files containing a carriage return, a null exception list
is returned.
For files of zero length (no characters), an error is returned (search
of table failed).
.IP "" 7
The entries are displayed in \s-1ASCII\s+1 collating sequence order
(special characters, numbers, then alphabetical order).
.TP
\f4\-r \f2pattern...\f1
Removes \f2pattern\f1 from the exception list.
\f2pattern\f1 is one or a list of patterns
(comma-separated or blank-separated
and enclosed in quotes)
describing sets of paths.
\f2pattern\f1 must be an exact match of an entry in
the exception list for \f2pattern\f1 to be removed.
Patterns that are removed are echoed to standard output, \f4stdout\f1.
.TP
\f4\-C \f1[\f2file\f1s]
Displays on standard output the translation of each
\f2file\f1 (a prior version's exception list) to the new syntax.
Each \f2file\f1 contains \f4ed\f1 patterns, one per line.
.IP "" 7
If \f2file\f1 is omitted, the default \s-1UNIX\s+1 exception
list, \f4/etc/save.d/except\f1, is translated.
If \f2file\f1 is a dash (\-), input is taken from
standard input, one per line.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS 
The exit codes for the \f4bkexcept\fP command are the following:
.PP
\f40\f1 = the task completed successfully
.br
\f41\f1 = one or more parameters to \f4bkexcept\fP are invalid
.br
\f42\f1 = an error has occurred, causing \f4bkexcept\fP to fail to
      complete \f2all\f1 portions of its task
.SH EXAMPLES
Example 1:
.RS 10
\f4bkexcept \-a /tmp/\(**,/var/tmp/\(**,/usr/rje/\(**,\(**/trash,\fP
.RE
.sp .5
adds the four sets of files to the exception list,
(all files under \f4/tmp\f1,
all files under \f4/var/tmp\f1,
all files under \f4/usr/rje\f1,
and any file on the system named \f4trash\f1).
.P
Example 2:
.RS 10
\f4bkexcept \-d /tmp\f1
.RE
.sp .5
displays the following patterns from those added to the
exception list in Example 1.
.RS 10
\f4/tmp/\(**\f1
.sp .25
\f4bkexcept \-d tmp\f1
.RE
.sp .5
displays the following patterns from those added to the
exception list in Example 1.
.RS 10
\f4/tmp/\(**, /var/tmp/\(**\f1
.RE
.sp .5
displays one per line, with a heading.
.P
Example 3:
.RS 10
\f4bkexcept \-r /var/tmp/\(**,/usr/rje/\(**\f1
.RE
.sp .5
removes the two patterns from the exception list.
.P
Example 4:
.RS 10
\f4bkexcept \-C /save.d/old.except > trans.except\f1
.RE
.sp .5
translates the file
\f4/save.d/old.except\f1
from its \f4ed\f1 format to \f4cpio\f1 format and sends the translations
to the file \f4trans.except\f1. 
The translations of \f4/save.d/old.except\f1
may be added to the current exception
list by using \f4bkexcept \-a\f1 as follows:
.sp .5
.RS 10
\f4bkexcept \-a \- < trans.except\f1
.RE
.SH FILES
.TP 1.75i

for \s-1UNIX System V Release 4.0\s+1.
.TP

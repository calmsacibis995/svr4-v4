.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX  "nfsstat command"  ""  "\fLnfsstat\fP \(em display network statistics"
.IX  "NFS statistics, display \(em \fLnfsstat\fP"

\f4nfsstat\f1
displays statistical information about the
NFS (Network File System) and
RPC (Remote Procedure Call), interfaces to the kernel.
It can also be used to reinitialize this information.
If no options are given the default is
.IP
\f4nfsstat \-csnr\f1
.LP
That is, display everything, but reinitialize nothing.
.SS Options
The options for \f4nfsstat\fP are as follows:
.TP
\f4\-c\f1
Display client information.
Only the client side NFS and RPC
information will be printed.
Can be combined with the
\f4\-n\f1 and \f4\-r\f1
options to print client
NFS or client RPC information only.
.TP
\f4\-s\f1
Display server information.
.TP
\f4\-n\f1
Display NFS information.
NFS information for both the client and server side will be printed.
Can be combined with the
\f4\-c\f1 and \f4\-s\f1
options to print client or server
NFS information only.
.TP
\f4\-r\f1
Display RPC information.
.TP
\f4\-z\f1
Zero (reinitialize) statistics.
This option is for use by the super-user only, and
can be combined with any of the above options to
zero particular sets of statistics after printing them.

.TP
\f4badcalls\f1
total number of calls rejected
.TP
\f4nullrecv\f1
number of times no RPC
packet was available when trying to receive
.TP
\f4badlen\f1
number of packets that were too short
.TP
\f4xdrcall\f1
number of packets that had a malformed header
.RE
.LP
The server NFS
display shows the number of NFS calls received 
(\f4calls\f1) and rejected (\f4badcalls\f1),
and the counts and percentages for the various calls that were
made.
.LP
The client RPC
display includes the following fields:
.RS
.TP 10
\f4calls\f1
total number of RPC calls sent
.TP
\f4badcalls\f1
total of calls rejected by a server
.TP
\f4retrans\f1
number of times a call had to be retransmitted
.TP
\f4badxid\f1
number of times a reply did not match the call
.TP
\f4timeout\f1

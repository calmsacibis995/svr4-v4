.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\f4edquota\f1
is a quota editor. 
One or more users may be specified on the command line.
For each user a temporary file is created with an
.SM ASCII
representation of the current disk quotas for that user
for each mounted ufs file system that has a \f4quotas\fP file,
and an editor is then invoked on the file.
A null entry is used if no \f4quotas\fP file exists for a file system.
The quotas may then be modified, new quotas added, etc.
Upon leaving the editor,
\f4edquota\f1
reads the temporary file and modifies the binary quota files to reflect
the changes made.
.LP
The editor invoked is
\f4vi\f1(1)
unless the
\f4EDITOR\fP
environment variable specifies otherwise.
.LP
Only the super-user may edit quotas. 
In order for quotas to be
established on a file system, the root
directory of the file system must
contain a file, owned by root, called
\f4quotas\f1.
See
\f4quotaon\f1(1M)
for details.
.P
\f2proto_user\fP and \f4username\fP can be numeric,
corresponding to the uid of a user.
Unassigned uids may be specified; unassigned names may not.
In this way, default quotas can be established for users
who are later assigned a uid.
.P
The options are:
.TP
\f4\-p\f1
Duplicate the quotas of the \f2proto_user\fP
specified for each \f2username\fP specified.
This is the normal mechanism used to initialize quotas
for groups of users.
.TP
\f4\-t\f1
Edit the soft time limits for each file system.
If the time limits are zero, the default time limits in
\f4/usr/include/sys/fs/ufs_quota.h\f1
are used.
Time units of sec(onds), min(utes), hour(s), day(s), week(s), and month(s)
are understood.
Time limits are printed in the greatest possible time unit such that
the value is greater than or equal to one.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4lpsystem\f1
command is used to define parameters for the
\s-1LP\s+1 
print service, with respect to 
communication (via a high-speed
network such as 
\s-1STARLAN\s+1 or \s-1TCP/IP\s+1)
with remote systems.
Only a privileged user
(that is, the owner of the login \f4root\fP)
may execute the \f4lpsystem\f1 command.
.PP
Specifically, the \f4lpsystem\f1 command
is used to define remote systems 
with which the local \s-1LP\s+1 
print service can exchange print requests.
These remote systems are described
to the local \s-1LP\s+1 print service 
in terms of several parameters 
that control communication: type, retry and timeout.
These parameters are defined in 
\f4/etc/lp/Systems\f1.
You can edit this file 
with a text editor
(such as \f4vi\f1)
but editing is not recommended.
.PP
The \f2type\f1 parameter defines
the remote system as one of two types:
\f4s5\f1 (System V Release 4)
or \f4bsd\f1 (Sun\s-1OS\s+1).
The default type is \f4s5\f1.
.PP
The \f2timeout\f1 parameter
specifies the length of time (in minutes)
that the print service should allow 
a network connection to be idle.
If the connection to the remote system 
is idle (that is, there is no network traffic) 
for \f2N\f1 minutes,
then drop the connection.
(When there is more work 
the connection will be restablished.)
Legal values are \f4n\f1, \f40\f1, and \f2N\f1,
where \f2N\f1 is an integer greater than 0.
The value \f4n\f1
means ``never time out'';
\f40\f1 
means ``as soon as the connection is idle, drop it.''
The default is \f4n\f1.
.PP
The \f2retry\f1 parameter specifies 
the length of time to wait before trying to
re-establish a connection to the remote system,
when the connection was dropped abnormally
(that is, a network error).
Legal values are \f4n\f1, \f40\f1, and \f2N\f1,
where \f2N\f1 is an integer greater than 0
and it means ``wait \f2N\fP minutes 
before trying to reconnect.
(The default is 10 minutes.)
The value \f4n\f1 means 
``do not retry dropped connections 
until there is more work'';
\f40\f1 means 
``try to reconnect immediately.''
.PP
The \f2comment\fP argument
allows you to associate a free form comment
with the system entry.
This is visible when
\f4lpsystem \-l\fP is used.
.PP
\f2System-name\f1 is 
the name of the remote system from which
you want to be able to receive jobs,
and to which you want to be able to send jobs.
.PP
The command \f4lpsystem \-l \f1[\f2system-name\f1]
will print out a description of
the parameters associated with \f2system-name\f1
(if a system has been specified), 
or with all the systems in its database
(if \f2system-name\f1 has not been specified).
.PP
The command
\f4lpsystem \-r \f2system-name\f1
will remove the entry associated
with \f2system-name\f1.
The print service will no longer accept
jobs from that system 
or send jobs to it, 
even if the remote printer 
is still defined on the local system.
.PP
The command \f4lpsystem \-A\f1
will print out the 
.SM "TCP/IP" 
address of the local machine 
in a format to be used when configuring the local
port monitor to accept requests from a 
Sun\s-1OS\s+1 system.
.SH NOTES:
With respect to \f4/etc/lp/Systems\f1,
this information is relatively minimal with repect
to controlling network communications.
Network addresses and services 
are handled by the \f4Netconfig\fP and \f4Netdir\fP
facilities (see the ``Network Services'' chapter
in the \f2System Administrator's Guide\f1 
for a discussion of network addresses and services.)
Port monitors handle listening 
for remote service requests and routing 
the connection to the print service 
(see the ``Service Access'' chapter in the 
\f2System Administrator's Guide\f1
for a discusion of port monitors.)
.PP
If the \f4Netconfig\f1 and \f4Netdir\f1 facilities 
are not set up  properly, 
out-bound remote print service probably will not work.
Similarly,
if the local port monitors are not set up 
to route remote print requests to the print service,
then service for remote systems will not be provided.
(See 
``Allowing Remote Systems to Access Local Printers"
and "Configuring a Local Port Monitor"
in the ``Print Service" chapter of the 
\f2System Administrator's Guide\f1
to find out how to do this.)
.PP
With respect to the semantics of
the \f2timeout\fP and \f2retry\fP values, 
the print service uses one process 
for each remote system with which it communicates, 
and it communicates with a remote system
only when there is work to be done on that system
or work being sent from that system.
.PP
The system initiating the connection is
the ``master'' process and 
the system accepting the connection
is the ``slave'' process.
This designation serves only to determine 
which process dies (the slave) 
when a connection is dropped.
This helps prevent there from being more than one
process communicating with a remote system.
Furthermore, all connections are bi-directional,
regardless of the master/slave designation.
You cannot control a system's master/slave designation.
Now, keeping all this information in mind,
if a master process times out,
then both the slave and master will exit.
If a slave times out, then it is possible that
the master may still live and retry the connection 
after the retry interval.
Therefore, one system's resource management
strategy can effect another system's strategy.
.PP
With respect to \f4lpsystem \-A\f1:
a Sun\s-1OS\s+1 system 
(described with \f4\-t bsd\fP)
can be connected to your system
only via \s-1TCP/IP\s+1,
and print requests from a Sun\s-1OS\s+1 system 
can come in to your machine only
via a special port (515).
The address given to you from \f4lpsystem\f1 
will be the address of your system and port 515.
This address is used by your \s-1TCP/IP\s+1
port monitor (see \f4sacadm\f1(1M)
and \f4nlsadmin\f1(1M)) to ``listen'' on 
that address and port, and to route connections 
to the print service.
(This procedure is discussed in 
the ``Service Access'' chapter of the
\f2System Administrator's Guide\fP.)
The important point here is that 
this is where you get the address refered
to in that procedure.
.PP
The command \f4lpsystem \-A\f1 will not work 
if your system name and 
\s-1IP\s+1 address are not listed 
in \f4/etc/inet/hosts\f1
and the printer service is not listed in 
\f4/etc/inet/services\f1.

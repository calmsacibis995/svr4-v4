.SH NAME
\f4sync\f1 \- update the super block
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4sync\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4sync\fP
executes the
\f4sync\fP
system primitive.
If the system is to be stopped,
\f4sync\fP
must be called to insure
file system integrity.
It will flush all previously unwritten system buffers out to disk,
thus assuring that all file modifications up to that point will be
saved.
See
\f4sync\fP(2)
for details.
.SH NOTE
If you have done a write to a file on a remote machine
in a Remote File Sharing environment, you cannot use \f4sync\fP to
force buffers to be written out to disk on the remote machine.
\f4sync\fP will only write local buffers to local disks.

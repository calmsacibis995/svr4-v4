.SH NAME
\f4rfpasswd\f1 \- change Remote File Sharing host password
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4rfpasswd\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4rfpasswd\fP updates the Remote File Sharing authentication 
password for a host;
processing of the new password follows the same criteria as
\f4passwd\fP(1).
The updated password is registered at the domain name server 
(/etc/dfs/rfs/auth.info/\f2domain\f1/passwd) and replaces
the password stored at the local host (\f4/etc/dfs/rfs/loc.passwd\f1 file).
.P
This command is restricted to the super-user.
.P
NOTE: If you change your host password, make sure that hosts that
validate your password are notified of this change.  To receive
the new password, hosts must obtain a copy of the \f2domain/\f4passwd\f1
file from the domain's primary name server.  If this is not done,
attempts to mount remote resources may fail!
.SH ERRORS
If (1) the old password entered from this command does not match
the existing password for this machine, (2) the two new passwords
entered from this command do not match, (3) the new password does not
satisfy the security criteria in
\f4passwd\fP(1),
(4) the domain name server does not know about this machine, or (5)
the command is not run with super-user privileges, an error message will
be sent to standard error.  Also, Remote File Sharing must be running
on your host and your domain's primary name server.
A new password cannot be logged if a secondary
is acting as the domain name server.

.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4nlsadmin\f1 is the administrative command
for the network listener process(es) on a
machine.
Each network has at least one instance of the network listener process
associated with it; each instance (and thus, each network) is configured
separately.
The listener process ``listens'' to the network for service requests,
accepts requests when they arrive, and invokes servers in response to
those service requests.
The network listener process may be used with any network (more precisely,
with any connection-oriented transport provider) that conforms to the
transport provider specification.
.PP
\f4nlsadmin\f1 can establish a listener process for a given network,
configure the specific attributes of that listener, and start and kill
the listener process for that network.
\f4nlsadmin\f1 can also report on the listener processes on a
machine, either individually (per network) or collectively.
.PP
The list below shows how to use \f4nlsadmin\f1.
In this list, \f2net_spec\f1 represents a particular listener
process.
Specifically, \f2net_spec\f1 is the relative path name of the entry
under \f4/dev\f1 for a given network (that is, a transport provider).
\f2address\f1 is a transport address on which to listen and is
interpreted using a syntax that allows for a variety of address formats.
By default, \f2address\f1 is interpreted as the symbolic ASCII
representation of the transport address.
An \f2address\f1 preceded by a \f4\ex\f1 will let you enter an address
in hexadecimal notation.
Note that \f2address\f1 must appear as a single word to the shell
and thus must be quoted if it contains any blanks.
.PP
Changes to the list of services provided by the listener or the
addresses of those services are put into effect immediately.
.PP
\f4nlsadmin\fP may be used with
the following combinations of options and arguments:
.TP .85i
\f4nlsadmin\f1
gives a brief usage message.
.TP
\f4nlsadmin\f1 \f4\-x\f1
reports the status of all of the listener processes installed on this
machine.
.TP
\f4nlsadmin\f1 \f2net_spec\f1
prints the status of the listener process for \f2net_spec\f1.
.TP
\f4nlsadmin\f1 \f4\-q\f1 \f2net_spec\f1
queries the status of the listener process for the specified
network, and reflects the result of that query in its exit code.
If a listener process is active, \f4nlsadmin\fP will exit with a status
of 0; if no process is active, the exit code will be 1;
the exit code will be greater than 1 in case of error.
.TP
\f4nlsadmin\f1 \f4\-v\f1 \f2net_spec\f1
prints a verbose report on the servers associated with
\f2net_spec\f1, giving the service code, status, command, and comment
for each.
It also specifies the \f4uid\f1 the server will run as and the list of
modules to be pushed, if any, before the server is started.
.TP
\f4nlsadmin\f1 \f4\-z\f1 \f2service_code \f2net_spec\f1
prints a report on the server associated with \f2net_spec\f1 that
has service code \f2service_code\f1, giving the same information as in the
\f4\-v\f1 option.
.TP
\f4nlsadmin\f1 \f4\-q\f1 \f4\-z\f1 \f2service_code \f2net_spec\f1
queries the status of the service with service code \f2service_code\f1 on
network \f2net_spec\f1, and exits with a status of 0 if that
service is enabled, 1 if that service is disabled, and greater
than 1 in case of error.
.TP
\f4nlsadmin \-l \f2address net_spec\f1
changes or set the transport address on which the listener listens
(the general listener service).
This address can be used by remote processes to access the servers
available through this listener (see the \f4\-a\f1 option, below).
.IP
If \f2address\f1 is just a dash ("\f4\-\f1"), \f4nlsadmin\fP will report
the address currently configured, instead of changing it.
.IP
A change of address takes effect immediately.
.TP
\f4nlsadmin \-t \f2address net_spec\f1
changes or sets the address on which the listener listens for
requests for terminal service but is otherwise similar to the \f4\-l\f1
option above.
A terminal service address should not be defined unless the appropriate
remote login software is available; if such software is available, it
must be configured as service code 1 (see the \f4\-a\f1 option,
below).
.TP
\f4nlsadmin \-i \f2net_spec\f1
initializes an instance of the listener for the network specified by
\f2net_spec\f1; that is, creates and initializes the files
required by the listener as well as starting that instance of the listener.
Note that a particular instance of the listener should be
initialized only once.
The listener must be initialized before assigning addresses or services.
.TP
\f4nlsadmin\f1 \f4\-a \f2service_code\f1 [\f4\-p \f2modules\f1] [\f4\-w\f2 name\f1] \f4\-c\f2 cmd \f4\-y\f2 comment net_spec\f1
.br
adds a new service to the list of services available through the
indicated listener.
\f2service_code\f1 is the code for the service, \f2cmd\f1 is
the command to be invoked in response to that service code, comprised of
the full path name of the server and its arguments, and \f2comment\f1 is
a brief (free-form) description of the service for use in various
reports.
Note that \f2cmd\f1 must appear as a single word to the shell;
if arguments are required the \f2cmd\f1 and its arguments must be
enclosed in quotation marks.
The \f2comment\f1 must also\p
.bp
appear as a single word to the
shell.
When a service is added, it is initially enabled (see the \f4\-e\f1 and
\f4\-d\f1 options, below).
.IP
Service codes are alphanumeric strings, and are administered by AT&T.
The numeric service codes 0 through 100 are reserved for internal use
by the listener.
Service code 0 is assigned to the nlps server,
which is the service invoked on the general listening address.
In particular, code 1 is assigned to the remote login service,
which is the service automatically invoked for connections to the
terminal login address.
.IP
If the \f4\-p\f1 option is specified, then \f2modules\f1 will be
interpreted as a list of \s-1STREAMS\s0 modules for the listener to push
before starting the service being added.
The modules are pushed in the order they are specified.
\f2modules\f1 should be a comma-separated list of modules, with no white
space included.
.IP
If the \f4\-w\f1 option is specified, then \f2name\f1 is interpreted as
the user name from \f4/etc/passwd\f1 that the listener should look up.
From the user name, the listener obtains the user ID, the group ID(s),
and the home directory for use by the server.
If \f4\-w\f1 is not specified, the default is to use the user name
\f4listen\f1.
.IP
A service must explicitly be added to the listener for each network on
which that service is to be available.
This operation will normally be performed only when the service is
installed on a machine, or when populating the list of services for a
new network.
.TP
\f4nlsadmin\f1 \f4\-r\f1 \f2service_code \f2net_spec\f1
removes the entry for the \f2service_code\f1 from that listener's
list of services.
This is normally done only in conjunction with the
deinstallation of a service from a machine.
.br

.TP
\f4nlsadmin\f1 \f4\-e\f1 \f2service_code \f2net_spec\f1
.PD 0
.TP
\f4nlsadmin\f1 \f4\-d\f1 \f2service_code \f2net_spec\f1
.PD
enables or disables (respectively) the service indicated by
\f2service_code\f1 for the specified network.
The service must previously have been added to the listener for that
network (see the \f4\-a\f1 option, above).
Disabling a service will cause subsequent service requests for that
service to be denied, but the processes from any prior service requests
that are still running will continue unaffected.
.TP
\f4nlsadmin\f1 \f4\-s\f1 \f2net_spec\f1
.PD 0
.TP
\f4nlsadmin\f1 \f4\-k\f1 \f2net_spec\f1
.PD
starts and kills (respectively) the listener process for the
indicated network.
These operations will normally be performed as part of the system
startup and shutdown procedures.
Before a listener can be started for a particular network, it must first
have been initialized (see the \f4\-i\f1 option, above).
When a listener is killed, processes that are still running as a result
of prior service requests will continue unaffected.
.PP
Under the Service Access Facility, it is possible to have multiple 
instances of the listener on a single \f2net_spec\fP.
In any of the above commands, the option \f4\-N \f2port_monitor_tag\f1
may be used in place of the \f2net_spec\fP argument.
This argument specifies the tag by which 
an instance of the listener is identified
by the Service Access Facility.
If the \f4\-N\fP option is not specified (i.e., the \f2net_spec\fP is
specified in the invocation), then it will be assumed that the last
component of the \f2net_spec\fP represents the tag of the listener for
which the operation is destined.
In other words, it is assumed that there is at least one listener on
a designated \f2net_spec\fP, and that its tag is identical to the last
component of the \f2net_spec\fP.
This listener may be thought of as the primary, or default, listener for
a particular \f2net_spec\fP.
.PP
\f4nlsadmin\f1 is also used in conjunction with the Service Access
Facility commands.
In that capacity, the following combinations of options can be used:
.TP
\f4nlsadmin\f1 \f4\-V\f1
writes the current version number of the listener's administrative
file to the standard
output.
It is used as part of the \f4sacadm\fP command line when \f4sacadm\fP add a 
port monitor to the system.
.PP
\f4nlsadmin\f1 \f4\-c \f2cmd\f1 | \f4\-o\f1 \f2streamname\f1 [\f4\-p\f1 \f2modules\f1] [\f4\-A\f1 \f2address\f1 | \f4\-D\f1 ] \e
.br
\0\0\0[ \f4\-R\f1 \f2prognum\f4:\f2versnum\f1 ]
.PD 0
.IP
formats the port monitor-specific information to be used as an
argument to \f4pmadm\fP(1M).
.PD
.IP
The \f4\-c\f1 option specifies the full path name of the server
and its arguments.
\f2cmd\f1 must appear as a single word to the shell,
and its arguments must therefor be
surrounded by quotes.
.IP
The \f4\-o\f1 option specifies the full path name of a FIFO or
named \s-1STREAM\s0 through which a standing server is actually
receiving the connection.
.IP
If the \f4\-p\f1 option is specified, then \f2modules\f1 will be
interpreted as a list of \s-1STREAMS\s0 modules for the listener to push
before starting the service being added.
The modules are pushed in the order in which they are specified.
\f2modules\f1 must be a comma-separated list, with no white
space included.
.IP
If the \f4\-A\f1 option is specified, then \f2address\f1 will be
interpreted as the server's private address.
The listener will monitor this address on behalf of the service and will
dispatch all calls arriving on this address directly to the designated
service.
This option may not be used in conjunction with the \f4\-D\fP option.
.IP
If the \f4\-D\fP option is specified, then the service is assigned a
private address dynamically, that is,
the listener will have the transport provider select the
address each time the listener begins listening on behalf of this
service.
For RPC services, this option will be often be used
in conjunction with the \f4\-R\fP option to register the
dynamically assigned address with the rpcbinder.
This option may not be used in conjunction with the \f4\-A\fP option.
.IP
When the \f4\-R\fP option is specified, the service is an RPC service
whose address, program number, and version number should be registered
with the rpcbinder for this transport provider.
This registration is performed each time the listener begins listening
on behalf of ththe service.
\f2prognum\fP and \f2versnum\fP are the program number and version
number, respectively, of the RPC service.
.PP
\f4nlsadmin\f1 may be invoked by any user to generate reports but all
operations that affect a listener's status or configuration are
restricted to privileged users.
.P
The options specific to the Service Access Facility may not be
mixed with any other options.

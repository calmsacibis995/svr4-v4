.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\f2generic_options\fP are options supported by the generic \f4mount\fP command.
\f4mount\f1
attaches a 
\f4ufs\f1
file system, referenced by \f2special\fP, to the file system hierarchy at the
pathname location
.IR mount_point ,
which must already exist.
If
.I mount_point
has any contents prior to the
\f4mount\f1
operation, these remain hidden until the
file system is once again unmounted.
.P
The options are:
.PP
.TP 0.50i
\f4\-F ufs\f1
Specifies the \f4ufs\f1-FSType.
.TP
\f4\-r\f1
Mount the file system read-only.
.TP
\f4\-o\f1
Specify the \f4ufs\f1
file system specific options in a comma-separated list.
If invalid options are specified, a warning message
is printed and the invalid options are ignored.
The following options are available:
.RS
.TP 0.75i
\f4f\f1
Fake an
\f4/etc/mnttab\f1
entry, but do not actually mount any file systems.
Parameters are not verified.
.TP
\f4n\f1
Mount the file system without making an entry in
\f4/etc/mnttab\f1.
.TP
\f4rw\f1\||\|\f4ro\f1
Read/write or read-only.
Default is \f4rw\f1.
.TP
\f4nosuid\f1
By default the file system is mounted with setuid execution allowed.
Specifying \f4nosuid\fP overrides the default and causes the
file system to be mounted with setuid execution disallowed.
.TP
\f4remount\f1
Used in conjunction with \f4rw\f1.
A file system 
mounted read-only can be \f2remounted\f1 read-write.
Fails if the
file system is not currently mounted
or if the file system is mounted \f4rw\f1.
.RE
.SH NOTES
If the directory on which a file system is to be mounted is a
symbolic link, the file system is mounted on
the directory to which the symbolic link refers,
rather than on top of the symbolic link itself.

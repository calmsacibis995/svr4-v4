.br
\f4getvol \f1[\f4\-f\f1\||\ \f4\-F\f1] [\f4\-wo\f1] [\f4\-l \f2label\f1\||\ \f4\-x \f2label\f1\|] \f2device\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION

verifies that the specified device is accessible and that a volume of the
appropriate medium has been inserted.
The command is interactive and displays instructional prompts, describes

Options and arguments for this command are:
.TP 8
\f4\-n\f1
Runs the command in non-interactive mode.
The volume is assumed to be inserted
upon command invocation.
.TP 8
\f4\-l\f1
Specifies that the label \f2label\f1 must
exist on the inserted volume (can be overriden by the \-o option).
.TP 8
\f4\-f\f1
Formats the volume after insertion, using the format command defined for this
device in the device table.
.TP 8
\f4\-F\f1
Formats the volume after insertion and places a file system on the device.
Also uses the format command defined for this device in the device table.
.TP 8
\f4\-w\f1
Allows administrator to write a new label on the device.
User is prompted to supply the label text.
This option is ineffective if the \f4-n\f1 option is enabled.
.TP 8
\f4\-o\f1

.TP 8
\f4\-x\f1
Specifies that the label \f2label\f1 must exist on the device.
This option should be used in place of the \f4\-l\f1 option when
the label can only be verified by visual means.
Use of the option causes a message to be displayed
asking the administrator to visually verify
that the label is indeed \f2label\f1.
.TP 8
\f2device\f1
Names the device which should be verified for accessibility.
.SH ERRORS
The command will exit with one of the following values:
.TP 4
\f40\f1 = 
successful completion of the task.
.TP 4

command syntax incorrect,
invalid option used,
or internal error occurred.
.TP 4
\f43\f1 =

.SH NOTES 
This command uses the device table to determine the characteristics of the
device when performing the volume label checking.

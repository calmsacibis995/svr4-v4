.SH NAME
\f4rmount\f1 \- queue remote resource mounts
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/usr/sbin/rmount\f1 [\f4\-d\f1[\f4r\f1] \f2resource directory\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4rmount\f1 queues a remote resource for mounting. 
The command enters the
resource request into \f4/etc/rfs/rmnttab\f1, which is formatted
identically to \f4mnttab\f1(4).  \f4rmnttry\f1(1M) is used to poll
entries in this file.
.P
When used without arguments, \f4rmount\f1 prints a list of resources
with pending mounts 
along with their destined directories, modes, and date of request.  The
resources are listed chronologically, with the oldest resource request
appearing first.
.P
The following options are available:
.TP
\f4\-d\f1
indicates that the \f2resource\f1 is a remote resource to be mounted on
\f4directory\fP.
.TP
\f4\-r\f1
indicates that the \f2resource\f1 is to be mounted read-only.  If the
\f2resource\f1 is write-protected, this flag must be used.

.SH NAME
\f4fdp\f1 \- create, or restore from, a full file system archive
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4fdp \-B \f1[\f4\-dovAENS\f1]
[\f4\-c\f2 count\f1]
\f2bkjobid odpname odpdev odplab descript
.PP
\f4fdp \-RC \f1[\f4\-dovAENS\f1] [\f4\-c\f2 count\f1]
\f2odpname odpdev redpname redev rsjobid descript\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4fdp\fP command is invoked as a child process by other
shell commands.
The command name, \f4fdp\fP, is read either from the
\f2bkhist.tab\f1 file or the \f4bkreg -m\f1 command and option.
The \f4 -B, -R, \f1and \f4-C \f1options
are passed to \f4fdp\fP by
the shell commands \f4backup\fP, and \f4restore\fP.
The other options are passed from the
\f4bkhist.tab\f1 file or the \f4bkreg -p\f1 command and option.
The arguments are sent to \f4fdp\fP from various locations
in the backup service.
.PP
\f4fdp \-B\f1 is invoked as a child process by
the \f4backdaemon\fP command to perform a backup of the data partition
.I odpdev
(the originating data partition).
All blocks in
the data partition are archived.
The resulting backup is created in the format described on \f4dd\fP(1).
The backup is recorded in the backup history log,
\f4/etc/bkup/bkhist.tab\fP.
.PP
\f4fdp \-RC\f1 is invoked as a child process by the \f4rsoper\fP
command to restore the entire data partition from an archive
created by \f4fdp \-B\f1.
The data partition archive is assumed to be in the format described
on \f4dd\fP(1).
.I
dd(1)
format.
.P
The arguments to \f4fdp\fP are defined as follows:
.TP 0.7i
.I bkjobid
the job id assigned by \f2backup\fP.
The method uses the \f2bkjobid\f1 when it creates
history log entries.
.TP
.I odpname
the name of the data partition that is to be backed up.
Unused by \f4fdp\fP, but supplied by \f4backup\f1
for command-line compatibility with other archiving methods.
.TP
.I odpdev
the name of the
block special device on which the data partition resides.
.TP
.I odplab
the volume name on the file system [see \f4labelit\fP(1M)].
Unused by \f4fdp\fP, but supplied by \f4backup\f1
for command-line compatibility with other archiving methods.
.TP
.I descript
is a description for a destination device in the form:
.sp .5
.nf
.I
	dgroup:dname:dchar:dlabels
.fi
.sp .5
.I dgroup
specifies a device group [see \f4devgroup.tab\fP(4)].
.br
\f2dname\fP
specifies a particular device name [see \f4device.tab\fP(4)].
.br
.I dchars
specifies characteristics associated with the device.
If specified, \f2dchar\f1
overrides the defaults for the specified device and group.
[See \f4device.tab\fP(4)
for a further description of device characteristics].
.br
.I dlabels
specifies the volume names
for the media to be used for reading or writing the archive.
.TP
.I rsjobid
the job id assigned by \f4restore\fP.
.TP
.I redev
if non-null, the partition to be restored to instead of
.IR ofsdev .
.TP
.I redpname
unused, but provided for consistency with other methods.
.SS Options
Some options are only significant during \f4fdp \-B\f1
invocations;  they are accepted but ignored during
\f4fdp \-R\f1 invocations because the command is invoked
and options are specified automatically by \f4restore\fP.
These options are flagged with an asterisk (*).
.TP 10
\f4c*\f2count\f1
Archives or restores only the first \f2count\f1
(512 byte) blocks of data in the data partition.
.TP 10
\f4d*\f1
Inhibits recording the archive in the backup history log.
.TP 10
\f4o\f1
Permits the user to override media insertion requests [see
\f4getvol\fP(1M) and the description of the \f4\-o\fP option].
.TP 10
\f4v*\f1
Validates the archive as it is written.
A checksum is computed as the archive is being written;
as each medium is completed, it is re-read and the checksum
recomputed to verify that each block is readable and correct.
If either check fails, the medium is considered unreadable.
If \f4-A\f1 has been specified, the archiving operation fails;
otherwise, the operator is prompted to replace the failed medium.
.TP 10
\f4A\f1
Establishes automated mode,
(that is, does not prompt the user to insert or remove media).
.TP 10
\f4E*\f1
Reports an estimate of media usage for the archive;
then performs the backup.
.TP 10
\f4N*\f1
Reports an estimate of media usage for the archive;
does not perform the backup.
.TP 10
\f4S\f1
Displays
a period (.) for every 100 (512 byte) blocks read-from or written-to
the archive on the destination device.
.SS User Interactions
The connection between an archiving method and
\f4backup\fP is more complex than a simple fork/exec or pipe.
The \f4backup\fP command
is responsible for all interactions with the user,
either directly, or through the \f4bkoper\fP command.
Therefore, \f4fdp\fP
neither reads from standard-input nor writes to standard-output or
standard-error.
A method library must be used [see \f4libbrmeth\fP(3)]
to communicate reports (estimates, filenames, periods, status, and so on)
to \f4backup\fP.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The exit codes for \f4fdp\fP are the following:
.PD 0
.TP 5
0
successful completion of the task
.TP
1
one or more parameters to \f4fdp\fP are invalid.
.TP
2
an error has occurred which caused \f4fdp\fP to fail to
complete all portions of its task.
.PD

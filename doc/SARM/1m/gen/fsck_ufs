.SH DESCRIPTION
.I generic_options
are options supported by the generic \f4fsck\f1 command.
\f2current_options\f1
are options supported by the \f4s5\f1-specific module of the \f4fsck\f1 command.
.PP
\f4fsck\f1
audits and interactively repairs inconsistent conditions on
file systems.
In this case, it asks for confirmation before attempting
any corrections.
Inconsistencies other than those mentioned above
can often result in some loss of data.
The amount and severity of data
lost can be determined from the diagnostic output.
.LP
\f4fsck\f1
corrects innocuous inconsistencies such as: unreferenced inodes,
too-large link counts in inodes, missing blocks in the
free list, blocks appearing in the free list and also
in files, or incorrect counts in the super block, automatically. 
It displays a message for each inconsistency corrected that
identifies the nature of, and file system on which, the correction
is to take place.
After successfully correcting a file system,
\f4fsck\f1
prints the number of files on that file system,
the number of used and free blocks,
and the percentage of fragmentation.
.LP
The default action for each correction is to wait for the operator to
respond either
\f4yes\f1
or
\f4no\f1.
If the operator does not have write permission on the file system,
\f4fsck\f1
will default to a 
\f4\-n\f1
(no corrections) action.
.LP
Inconsistencies checked are as follows:
.RS
.TP
.PD 0
\(bu
Blocks claimed by more than one inode or the free list.
.TP
\(bu
Blocks claimed by an inode or the free list outside the range of the file system.
.TP
\(bu
Incorrect link counts.
.TP
\(bu
Incorrect directory sizes.
.TP
\(bu
Bad inode format.
.TP
\(bu
Blocks not accounted for anywhere.
.TP
\(bu
Directory checks, file pointing to unallocated inode,
inode number out of range, absence of 
\f1`\f4.\f1'
and
\f1`\f4.\|.\f1'
as the first two entries in each directory.
.TP
\(bu
Super Block checks:
more blocks for inodes than there are in the file system.
.TP
\(bu
Bad free block list format.
.TP
\(bu
Total free block and/or free inode count incorrect.
.PD
.RE
.LP
Orphaned files and directories (allocated but unreferenced) are,
with the operator's concurrence, reconnected by
placing them in the 
\f4lost+found\f1
directory.
The name assigned is the inode number.  If the
\f4lost+found\f1
directory does not exist, it is created.
If there is insufficient space its size is increased.
.LP
A file system may be specified by giving the name of the
block or character special device
on which it resides, or by giving the name of its mount point.
.P
The options are:
.PP
.TP
\f4\-F ufs\f1
Specifies the \f4ufs\f1-FSType.
.TP
\f4\-y | -Y\f1
Assume a yes response to all questions asked by \f4fsck\fP.
.TP
\f4\-n | -N\f1
Assume a no response to all questions asked by \f4fsck\fP;
do not open the file system for writing.
.TP
\f4\-o\f1
Specify
\f4ufs\f1
file system specific suboptions.
These suboptions can be any combination of the
following:
.RS
.TP
\f4p\f1
Check the filesystem non-interactively.
Exit if there is a problem requiring intervention.
.TP
\f4b=\f2#\f1
Use the block specified as
the super block for the file system.
Block 32 is always an alternate super block.
.RE
.SH NOTES
Checking the character special device is almost always faster.

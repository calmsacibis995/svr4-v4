.SH NAME
\f4mountd\f1 \- NFS mount request server
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4mountd \f1
[
\f4\-n \f1
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\f4mountd\f1
is an
.SM RPC
server that answers file system mount requests.
It reads the file
\f4/etc/dfs/sharetab\f1,
described in
\f4sharetab\f1(4),
to determine which file systems
are available for mounting by which machines.
It also provides information
as to what file systems are mounted by which clients.
This information can be printed using the
\f4dfmounts\f1(1M)
command.
.LP
The
\f4mountd\f1
daemon is automatically invoked in run level 3.
.LP
With the
\f4\-n\f1
option,
\f4mountd\f1
does not check that the clients are root users.
Though this option makes
things slightly less secure,
it does allow older versions (pre-3.0) of client
NFS to work.

.SH NAME
\f4shutdown\f1 \- shut down system, change system state
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4shutdown\f1
[
\f4\-y\f1
]
[
\f4\-g\f2grace_period
[
\f4\-i\f2init_state\f1
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This command is executed by the super-user to change the state of the
machine.
In most cases, it is used to change from the multi-user state
(state 2) to another state (see below).
.P
By default, it brings the system to a state where only the console has
access to the UNIX system.
This state is called single-user (see below).
.PP
The command sends a warning message and a final message before it starts
actual shutdown activities.
By default, the command asks for confirmation before it starts shutting down
daemons and killing processes.
The options are used as follows:
.PP
.TP .5i
\f4\-y\f1
pre-answers the confirmation question so the command
can be run without user intervention.
A default of 60 seconds is allowed between the warning message and
the final message.
Another 60 seconds is allowed between the final message and the
confirmation.
.TP .5i
\f4\-g\f2grace_period\f1
allows the super-user to change the number of seconds from the
60-second default.
.TP .5i
\f4\-i\f2init_state\f1
specifies the state that
\f4init\fP is to be put in following the warnings, if any.
By default, system state ``\f4s\f1'' is used.
.PP
Other recommended system state definitions are:
.TP .5i
state 0
Shut the machine down so it is safe to remove the power.
Have the machine remove power if it can.
The \f4rc0\f1 procedure is called to do this work.
.TP .5i
state 1
State 1 is referred to as the administrative state.
In state 1 filesystems required for multi-user operations
are mounted, and logins
requiring access to multi-user filesystems can be used.
When the system comes up from firmware mode into state 1,
only the console is active and other multi-user (state 2)
services are unavailable.
Note that not all user processes are stopped when transitioning from
multi-user state to state 1.  
.TP .5i
state s, S
State s (or S) is referred to as the single-user state.
All user processes are stopped on transitions to this state.
In the single-user state, filesystems required for multi-user logins
are unmounted
and the system can only be accessed through the console.
Logins requiring access to multi-user file systems cannot be used.
.TP .5i
state 5
Stop the UNIX system and go to firmware mode.
.TP .5i
state 6
Stop the UNIX system and reboot to the state defined by the
\f4initdefault\f1 entry in \f4/etc/inittab\f1;  configure a new
bootable operating system, if necessary, before the reboot.
The \f4rc6\f1 procedure is called to do this work.
.SH NOTES
\f4shutdown\fP(1M) behaves differently depending on the number of
users logged in.  If several users are logged in, three messages
are displayed, warning, final and confirmation, with grace period
between each message.  If only the user issuing \f4shutdown\fP(1M)
is logged in, two messages are displayed, the final and confirmation
message, with grace period between them.

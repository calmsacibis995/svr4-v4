.SH NAME
\f4rfudaemon\f1 \- Remote File Sharing daemon process
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/etc/rfs/rfudaemon\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4rfudaemon\f1 command is started automatically by \f4rfstart\f1(1M)
and runs as a daemon process as long as Remote File Sharing is active.
Its function is to listen for unexpected events, such as broken
network connections and forced unmounts, and execute appropriate administrative
procedures.
.P
When such an event occurs, \f4rfudaemon\f1 executes the administrative
shell script \f4rfuadmin\f1, with arguments that identify the event.
This command is not intended to be run from the shell.
Here are the events:
.TP 0.8i
\f4DISCONNECT\f1
A link to a remote resource has been cut.  \f4rfudaemon\f1
executes\p
\%\f4rfuadmin\f1, with two arguments:  \f4disconnect\f1
and the name of the disconnected resource.
.TP 0.8i
\f4FUMOUNT\f1
A remote server machine has forced an unmount of a resource
a local machine has mounted.  \f4rfudaemon\f1
executes \f4rfuadmin\f1, with two arguments:  \f4fumount\f1
and the name of the disconnected resource.
.TP 0.8i
\f4GETUMSG\f1
A remote user-level program has sent a message
to the local \f4rfudaemon\f1.  Currently the only message sent
is \f2fuwarn\f1, which notifies \f4rfuadmin\f1 that a
resource is about to be unmounted.  It sends \f4rfuadmin\f1 the
\f2fuwarn\f1, the resource name, and the number of seconds in which
the forced unmount will occur.
.TP 0.8i
\f4LASTUMSG\f1
The local machine wants to stop the \f4rfudaemon\f1 [\f4rfstop\f1(1M)].
This causes \f4rfudaemon\f1 to exit.

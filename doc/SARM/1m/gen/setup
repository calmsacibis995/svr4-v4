.SH NAME
\f4setup\f1 \- initialize system for first user
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4setup\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4setup\f1 command, which is also accessible as a login by the same name,
allows the first user to be established as the "owner" of the machine.
.PP
The user can then set the date, time and time zone of the machine.
.PP
The user can then set the node name of the machine.
.PP
The user can then protect the system from unauthorized modification
of the machine configuration and software by giving passwords
to the administrative and maintenance functions.
Normally, the first user of the machine
enters this command through the setup login,
which initially has no password,
and then gives passwords to the various functions
in the system.
Any that the user leaves without password protection can be
exercised by anyone.
.PP
The user can then give passwords to system logins such as
"root", "bin", etc.
(\f2provided they do not already have passwords\f1).
Once given a password,
each login can only be changed by that login or "root".
.PP
Finally, the user is permitted to add the first logins to the system,
usually starting with his or her own.
.SH SEE ALSO
\f4passwd\f1(1).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The \f4passwd\f1(1) command complains if the password provided does not meet its standards.
.SH NOTES
If the setup login is not under password control,
anyone can put passwords on the other functions.

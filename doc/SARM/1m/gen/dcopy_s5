[\f4\-a\f2n\f1]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I generic_options
are options supported by the generic \f4dcopy\f1 command.
.PP
With no options,
\f4dcopy\f1
copies files from
.I inputfs
compressing directories by removing vacant entries, and spacing consecutive
blocks in a file by the optimal rotational gap.
.PP
The options are:
.TP 5P
\f4\-F s5\f1
Specifies the \f4s5\f1-FSType.
Need not be supplied if the information may be obtained
from \f4/etc/vfstab\f1 by matching the \f2inputfs\f1 device
with an entry in the file.
.TP 
\f4\-s\f2X\f1
Supply device information for creating an optimal
organization of blocks in a file.
.I X
must be of the form \f2cylinder size\f1:\f2gap size\f1.
.TP 
\f4\-a\f2n\f1
Place the files not accessed in
.I n
days after the free blocks of the 
destination file system
If no
.I n 
is specified then no movement occurs.
.TP 
\f4\-d\f1
Leave order of directory entries as is.
The default is to move sub-directories to the beginning of directories.
.TP
\f4\-v\f1
Reports how many files were processed and how big
the source and destination freelists are.
.TP
\f4\-f\f2 fsize\f1[:\f2isize\f1]\fP
Specify the
.I outputfs
file system (\f2fsize\fP) and inode list (\f2isize\fP) sizes in logical blocks.
If the suboption (or :\f2isize\fP)
is not given, the values from
.I inputfs
are used.
.P
\f4dcopy\f1
catches interrupts and quits and reports on its progress.
To terminate
\f4dcopy\f1,
send a quit signal followed by an
interrupt or quit.
.ig
\f4dcopy\f1
also attempts to modify its command line arguments so its 
progress can be monitored with
.IR ps (1).
..
.SH NOTES
\f4fsck\fP should be run on the new file system
created by \f4dcopy\fP before it is mounted.
.SH FILES
\f4/etc/mnttab\f1	list of file systems currently mounted

.SH DESCRIPTION
In the first instance,
\f4sar\fP
samples cumulative activity counters in the operating system
at
.I n
intervals of
.I t
seconds, where \f2t\f1 should be 5 or greater.
If \f2t\f1 is specified with more than one option,
all headers are printed together and the output may be difficult to read.
(If the sampling interval is less than 5, the activity of
\f4sar\fP
itself may affect the sample.)
If the
\f4\-o\f1
option is specified, it saves
the samples in
.I file
in binary format.
The default value of
.I n
is 1.
In the second instance, with no sampling interval specified,
\f4sar\f1
extracts data from a previously
recorded
.IR file,
either the one specified
by the
\f4\-f\f1
option
or, by default,
the standard system activity daily data file
\f4/var/adm/sa/sa\f2dd\f1
for the current day
.IR dd.
The starting and ending times of the report
can be bounded via the
\f4\-s\f1
and
\f4\-e\f1
.I time
arguments of the form
.IR hh [: mm [: ss ]].\^
The
\f4\-i\f1
option selects records at
.I sec
second intervals.
Otherwise, all intervals found in the data file are reported.
.PP
In either case,
subsets of data to be printed are specified by option:

.TP 5
\f4\-u\f1
Report
.SM CPU
utilization (the default):
.br
\f4%usr\f1, \f4%sys\f1, \f4%wio\f1, \f4%idle\f1 \- portion of time running in user mode,
running in system mode, idle with some process waiting for block
.SM I/O,
and otherwise idle.
When used with \f4\-D\f1, \f4%sys\f1 is split into
percent of time servicing requests from remote machines
(\f4%sys\f1 remote) and all other system time (\f4%sys\f1 local).
If you are using an AT&T 3B2 Computer with a co-processor,
the CPU utilization (default) report will contain the following fields:
.br
\f4%usr\f1,
\f4%sys\f1, \f4%idle\f1, \f4scall\f1/\f4s\f1 \- where \f4scalls\f1/\f4s\f1 is the number of
system calls, of all types, encountered on the co-processor per second.
.TP
\f4\-b\f1
Report buffer activity:
.br
\f4bread\f1/\f4s\f1, \f4bwrit\f1/\f4s\f1 \- transfers per second of data between system buffers
and disk or other block devices;

that is, (\f41\-bread\f1/\f4lread\f1) as a percentage;
.br
\f4pread\f1/\f4s\f1, \f4pwrit\f1/\f4s\f1 \-

When used with \f4\-D\f1, buffer caching is reported for
locally-mounted remote resources.
.TP
\f4\-d\f1
Report activity for each block device, for example, disk or tape drive, with
the exception of XDC disks and tape drives.
When data is displayed, the device specification
.I dsk\-
is generally used to represent a disk drive.
The device specification used to represent a tape drive is machine
dependent.
The activity data reported is:
.br
\f4%busy\f1, \f4avque\f1 \- portion of time device was busy servicing a transfer request,
ratio of total time for all requests to complete to total time device
was busy servicing these requests.

number of bytes transferred in 512-byte units;
.br
.ne.5i

that transfer requests wait idly on queue,
and average time to be serviced
(which for disks includes
seek, rotational latency and data transfer times).

specific system calls;
.br
\f4rchar\f1/\f4s\f1, \f4wchar\f1/\f4s\f1 \- characters transferred by read and write

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The 
\f4share\f1
command makes local resources available
for mounting by remote systems.
.LP
If no argument is specified, then 
\f4share\f1
displays all resources currently shared,
including NFS resources and resources shared through 
other distributed file system packages.
.LP
The following options are recognized:
.TP
\f4\-o\f2 specific_options\f1
Specify options in a comma-separated list of keywords
and attribute-value-assertions for interpretation by
the file-system-type-specific command.
.IP
.I specific_options
can be any combination of the following:
.RS .5i
.TP
\f4rw\f1
Sharing will be read-write to all clients.
.TP
\f4rw=\f2client\fR[\f4:\f2client\fR].\|.\|.\f1
Sharing will be read-write to the listed clients;
overrides the
\f4ro\f1
suboption for the clients specified.
.TP
\f4ro\f1
Sharing will be read-only to all clients.
.TP
\f4ro=\f2client\fR[\f4:\f2client\fR].\|.\|.\f1
Sharing will be read-only to the listed clients;
overrides the 
\f4rw\f1
suboption for the clients specified.
.TP
\f4anon=\f2uid\f1
Set 
.I uid
to be the effective user
.SM ID
of unathenticated users if
.SM AUTH_DES
authentication is used,
or to be root if
.SM AUTH_UNIX
authentication is used.
By default, unknown users are given the effective
user
.SM ID
\s-1\f4UID_NOBODY\f1\s0.
If 
.I uid
is set to
\f4\-1\f1,
access is denied.
.TP
\f4root=\f2host\fR[\f4:\f2host\fR]\|.\|.\|.\f1
Only root users from the specified hosts
will have root access.
By default, no host has root access.
.TP
\f4secure\f1
Clients must use the
\s-1AUTH_DES\s0
authentication of \s-1RPC\s0.
\s-1AUTH_UNIX\s0
authentication is the default.
.RE
.IP
If 
.I specific_options
is not specified, then by default sharing will be 
read-write to all clients.
.TP 12
\f4\-d\f2 description\f1
Provide a comment that describes the resource to be shared.
.TP
.I pathname
Specify the pathname of the resource to be
shared.

.SH NOTES
The command will fail if both
\f4ro\f1
and 
\f4rw\f1
are specified.  If the same client name exists in both the
\f4ro=\f1
and 
\f4rw=\f1
lists,
the \f4rw\f1 will override the \f4ro\f1, giving read/write 
access to the client
specified.
.LP
\f4ro=\f1, \f4rw=\f1, and \f4root=\f1 are guaranteed to work
over UDP but may not work over other transport
providers.
.LP
If a resource is shared with a \f4ro=\f1 list and a \f4root=\f1 list,
any host that is on the \f4root=\f1 list will be given only read-only
access, regardless of whether that host is specified in the \f4ro=\f1
list, unless \f4rw\f1 is declared as the default, or 
the host is mentioned in a \f4rw=\f1 list. 
The same is true if the resource is shared with \f4ro\f1
as the default. For example, the following \f4share\f1 commands will
give read-only permissions to \f4hostb\f1:
.IP
\f4share -F nfs -oro=hosta,root=hostb /var
.IP
share -F nfs -oro,root=hostb /var\f1
.P
While the following will give read/write permissions to hostb:
.IP
\f4share -F nfs -oro=hosta,rw=hostb,root=hostb /var
.IP
share -F nfs -oroot=hostb /var\f1

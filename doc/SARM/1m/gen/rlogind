.SH NAME
\f4rlogind\f1 \- remote login server
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4in.rlogind\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4rlogind\f1
is the server for the
\f4rlogin\f1(1)
program.  The server provides a remote login facility
with authentication based on privileged port numbers.
.LP
\f4rlogind\f1
is invoked by
\f4inetd\f1(1M)
when a remote login connection is established,
and executes the following protocol:
.TP
1)
The server checks the remote client's source port.
If the port is not in the range 0-1023, the server
aborts the connection.
.TP
2)
The server checks the remote client's source address.
If an entry for the client exists in both
\f4/etc/hosts\f1 and \f4/etc/hosts.equiv\f1, a user logging
in from the client is not prompted for a password.
If the address is associated with a host for which no
corresponding entry exists in \f4/etc/hosts\f1,
the user is prompted for a password, regardless of 
whether or not an entry for the remote client is present in 
\f4/etc/hosts.equiv\f1 [see \f4hosts\f1(4) and \f4hosts.equiv\f1(4)].
.LP
Once the source port and address have been checked,
\f4rlogind\f1
allocates a pseudo-terminal
and manipulates file descriptors so that the slave
half of the pseudo-terminal becomes the
\f4stdin\f1,
\f4stdout\f1,
and
\f4stderr\f1
for a login process.
.P
The login process is an instance of the
\f4in.login\fP program, which is based on \f4login\fP(1).
The login process is invoked with the \f4\-r\f1 option to indicate
that it is originated by \f4rlogind\fP.
The login process proceeds with the authentication
process as described in
\f4rshd\f1(1M),
but if automatic authentication fails, it reprompts the user
to login as one finds on a standard terminal line.
.LP
\f4rlogind\fP manipulates the master side of
the pseudo-terminal, operating as an intermediary
between the login process and the remote client's 
\f4rlogin\f1
program.  In normal operation, a packet protocol
is invoked to provide
\f4Ctrl-S\f1 / \f4Ctrl-Q\f1
type facilities and propagate
interrupt signals to the remote programs.  The login process
propagates the client terminal's baud rate and terminal type,
as found in the environment variable,
\f4TERM\s0\fR;\f1
see
\f4environ\f1(4).

\f4inetd\f1(1M), \f4hosts\f1(4), \f4hosts.equiv\f1(4)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
All diagnostic messages are returned on the connection
associated with the
\f4stderr\f1,
after which any network connections are closed.
An error is indicated by a leading byte with a value of 1.
.TP
\f4Hostname for your address unknown.\f1
No entry in the host name database existed for
the client's machine.
.TP
\f4Try again.\f1
A
.I fork
by the server failed.
.TP
\f4/usr/bin/sh:\f1 .\|.\|.
The user's login shell could not be started.
.SH NOTES
The authentication procedure used here assumes the integrity
of each client machine and the connecting medium.  This is
insecure, but is useful in an ``open'' environment.
.LP
A facility to allow all data exchanges to be encrypted should be
present.

.SH NAME
\f4idload\f1 \- Remote File Sharing user and group mapping
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4idload\f1
[\f4\-n\f1] [\f4\-g \f2g_rules\f1] [\f4\-u \f2u_rules\f1] [\|\f4directory\fP]
.br
\f4idload \-k\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4idload\f1 is used on Remote File Sharing server machines to 
build translation tables for user and group ids.  It takes your 
\f4/etc/passwd\f1 and \f4/etc/group\f1 files and produces translation 
tables for user and group ids from remote machines, according to the rules
set down in the \f2u_rules\f1 and \f2g_rules\f1 files.  If you are mapping by
user and group name, you will need copies of remote \f4/etc/passwd\f1
and \f4/etc/group\f1 files.
If no rules files are specified, remote user and group ids are mapped to
MAXUID+1 (this is an id number that is one higher than the highest number
you could assign on your system.)
.P
By default, the remote password and group files are assumed to
reside in \f4/etc/rfs/auth.info/\f2domain\f1/\f2nodename\f1/[\f4passwd\f1\|| \f4group\f1].
The \f4directory\fP argument indicates that some directory structure
other than \f4/etc/rfs/auth.info\f1 contains the
\f2domain\f1/\f2nodename\f1 \f4passwd\f1 and \f4group\f1 files.
(\f2nodename\f1 is the name of the computer the files are from and
\f2domain\f1 is the domain that computer is a member of.)
.P
You must run \f4idload\f1 to put the mapping into place.
Global mapping will take effect immediately
for machines that have one of your resources currently mounted.
Mapping for other specific machines will take effect when
each machine mounts one of your resources.
.TP .75i
\f4\-n\f1
This is used to do a trial run of the id mapping.
No translation table will be produced, however, a display of
the mapping is output to the terminal (\f2stdout\f1).
.TP
\f4\-k\f1
This is used to print the idmapping that is currently in use.
(Specific mapping for remote machines will not be shown until
that machine mounts one of your resources.)
.TP
\f4\-u \f2u_rules\f1
The \f2u_rules\f1 file contains the rules for user id translation.
The default rules file is \f4/etc/rfs/auth.info/uid.rules\f1.
.TP
\f4\-g \f2g_rules\f1
The \f2g_rules\f1 file contains the rules for group id translation.
The default rules file is \f4/etc/rfs/auth.info/gid.rules\f1.
.P
This command is restricted to the super-user.
.P
.SH Rules
The rules files have two types of sections (both optional):
\f4global\f1 and \f4host\f1.  There can be only one global
section, though there can be one host section for each computer
you want to map.
.P
The \f4global\f1 section describes the default conditions for translation
for any machines that are not explicitly referenced in a \f4host\f1 section.
If the global section is missing, the default action is to map all remote
user and group ids from\p
.br
.ne 1.5i
undefined computers to MAXUID+1.
The syntax of the first line of the \f4global\f1 section is:
.IP
\f4global\f1
.P
A \f4host\f1 section is used for each machine or group
of machines that you want to map differently from the global definitions.
The syntax of the first line of each \f4host\f1 section is:
.IP
\f4host\f1 \f2name\f1 ...
.P
where \f2name\f1 is replaced by the full name of a
computer (\f2domain.nodename\f1).  
.P
The format of a rules file is described below. (All lines are
optional, but must appear in the order shown.)
.nf

\f4global
default \f2local | \f4transparent 
exclude \f2remote_id-remote_id\f1 | \f2remote_id\f1
\f4map\f1 \f2remote_id:local\f1
.sp
\f4host \f2domain.nodename \f1[\f2domain.nodename...\f1]
\f4default \f2local | \f4transparent 
exclude \f2remote_id-remote_id\f1 | \f2remote_id\f1 | \f2remote_name\f1
\f4map\f1 \f2remote:local\f1 | \f2remote\f1 | \f4all\f1

.fi
Each of these instruction types is described below.
.P
The line 
.IP
\f4default \f2local | \f4transparent \f1
.P
defines the mode of mapping for remote users that are not
specifically mapped in instructions in other lines.
\f4transparent\f1 means that each remote
user and group id will have the same numeric value locally unless it
appears in the \f4exclude\f1 instruction.
\f2local\f1 can be replaced by a local user name or id to map all
users into a particular local name or id number.
If the default line is omitted, all users that are not specifically
mapped are mapped into a "special guest" login id.
.P
The line 
.IP
\f4exclude \f2remote_id-remote_id\f1 | \f2remote_id\f1 | \f2remote_name\f1
.P
defines remote ids that will be excluded from the \f4default\f1 mapping.
The \f4exclude\f1 instruction must precede any
\f4map\f1 instructions in a block.  You can use a range of id numbers,
a single id number, or a single name.  (\f2remote_name\f1 cannot be used in
a \f4global\f1 block.)
.P
The line 
.IP
\f4map \f2remote:local\f1 | \f2remote\f1 | \f4all\f1
.P
defines the local ids and names that remote ids and names
will be mapped into. \f2remote\f1 is either a remote id number
or remote name; \f2local\f1 is either a local id number or local name.
Placing a colon between a \f2remote\f1 and
a \f2local\f1 will give the value on the left
the permissions of the value on the right.
A single \f2remote\f1 name or id will assign
the user or group permissions of the same local
name or id.
\f4all\f1 is a predefined alias for the set of all user and group ids found
in the local \f4/etc/passwd\f1 and \f4/etc/group\f1 files.
(You cannot map by remote name in\p
.br
\f4global\f1 blocks.)
.P
Note: \f4idload\f1 will always output warning messages for \f4map all\f1,
since password files always contain multiple administrative
user names with the same id number.  The first mapping attempt on the
id number will succeed, each subsequent attempts will produce a warning.
.P
Remote File Sharing doesn't need to be running to use \f4idload\f1.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.P
On successful completion, \f4idload\f1 will produce one or more
translation tables and return a successful exit status.
If \f4idload\f1 fails, the command will return an exit
status of zero and not produce a translation table.
.SH ERRORS
.P
If (1) either rules file cannot be found or opened, (2) there are syntax errors in
the rules file, (3) there are semantic errors in the rules file,
(4) \f4host\f1 password or group information could not be found, or (5)
the command is not run with super-user privileges, an error message
will be sent to standard error.
Partial failures will cause a
warning message to appear, though the process will continue.

.SH NAME
\f4df\fP (ufs) \- report free disk space on \f4ufs\fP file systems
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4df\f1
[
\f4\-F ufs\f1

[
\f2generic_options\f1

[\f2directory\fP |\| \f2special\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I generic_options
are options supported by the generic \f4df\f1 command.
.PP
\f4df\f1
displays the amount of disk space occupied by
\f4ufs \f1
file systems, the amount of used and available space,
and how much of the file system's total capacity has been used.
.P
Note that the amount of space reported as
used and available
is less than the amount of space in the file system;
this is because the system
reserves a fraction of the space
in the file system to allow its file
system allocation routines to work well.
The amount reserved is typically about 10%;
this may be adjusted using
\f4tunefs\f1(1M).
When all the space on the file system except for this
reserve is in use, only the super-user can allocate new
files and data blocks to existing files.
When the file system is overallocated in this way,
\f4df\f1
may report that the file system is more than 100% utilized.
.P
The options are:
.PP
.TP
\f4\-F ufs\f1
Specifies the \f4ufs\f1-FSType.
.TP
\f4\-o\f1
Specify
\f4ufs\f1
file system specific options.
The available option is:
.RS
.TP
\f4i\f1
Report the number of used and free inodes.
May not be used with \f2generic_options\fP.
.RE
.SH NOTES
\f4df\fP calculates its results differently for mounted and unmounted
file systems.
For mounted systems the 10% reserved space mentioned above is
included in the number of kilobytes used.
For unmounted systems the 10% reservation is not included in
the number of kilobytes used.
.P
The \f4-b\fP and \f4-e\fP options override the \f4-t\fP option.

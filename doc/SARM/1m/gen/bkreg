.SH DESCRIPTION	
A backup register is a file containing descriptions of backup operations
to be performed on a \s-1UNIX\s+1 system.
The default backup register is located in
\f4/etc/bkup/bkreg.tab\f1.
Other backup registers may be created.
.P
The \f4bkreg\f1 command
may be executed only by a user with superuser privilege.
.P
Each entry
in a backup register describes backup operations to be performed
on a given disk object (called the originating object)
for some set of days and weeks during a rotation period.
There may be several register entries for an object,
but only one entry may specify backup operations for an object on
a specific day and week of the rotation period.
The entry describes the object,
the backup method to be used to archive the object,
and the destination volumes to be used to store the archive.
Each entry has a unique
\f2tag\f1 that identifies it.
\f2Tag\f1s must conform to file naming conventions.
.SS Rotation Period
Backups are performed in a rotation period specified in weeks.
When the end of a rotation period is reached,
a new period begins.
Rotation periods begin on Sundays.
The default rotation period is one week.
.SS Originating Objects
An originating object is either a raw data partition or a filesystem.
An originating object is described by its originating
object name, its device name, and optional volume
labels.
.P
Several backup operations for different originating objects
may be active concurrently by specifying priorities and
dependencies.
During a backup session,
higher priority backup operations 
are attempted before lower priority backup operations.
All backup operations of a given priority may proceed concurrently
unless dependencies are specified.
If one backup is declared to be dependent on others, it will not
be started until all of its antecedents have completed successfully.
.SS Destination Devices
Each backup archive is written to a set of storage volumes
inserted into a destination device.
A destination device can have destination device group, a
destination device name, media characteristics, and volume
labels.
Default characteristics for a medium (as specified in the
device table)
may be overridden (see the ``Device Management'' chapter in
the \f2System Administrator's Guide\fP).
.SS Backup Methods
An originating object is backed up to a destination
device archive using a method.
The method determines the amount of information backed up and the
representation of that information.
Different methods may be used for a given
originating object on different days of the rotation.
Each method accepts a set of options
that are specific to the method.
.P
Several default methods are provided with the Backup service.
Others methods may be added by a \s-1UNIX\s+1 system site.
For descriptions of the default methods, see
\f4incfile\f1(1M),
\f4ffile\f1(1M),
\f4fdisk\f1(1M),
\f4fimage\f1(1M),
and
\f4fdp\f1(1M).
.P
A backup archive may be migrated to a
different destination by specifying
\f4migration\f1
as the backup method.
The device name of the originating object for a migration
must have been the destination device for a previously
successful backup operation.
This form of backup does not re-archive the originating object.
It copies an archive from one destination to another,
updating the backup service's databases so that
restores can still be done automatically.
.SS Register Validations
There are items in a single backup register
entry and items across register entries
that must be consistent for the backup service to conduct a
backup session correctly.
Some of these consistencies are checked at the time the backup register
is created or changed.
Others can be checked only at the time the backup register is used
by
\f4backup\f1(1M).
See \f4backup\f1(1M) for a complete list of validations.
.PP
.SS Modes
The \f4bkreg\fP command has two modes:
changing the contents of a backup register and
displaying the contents of a backup register.
.SS Changing Contents
.TP .75i
\f4bkreg \-p\f1
changes the rotation period for a backup register.
The default rotation period is one week.
.TP
\f4bkreg \-a\f1
adds an entry to a backup register.
This option requires other options to be specified.
These are listed below under \f3Options\f1.
.TP
\f4bkreg \-e\f1
edits an existing entry in a backup register.
.TP
\f4bkreg \-r\f1
removes an existing entry from a backup register.
.SS Displaying Contents
.TP .75i
\f4bkreg \-C\f1
produces a customized display of the contents of a backup register.
.TP
\f4bkreg \f1[\f4\-A|\-R|\-O\f1]
produces a summary display of the contents of a backup register.
.SS Options
.TP
\f4\-a\f1
Adds a new entry to the default backup register.
Options required with \f4\-a\f1 are:  \f2tag, originating device, weeks:days,
destination device\f1, and \f2method\f1.
If other options are not specified, the following defaults are used:
the default backup register is used,
no method options are specified,
the priority is 0, and
no dependencies exist between entries.
.TP
\f4\-b\f2 moptions\f1
Each backup method supports a specific set of options that modify its
behavior.
.I moptions
is specified as a list of options
that are blank-separated and enclosed in quotes.
The argument string provided here is passed to
the method exactly as entered, without modification.
For lists of valid options,
see ``The Backup Service'' chapter in
the \f2System Administrator's Guide\f1
and the following entries in this book:
\f4fdisk\fP(1M),
\f4fdp\fP(1M),
\f4ffile\fP(1M),
\f4fimage\fP(1M),
and
\f4incfile\fP(1M).
.TP
\f4\-c\f2 weeks:days|\f4demand\f1
Sets the week(s) and day(s) of the rotation period during which a backup
entry should be performed or for which a display should be generated.
.br
.I weeks
is a set of numbers including 1 and 52.
The value of
.I weeks
cannot be greater than the value of
\f4\-p\f2period.\f1
.I weeks
is specified as a combination of lists or ranges
(either comma-separated or
blank-separated and enclosed in quotes).
An example set of weeks is
.sp .5
.in 1i
\f4``1 3-10,13''\fP
.in
.sp .5
indicating the first week, each of the third through
tenth weeks, and the thirteenth week of the rotation period.
.IP
.I days
is a set of numbers between 0 (Sunday) and 6 (Saturday).
In addition, \f2days\f1 are specified as 
a combination of lists or ranges 
(either comma-separated or
blank-separated and enclosed in quotes).
.IP
\f4demand\f1
indicates that an entry is used only when explicitly requested by
.sp .5
.in 1i
\f4backup \-c demand\f1
.in
.TP
\f4\-d\f2 ddev\f1
Specifies
.I ddev
as the destination device for the backup operation.
.I ddev
is of the form:
.sp .5
.in 1i
\f4[\f2dgroup\fP][:[\f2ddevice\fP][:\f2dchar\fP][:\f2dmname\fP]]\f1
.in
.sp .5
where either \f2dgroup\f1 or \f2ddevice\f1
must be specified and \f2dchar\f1 and \f2dmname\f1 are
optional.
(Both \f2dgroup\f1 and \f2ddev\f1 may be specified together.)
Colons delineate field boundaries and must be included
as indicated above.
.IP
.I dgroup
is the device group
for the destination device.
[See \f4devgroup.tab\f1(4).]
If omitted,
.I ddevice
must be specified.
.IP
.I ddevice
is the device name of a specific destination device.
[See \f4device.tab\f1(4).]
If omitted, \f2dgroup\f1 must be specified and any
available device in
.I dgroup
may be used.
.IP
.I dchar
describes media characteristics.
If specified, they override the
default characteristics for the device and group.
.I dchar
is of the form:
.sp .5
.in 1i
\f4keyword=\f2value\f1
.in
.sp .5
where \f4keyword\f1 is a valid device characteristic keyword
(as it appears in the device table.)
.I dchar
entries may be separated by commas or blanks.
If separated by blanks, the entire string of arguments to
.I ddev
must be enclosed in quotes.
.IP
.I dlabels
is a list of volume names
of the destination volumes.
The list of
.I dlabels
must be either comma-separated or blank-separated.
If blank-separated, the entire
.I ddev
argument must be surrounded by quotes.
Each
\f2dlabel\f1 corresponds to a \f2volumename\f1
specified on the \f4labelit\f1 command.
If
.I dlabels
is omitted, \f4backup\f1 and \f4restore\f1
do not validate the volume labels on this entry.
.TP
\f4\-e\f1
Edits an existing entry.
If any of the options
\f4\-b\f1,
\f4\-c\f1,
\f4\-d\f1,
\f4\-m\f1,
\f4\-o\f1,
\f4\-D\f1,
or
\f4\-P\f1
are present, they replace the current settings for the specified entry in the register.
.TP
\f4\-f \f2c\f1
Overrides the default output field separator.
\f2c\fP is the character that will
appear as the field separator on the display output.
The default output field separator is colon (\f4:\fP).
.TP
\f4\-h\f1
Suppresses headers when generating displays.
.TP
\f4\-m\f2 method|\f4migration\f1
Performs the backup using the specified
.I method.
Default methods are:
\f4incfile\f1,
\f4ffile\f1,
\f4fdisk\f1,
\f4fimage\f1,
and
\f4fdp\f1.
If the method to be used 
is not a default method, it
must appear as the executable file
in the standard method directory 
\f4/etc/bkup/method\f1.
\f4migration\f1
indicates that the
value of \f2orig\fP
(following the \f4-o\fP option)
matches the value of
.I ddev
during a prior backup operation.
The originating object is not rearchived;
it is simply copied to the
location specified by \f2ddev\fP
(following the \f4-d\fP option).
The backup history (if any) and tables of contents (if any)
are updated to reflect the changed destination for the original archive.
.TP
\f4\-o\f2 orig\f1
Specifies
.I orig
as the originating object for
the backup operation.
\f2orig\f1 is specified in the following format:
.sp .5
.in 1i
\f2oname\f4:\f2odevice\f4[:\f2omname\f4]\f1
.in
.sp .5
where
.I oname
is the name of an originating object.
For file system partitions, it is the nodename on which
the file system is usually mounted,
\f4mount\f1.
For data partitions, it is any valid path name.
This value is provided to the backup method
and validated by
\f4backup\f1.
The default data partition backup methods,
\f4fdp\f1 and \f4fdisk\f1,
do not validate this name.
.IP
.I odevice
is the device name for the originating object.
In all cases, it is a raw disk partition device name.
For AT&T 3B2 computers, this name is 
specified in the following format:
\f4/dev/rdsk/c?d?s?\f1.
.IP
.I olabel
is the volume label for the originating object.
For file system partitions, it corresponds to the
.I volumename
displayed by the \f4labelit\f1 command.
A data partition may have an associated volume name
that appears nowhere except on 
the outside of the volume (where it is taped);
\f4getvol\f1
may be used to have an operator validate the name.
.IP
On AT&T 3B2 computers, the special data partition
\f4/dev/rdsk/c?d?s6\f1
names an entire disk and is used
when disk formatting or repartitioning is
done to reference the disk's
volume table of contents (\s-1VTOC\s+1).
[See \f4fmthard\f1(1M) and \f4prtvtoc\f1(1M).]
\f4backup\f1
validates this special full disk partition
with the disk volume name specified when the disk was partitioned.
[See \f4fmthard\f1(1M).]
If the disk volume name is omitted,
\f4backup\f1
does not validate the volume labels for this originating object.
.TP
\f4\-p\f2 period\f1
Sets the rotation period (in weeks) for the backup register to
.IR period .
The minimum value is 1; the maximum value is 52.
By default the current week of the rotation is set to 1.
.TP
\f4\-r\f1
Removes the specified entries from the register.
.TP
\f4\-s\f1
Suppresses wrap-around behavior when generating displays.
Normal behavior is to wrap long values within each field.
.TP
\f4\-t\f2 table\f1
Uses \f2table\f1 instead of the default register,
\f4bkreg.tab\f1.
.TP
\f4\-v\f1
Generates displays using (vertical) columns
instead of (horizontal) rows.
This allows more information to be displayed
without encountering problems displaying long lines.
.TP
\f4\-w\f2 cweek\f1
Overrides the default behavior by
setting the current week of the rotation period to
.IR cweek .
.IR cweek
is an integer between 1 and the value of \f2period\f1.
The default is \f41\f1.
.TP
\f4\-A\f1
Displays a report describing all fields in the register.
The display produced by
this option is best suited as input to a filter,
since in horizontal mode it produces extremely long lines.
.TP
\f4\-C\f2 fields\f1
Generates a display of the contents of a backup register,
limiting the display to the specified fields.
The output is a set of lines, one per register entry.
Each line consists of the desired fields, separated by a field separator
character.
.I fields
is a
list of field names
(either comma-separated or
blank-separated and enclosed in quotes)
for the fields desired.
The valid field names are \f4period, cweek, tag, oname, odevice, olabel,
weeks, days, method, moptions, prio, depend, dgroup, ddevice, dchar,\f1
and \f4dlabel\f1.
.TP
\f4\-D\f2 depend\f1
Specifies a set of backup operations that must 
be completed successfully before
this operation may begin.
\f2depend\f1 is a list of \f2tag\f1(s)
(either comma-separated or
blank-separated and enclosed in quotes)
naming the antecedent backup operations.
.TP
\f4\-f\f2 c\f1
Overrides the default output field separator.
\f2c\f1 is the character
that will appear as the field separator on the display output.
The default output field separator is colon (":").
.TP
\f4\-O\f1
Displays a summary of all originating objects with entries in the register.
.TP
\f4\-P\f2 prio\f1
Sets a priority of
.IR prio
for this backup operation.
The default priority is 0; the highest priority is 100.
All backup operations with the same priority may run
simultaneously, unless the priority is 0.  All backups with
priority 0 run sequentially in an unspecified order.
.TP
\f4\-R\f1
Displays a summary of all destination devices with
entries in the register.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The exit codes for \f4bkreg\fP are the following:
.PP
\f40\f1 = the task completed successfully
.br
\f41\f1 = one or more parameters to \f4bkreg\fP are invalid
.br
\f42\f1 = an error has occurred, causing \f4bkreg\fP to fail to
      complete \f2all\f1 portions of its task

adds an entry named \f2acct5\f1 to the backup register named
\f4wklybu.tab\f1.
If \f4wklybu.tab\f1 does not already exist, it will be created.
The originating object to be backed up is the \f4/usr\f1
file system on the \f4/dev/rdsk/c1d0s2\f1 device which is known
as \f4usr\f1.
The backup will be
performed each Sunday, Tuesday, and Friday of the second,
fourth through sixth, eighth, and tenth weeks of the
rotation period using the \f4incfile\f1 (incremental
file) method.
The method options specify that
a table of contents will be created on additional media
instead of in the backup history log, the exception list
is to be ignored, and an estimate of the number of volumes for the
archive is to be provided before performing the backup.
The backup will be done to the next available diskette
device using the three diskette volumes \f4acctwkly1,
\f4acctwkly2,\f1 and \f4acctwkly3\f1.
These volumes have a capacity of 1404 blocks each.

.SH NAME
\f4fromsmtp\fP \- receive RFC822 mail from \s-1SMTP\s+1
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4fromsmtp\f1 [ \f4\-d\f1 ] [ \f4\-h\f2 host \f1] [ \f4\-s\f2 sender \f1]\f2 to ...\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4fromsmtp\fP reads an RFC822 message from its standard input, does some
conversion of the message to make it acceptable to
.SM UNIX
System
mail, and pipes the result to \f4rmail\fP.
The \f2to\fP arguments are passed as arguments to \f4rmail\fP.
\f4fromsmtp\fP is normally invoked by \f4smtpd\fP to deliver
incoming mail messages.
.P
The \f4\-d\fP option may be used for debugging \f4fromsmtp\fP.
It will cause the command line for \f4rmail\fP to be echoed to standard
output, as well as the results of the message (after conversion).
The message will not be given to \f4rmail\fP when this option is used.
.P
The \f4\-h\f2 host\f1 option may be used to prepend a host or network name to
the front of the sender path in the \f4From\fP line at the beginning of the
message.
This is useful if you need to identify which of several possible networks a
message was received from (for possible use in replying).
.P
The \f4\-s\f2 sender\f1 option is used to give a default sender name, in case
\f4fromsmtp\fP cannot determine the name of the sender from the message it
reads.
If this option is not used, the default sender name \f4unknown\fP will be
used.

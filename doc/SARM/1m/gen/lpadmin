.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4lpadmin\fP
configures the
\s-1LP\s0
print service 
by defining printers
and devices.
It is used to add and change printers, to remove printers
from the service,
to set or change the system default destination,
to define alerts for printer faults, and to mount print wheels.
.ig
and to define printers for remote printing services.
(See also \f2lpsystem\f1(1M).)
..
.SS "Adding or Changing a Printer"
The first form of the \f4lpadmin\fP command
(\f4lpadmin \-p\f2 printer \f2options\f1)
is used to configure a new printer
or to change the configuration of an existing printer.
The following
.I options
may appear in any order.
.TP 5
\f4\-A \ \f2alert-type\f1 [\f4\-W\f2 minutes\f1] 
The \f4\-A\f1 option
is used to define an alert to inform the administrator
when a printer fault is detected,
and periodically thereafter,
until the printer fault is cleared by the administrator.
The \f2alert-types\f1 are:
.RS 5
.TP 8
\f4mail\f1
Send the alert message via mail 
[see \f4mail\fP(1)] to the administrator.
.TP 8
\f4write\f1
Write the message to the terminal on which the
administrator is logged in.
If the administrator is logged in on several
terminals, one is chosen arbitrarily.
.TP 8
\f4quiet\f1
Do not send messages for the current condition.
An administrator can use this option to
temporarily stop receiving further messages about
a known problem.
Once the fault has been cleared and printing resumes,
messages will again be sent when another fault
occurs with the printer.
.TP 8
\f4none\f1
Do not send messages;
any existing alert definition for the printer will be removed.
No alert will be sent when the printer faults until
a different alert-type (except \f4quiet\f1) is used.
.TP
.I shell-command
Run the 
\f2shell-command\f1 each time the alert needs to
be sent.
The shell command should expect the message in
standard input.
If there are blanks embedded in the command,
enclose the command in quotes.
Note that the \f4mail\f1 and \f4write\f1 values for
this option are equivalent to the values
\f4mail\f1 \f2user-name\f1 and \f4write\f1 
\f2user-name\f1 respectively, where \f2user-name\f1
is the current name for the administrator.
This will be the login name of the person submitting
this command unless he or she has used the
\f4su\fP command to change to another user ID.
If the \f4su\fP command has been used to change the user ID,
then the \f2user-name\f1 for the new ID is used.
.TP
\f4list\f1
Display the type of the alert for the printer fault.
No change is made to the alert.
.PP
The message sent appears as follows:
.sp
.in +2m
\s-1\f4The printer \f2printer\fP has stopped printing for
the reason given below.
Fix the problem and bring the printer back on line.
Printing has stopped, but will be restarted
in a few minutes;
issue an enable command if you want to restart sooner.
\f4Unless someone issues a change request
.sp .5
.in +2m
lp \-i \f2request-id\fP \-P ...
.in -2m
.sp .5
to change the page list to print,
the current request will be reprinted from
the beginning.
.sp .5
The reason(s) it
stopped (multiple reasons indicate reprinted attempts):
.sp .5
.in +2m
\f2reason\f1
.in -2m
.in -2m
.fi
.PP
The
.SM LP
print service can detect printer faults only
through an adequate fast filter and only when
the standard interface program or a suitable customized
interface program is used.
Furthermore, the level of recovery after a fault
depends on the capabilities of the filter.
.PP
If the \f2printer\f1 is \f4all\f1, the alerting
defined in this command applies to all existing printers.
.PP
If the \f4\-W\f1 option
is not used to arrange
fault alerting for \f2printer\fP, the default procedure
is to mail one message to the administrator of
\f2printer\fP per fault.
This is equivalent to specifying
\f4\-W once\fP or \f4\-W 0\fP.
If \f2minutes\f1 is a number greater than zero,
an alert will be sent 
at intervals specified by \f2minutes\fP.
.RE
.TP
\f4\-c \f2class\f1
Insert \f2printer\fP into the specified \f2class\f1.
\f2Class\f1
will be created
if it does not already exist.
.TP 
\f4\-D \f2comment\f1
Save this \f2comment\f1 for display whenever a user asks for
a full description of \f2printer\fP
[see \f4lpstat\f1(1)].
The \s-1LP\s+1
print service does not interpret this comment.
.TP
\f4\-e \f2printer1\fP
Copy the
interface program of an existing \f2printer1\fP to be 
the interface program
for \f2printer\fP.
(Options \f4\-i\fP and \f4\-m\fP
may not be specified with this option.)
.TP 5
\f4\-F \f2fault-recovery\f1
This option specifies the recovery to be
used for any print request that is stopped because
of a printer fault,
according to the
value of \f2fault-recovery\f1:
.RS 5
.TP 8
\f4continue\f1
Continue printing on the top of the page where
printing stopped.
This requires a filter to wait for
the fault to clear
before automatically continuing.
.TP
\f4beginning\f1
Start printing the request again from the beginning.
.TP
\f4wait\f1
Disable printing on \f2printer\fP and wait for the
administrator or a user to enable printing again.
.IP
During the wait the administrator or the user who
submitted the stopped print request can issue a
change request that specifies where printing should
resume.
(See the \f4\-i\fP option of the \f4lp\fP command.)
If no change request is made before printing is
enabled, printing will resume at the top of the page
where stopped, if the filter allows; otherwise,
the request will be printed from the beginning.
.RE
.TP
\f4\-f allow:\f2form-list\f1
.sp -.5
.TP
\f4\-f deny:\f2form-list\f1
Allow or deny
the forms in \f2form-list\f1 to be printed on \f2printer\fP.
By default no forms are allowed on a new printer.
.IP
For each printer, the
.SM LP
print service keeps two lists of forms:  an
``allow-list'' of forms that may be used
with the printer, and a ``deny-list'' of forms that
may not be used with the printer.
With the \f4\-f allow\f1 option, the forms listed are
added to the allow-list and removed from the deny-list.
With the \f4\-f deny\f1 option, the forms listed are 
added to the deny-list and 
removed from the allow-list.
.IP
If the allow-list is not empty, 
only the forms in the list may be used on
the printer, 
regardless of the contents of the deny-list.
If the allow-list is empty, 
but the deny-list is not,
the forms in the deny-list 
may not be used with the printer. 
All forms can be excluded from a printer 
by specifying \f4\-f deny:all\fP.
All forms can be used on a printer
(provided the printer can handle 
all the characteristics of each form)
by specifying \f4\-f allow:all\fP.
.IP
The
.SM LP
print service uses this information as 
a set of guidelines for determining
where a form can be mounted.
Administrators, however, are not restricted from mounting a form
on any printer.
If mounting a form on a particular printer is in
disagreement with the information in the allow-list or deny-list,
the administrator is warned but the mount is accepted.
Nonetheless, if a user attempts to issue a print or change
request for a form and printer combination that is in
disagreement with the information, the request is accepted only if the
form is currently mounted on the printer.
If the form is later unmounted before the request can print,
the request is canceled and the user is notified by mail.
.IP
If the administrator tries to specify a form
as acceptable for use on a printer
that doesn't have the capabilities needed by the form,
the command is rejected.
.IP
Note the other use of \f4\-f\f1, with the \f4\-M\fP option, below.
.\" .TP
.\" \f4\-H\fP \f2strms_mod\fP	
.\" Pushes
.\" \s-1STREAMS\s+1 modules specified by the \f2strms_mod\fP argument 
.\" (one or more comma separated modules) 
.\" onto the stream before printing is begun.
.\" Valid only with the \f4\-v\fP option.
.TP
\f4\-h\f1
Indicate that
the device associated with the printer
is hardwired.
If neither of the mutually exclusive options,
\f4\-h\fP and \f4\-l\fP, is specified,
this option is assumed.
.TP
\f4\-I \f2content-type-list\f1
Allow \f2printer\fP to handle print requests 
with the content types listed in a
\f2content-type-list\f1.
If the list includes names of more than one type,
the names must be separated by commas or blank spaces.
(If they are separated by blank spaces,
the entire list must be enclosed in double quotes.)
.IP
The type \f4simple\f1 is recognized as 
the default content type for files in the 
.SM UNIX 
system.
A \f4simple\f1 type of file is
a data stream containing only printable 
.SM ASCII 
characters and the following control characters.
.sp .5
.TS
center;
c c c
l c l .
Control Character	Octal Value	Meaning
_
.sp .35
backspace	10\d\s-28\s0\u	move back one character, except
		\0\0\0\0\0at beginning of line
tab	11\d\s-28\s0\u	move to next tab stop
linefeed (newline)	12\d\s-28\s0\u	move to beginning of next line
form feed	14\d\s-28\s0\u	move to beginning of next page
carriage return	15\d\s-28\s0\u	move to beginning of current line
.TE
.sp
To prevent
the print service from considering \f4simple\f1
a valid type for the printer,
specify either an explicit value (such as the printer type)
in the \f2content-type-list\f1, or an empty list.
If you do want \f4simple\f1 included along
with other types,
you must include \f4simple\f1 in the \f2content-type-list\f1.
.IP
Except for \f4simple\f1, each \f2content-type\f1
name is freely determined by the administrator.
If the printer type is specified by the \f4\-T\fP
option, then the printer type is implicitly considered
to be also a valid content type.
.TP
\f4\-i \f2interface\f1
Establish a new interface program for
.IR printer .
.I Interface
is the pathname of the new program.
(The \f4\-e\fP and \f4\-m\fP options 
may not be specified with this option.)
.TP
\f4\-l\f1
Indicate that the device associated with
\f2printer\fP is a login terminal.
The \s-1LP\s+1 scheduler (\f4lpsched\fP)
disables all login terminals automatically
each time it is started.
(The \f4\-h\fP option 
may not be specified with this option.)
.TP
\f4\-M \-f \f2form-name\f1 [\f4\-a\f1 [\f4\-o filebreak\f1]]
Mount the form \f2form-name\f1 on \f2printer\fP.
Print requests that need the pre-printed
form \f2form-name\f1 will be printed on \f2printer\f1.
If more than one printer has the form mounted
and the user has specified \f4any\f1 (with the \f4\-d\f1
option of the \f4lp\f1 command) as the printer destination,
then
the print request will be printed on 
the one printer that also meets 
the other needs of the request.
.IP
The page length and width, and character and line
pitches needed by the form are compared with those
allowed for the printer, by checking the
capabilities in the \f4terminfo\fP database for
the type of printer.
If the form requires attributes that are not
available with the printer, the administrator is
warned but the mount is accepted.
If the form lists a print wheel as mandatory, but
the print wheel mounted on the printer is
different, the administrator is also warned but the
mount is accepted.
.IP
If the \f4\-a\f1 option is given,
an alignment pattern is printed,
preceded by the same initialization of the physical printer 
that precedes a normal print request, with one exception:  no banner
page is printed.
Printing is assumed to start at the top of the
first page of the form.
After the pattern is printed, the administrator can
adjust the mounted form in the printer and press
return for another alignment pattern (no
initialization this time), and can continue
printing as many alignment patterns as desired.
The administrator can quit the printing of alignment patterns 
by typing \f4q\f1.
.IP
If the \f4\-o filebreak\f1 option is given,
a formfeed is inserted between each copy of the alignment pattern.
By default, the alignment pattern is assumed to correctly fill a form,
so no formfeed is added.
.IP
A form is ``unmounted'' 
either by mounting a new form in its place 
or by using the \f4\-f none\f1 option.
By default, a new printer has no form mounted.
.IP
Note the other use of \f4\-f\f1 without the \f4\-M\fP option above. 
.TP
\f4\-M \-S \f2print-wheel\f1
Mount the \f2print-wheel\f1 on \f2printer\fP.
Print requests that need the \f2print-wheel\f1
will be printed on \f2printer\f1.
If more than one printer has \f2print-wheel\f1 mounted
and the user has specified \f4any\f1 
(with the \f4\-d\f1 option of the \f4lp\f1 command) 
as the printer destination,
then the print request will be printed 
on the one printer that also meets 
the other needs of the request.
.IP
If the \f2print-wheel\f1 is not listed 
as acceptable for the printer,
the administrator is warned but the mount is accepted.
If the printer does not take print wheels, the command is rejected.
.IP
A print wheel is ``unmounted'' 
either by mounting a new print wheel in its place 
or by using the option \f4\-S none\f1.
By default, a new printer has no print wheel mounted.
.IP
Note the other uses of the \f4\-S\f1 option without the \f4\-M\fP option described below.
.TP
\f4\-m \f2model\f1
Select \f2model\fP interface program,
provided with the
.SM LP
print service, for the printer.
(Options \f4\-e\fP and \f4\-i\fP
may not be specified
with this option.)
.TP
\f4\-o \f2printing-option\f1
Each \f4\-o\f1 option in the list below is
the default given to an interface program if
the option is not taken from a preprinted form description
or is not explicitly given by the user submitting a request
[see \f4lp\fP(1)].
The only \f4\-o\f1 options that can have defaults defined
are listed below.
.sp .5
.ta .75i
.nf
	\f4length\f1=\f2scaled-decimal-number\f1
	\f4width\f1=\f2scaled-decimal-number\f1
	\f4cpi\f1=\f2scaled-decimal-number\f1
	\f4lpi\f1=\f2scaled-decimal-number\f1
	\f4stty\f1=\f2'stty-option-list'\f1
.fi
.sp .5
The term ``scaled-decimal-number''
refers to a non-negative number
used to indicate a unit of size.
The type of unit is shown 
by a ``trailing'' letter attached to the number.
Three types of scaled decimal numbers
can be used with the \s-1LP\s+1 print service: numbers
that show sizes in centimeters
(marked with a trailing \f4c\fP);
numbers that show sizes in inches
(marked with a trailing \f4i\fP);
and numbers that show sizes in units appropriate to use
(without a trailing letter),
that is, lines, characters, lines per inch, or characters per inch.
.IP
The first four default option values must agree
with the capabilities of the type of physical printer,
as defined in the \f4terminfo\fP database for the
printer type.
If they do not, the command is rejected.
.IP
The \f2stty-option-list\f1 is not checked
for allowed values, but is passed directly to the
\f4stty\fP program by the standard interface program.
Any error messages produced by \f4stty\fP
when a request is processed
(by the standard interface program)
are mailed to the user submitting the request.
.IP
For each printing option not specified,
the defaults for the following attributes
are defined in the \f4terminfo\fP entry
for the specified printer type.
.sp .5
.ta .75i 1.1i
.nf
	\f4length\f1
	\f4width\f1

.TP
\f4\-o nobanner\f1
Allow a user to submit a print request
specifying that no banner page be printed.
.TP
\f4\-o banner\f1
Force a banner page to be printed with
every print request, even
when a user asks for no banner page.
This is the default; you must specify
\f4\-o nobanner\f1 if you want
to allow users to be able to specify 
\f4\-o nobanner\f1 with the \f4lp\f1 command.
.ig
.TP
\f4\-R\ \f2machine-list\f1
Sets up remote machines in \f2machine-list\f1
to share print services.
The
.SM LP
print service arranges for the advertising and mounting
of all necessary resources and for automatic
recovery of shared print services when the machine is brought to a
state where \s-1RFS\s+1 is run.
.IP
The 
.SM LP
Spooler keeps the parts of the print service owned by
each machine separate, so that the
administrator on one machine can change only the
service provided by his or her machine.
The
.SM LP
Spooler provides for no centrally managed print service
using RFS.
..
.TP
\f4\-r \f2class\f1
Remove \f2printer\fP
from the specified
.IR class .
If \f2printer\fP
is the last member of 
.IR class ,
then
.I class
will be removed.
.TP
\f4\-S \f2list\f1
Allow either the print wheels or aliases for character sets
named in \f2list\f1 to be used on the printer.
.IP
If the printer is a type that takes print wheels,
then \f2list\f1 is a comma or space separated list of print wheel names.
(Enclose the list with quotes if it contains blanks.)
These will be the only print wheels
considered mountable on the printer.
(You can always force a different print wheel to be mounted,
however.)
Until the option is used to specify a list,
no print wheels will be considered mountable on the printer,
and print requests
that ask for a particular print wheel
with this printer will be rejected.
.IP
If the printer is a type that has selectable character sets,
then \f2list\f1 is a comma or blank separated list
of character set name ``mappings'' or aliases.
(Enclose the list with quotes if it contains blanks.)
Each ``mapping'' is of the form
.sp .5
\f2known-name=alias\f1
.sp .5
The \f2known-name\f1 is a character set number preceded by \f4cs\f1
(such as \f4cs3\f1 for character set three)
or a character set name from the \f4Terminfo\fP database entry \f4csnm\f1.
[See \f4terminfo\fP(4) in the \f2Programmer's Reference Manual\f1.]
If this option is not used to specify a list,
only the names already known from the Terminfo database 
or numbers with a prefix of \f4cs\f1
will be acceptable for the printer.
.sp
If \f2list\f1 is the word \f4none\f1,
any existing print wheel lists
or character set aliases will be removed.
.IP
Note the other uses of the \f4\-S\f1 with the \f4\-M\fP option described above.
.TP
\f4\-s \f2system-name\f4\f1[!\f2printer-name\f1]
Make a remote printer 
(one that must be accessed through another system)
accessible to users on your system.
\f2System-name\f1 is the name of the remote system
on which the remote printer is located;
it must be listed in the systems table
(\f4/etc/lp/Systems\f1).
\f2Printer-name\f1 is the name used on the remote system
for that printer.
For example,
if you want to access 
\f2printer1\fP on \f2system1\fP
and you want it called 
\f2printer2\fP
on your system,
enter \f4\-p \f2printer2\fP

\f4\-T\fP \f2printer-type-list\fP
Identify the printer 
as being of one or more \f2printer-type\fPs.
Each \f2printer-type\f1 is used to extract data
from the \f4terminfo\fP database;
this information is used to initialize the printer before
printing each user's request.
Some filters may also use a \f2printer-type\f1
to convert content for the printer.
If this option is not used,
the default \f2printer-type\f1
will be \f4unknown\f1;
no information
will be extracted from \f4terminfo\fP
so each user request will be printed without
first initializing the printer.
Also, this option 
must be used if the

(The list is comma or space separated;
enclose the list in quotes if it is space separated.)
The \f2printer-type\f1 is used to extract data
from the \f4terminfo\fP database;
this information is used to initialize the printer before
printing each user's request.

With the \f4\-u allow\f1 option,
the users listed
are added to the allow-list and removed from the deny-list.

.IP
If the allow-list is not empty, 
only the users in the list may use
the printer, 
regardless of the contents of the deny-list.
If the allow-list is empty, 
but the deny-list is not,
the users in the deny-list 
may not use the printer. 
All users can be denied access to the printer 
by specifying \f4\-u deny:all\fP.
All users may use the printer
by specifying \f4\-u allow:all\fP.
.TP
\f4\-U \f2dial-info\f1
The \f4\-U\f1 option
allows your print service to access a remote printer.
(It does not enable your print service
to access a remote printer service.)
Specifically, \f4\-U\f1
assigns the ``dialing'' information \f2dial-info\f1 to the printer.
\f2Dial-info\f1 is used with the \f4dial\fP
routine to call the printer.
Any network connection supported by the Basic
Networking Utilities will work.
\f2Dial-info\f1 can be either a phone number for a modem
connection, or a system name for other
kinds of connections.
Or, if \f4\-U\f1 \f4direct\f1 is given, no dialing will take place,
because the name \f4direct\f1 is reserved for a printer that is
directly connected.
If a system name is given, it is used to
search for connection details from the file
\f4/etc/uucp/Systems\f1 or related files.
The Basic Networking Utilities are required to support
this option.
By default, \f4\-U direct\f1 is assumed.
.TP
\f4\-v \f2device\f1
Associate a
.I device
with \f2printer\fP.
.I Device
is the path name of a file
that is writable by
\f4lp\fP.
Note that
the same
.I device
can be associated
with more than one printer.
.SS "Restrictions"
When creating a new printer,
one of three options (\f4\-v\fP, \f4\-U\fP, 
or \f4\-s\fP\) must be supplied.
In addition,
only one of the following may be supplied: \f4\-e\f1,
\f4\-i\f1,
or
\f4\-m\f1;
if none of these three options is supplied,
the model standard is used.
The
\f4\-h\f1
and
\f4\-l\f1
options
are mutually exclusive.
Printer and class names
may be no longer than 14 characters
and must consist entirely of the characters
\f4A\f1-\f4Z\f1,
\f4a\f1-\f4z\f1,
\f40\f1-\f49\f1
and
\f4_\f1
(underscore).
If \f4\-s\fP is specified,
the following options are invalid: \f4\-A\fP,
\f4\-e\fP, \f4\-F\fP, \f4\-h\fP, \f4\-i\fP,
\f4\-l\fP,
\f4\-M\fP,
\f4\-m\fP,
\f4\-o\fP,
\f4\-U\fP,
\f4\-v\fP, and
\f4\-W\fP.
.SS "Removing a Printer Destination"
The \f4\-x \f2dest\f1 option
removes the destination
.I dest
(a printer or a class), from the
.SM LP
print service.
If
.I dest
is a printer
and is the only member of a class,
then the class will be deleted, too.
If \f2dest\f1 is \f4all\f1,
all printers and classes are removed.
No other \f2options\f1
are allowed with
\f4\-x\f1.
.SS "Setting/Changing the System Default Destination"
The \f4\-d \f1[\f2dest\f1] option
makes
.IR dest ,
an existing printer or class,
the new system default destination.
If
.I dest
is not supplied,
then there is no system default destination.
No other \f2options\f1
are allowed with
\f4\-d\f1.
.SS "Setting an Alert for a Print Wheel"
.TP 5
\f4\-S \f2print-wheel \f4\-A \ \f2alert-type \f1[\f4\-W \f2minutes\f1] [\f4\-Q \f2requests\f1]
The \f4\-S \f2print-wheel\f1 option
is used with the
\f4\-A \f2alert-type\f1 option
to define an alert
to mount the print wheel when
there are jobs queued for it.
If this command is not used to arrange
alerting for a print wheel, no alert will be sent for 
the print wheel.
Note the other use of \f4\-A\fP, with the \f4\-p\fP option, above.
.IP
The \f2alert-types\f1 are:
.RS 5
.TP 8
\f4mail\f1
Send the alert message via the \f4mail\fP command
to the administrator.
.TP 8
\f4write\f1
Write the message,
via the \f4write\fP command,
to the terminal on which the
administrator is logged in.
If the administrator is logged in on several
terminals, one is arbitrarily chosen. 
.TP 8
\f4quiet\f1
Do not send messages for the current condition.
An administrator can use this option to
temporarily stop receiving further messages about
a known problem.
Once the \f2print-wheel\f1 has been mounted
and subsequently unmounted,
messages will again be sent when the number of print requests
reaches the threshold specified by the \f4\-Q\fP option.
.TP 8
\f4none\f1
Do not send messages until the \f4\-A\f1 option
is given again with a different \f2alert-type\f1
(other than \f4quiet\f1).
.TP
.I shell-command
Run the \f2shell-command\f1 each time the alert needs to
be sent.
The shell command should expect the message in
standard input.
If there are blanks embedded in the command,
enclose the command in quotes.
Note that the \f4mail\f1 and \f4write\f1 values for
this option are equivalent to the values
\f4mail\f1 \f2user-name\f1 and \f4write\f1 
\f2user-name\f1 respectively, where \f2user-name\f1
is the current name for the administrator.
This will be the login name of the person submitting this command
unless he or she has used the \f4su\fP command
to change to another user ID.
If the \f4su\fP command has been used to change the user ID,
then the \f2user-name\f1 for the new ID is used.
.TP
\f4list\f1
Display the type of the alert for the print wheel
on standard output.
No change is made to the alert.
.PP
The message sent appears as follows:
.sp
.nf
.RS 3
\f4The print wheel \f2print-wheel\fP needs to be mounted 
on the printer(s):
\f2printer\fP (\f2integer1 \f4requests)
\f2integer2 \f4print requests await this print wheel.\f1
.fi
.RE
.PP
The printers listed are those that the administrator had
earlier specified were candidates for this print wheel.
The number 
\f2integer\d\s-21\s0\u\f1 listed next to each printer
is the number of requests eligible for the printer.
The number \f2integer\d\s-22\s0\u\f1 shown after
the printer list is the total number of requests awaiting the
print wheel.
It will be less than the sum of the other numbers if some requests
can be handled by more than one printer.
.P
If the \f2print-wheel\f1 is \f4all\f1, the alerting
defined in this command applies to all print wheels
already defined to have an alert.
.ig
.P
Only one administrator per print wheel can be alerted.
If this command is run by more than one
administrator for the same print wheel,
the last command run applies.
..
.P
If the \f4\-W\fP option is not given,
the default procedure is that
only one message will be sent per need to mount the print wheel.
Not specifying the \f4\-W\f1 option 
is equivalent to specifying
\f4\-W once\fP or \f4\-W 0\fP.
If \f2minutes\fP is a number greater than zero,
an alert will be sent at intervals
specified by \f2minutes\fP.
.P
If the \f4\-Q\f1 option is also given,
the alert will be sent when 
a certain number
(specified by the argument \f2requests\fP)
of print requests that need the print wheel are waiting.
If the \f4\-Q\f1 option is not given, or
\f2requests\fP
is 1 or the word \f4any\f1
(which are both the default),
a message is sent as soon as 
anyone submits a print request
for the print wheel when it is not mounted.

.SH "\f4Defining Remote Printers for Remote Printing Services\f1"
The fourth form of the \f4lpadmin\fP command
is used to define the remote printer,
\f2printer-name\d\s-22\s0\u\f1, and its machine,
\f2machine-name\f1,
that will handle remote print requests from the
local machine. The remote printer will be be
referred to as \f2printer-name\d\s-21\s0\u\f1 
on the local machine.
In order to establish a file transfer mechanism for
remote print services, the \f2lpnetwork\f1(1M)

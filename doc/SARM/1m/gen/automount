.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\f4automount\f1
is a daemon that automatically and transparently mounts an
NFS
file system as needed. 
It monitors attempts to access
directories that are associated with an
\f4automount\f1
map,
along with any directories or files that reside under them.
When a file is to be accessed,
the daemon mounts the appropriate
NFS file system.
You can assign a map to a directory using an entry in a direct\p
.br
\f4automount\f1
map,
or by specifying an indirect map on the command line.
The \f4automount\f1 daemon resides in \f4/usr/lib/nfs\f1 directory.
.LP
\f4automount\f1
uses a map to locate an appropriate
NFS file server,
exported file system, and mount options.
It then mounts the file system in a temporary location,
and replaces the file system entry for the directory
or subdirectory with a symbolic link
to the temporary location.
If the file system is not accessed within
an appropriate interval (five minutes by default),
the daemon unmounts
the file system and removes the symbolic link.
If the indicated directory has not already been created,
the daemon creates it,
and then removes it upon exiting.
.LP
Since the name-to-location binding is dynamic,
updates to an
\f4automount\f1
map are transparent to the user.
This obviates the need to \(lqpre-mount\(rq shared file
systems for applications that have \(lqhard coded\(rq
references to files.
.LP
If you specify the dummy directory
\f1/\-\f4,\f1
\f4automount\f1
treats the
.I map
argument that follows as the name of a direct map.
In a direct map,
each entry associates the full pathname of a mount
point with a remote file system to mount.
.LP
If the
\f4directory\fP
argument is a pathname, the
.I map
argument points to a file called an indirect map.
An indirect map
contains a list of the subdirectories contained
within the indicated
\f4directory\fP.
With an indirect map,
it is these subdirectories that are mounted automatically.
The
.I map
argument must be a full pathname.
.LP
The
\f4\-\f2mount-options\f1
argument,
when supplied,
is a comma-separated list of
\f4mount\f1(1M)
options,
preceded by a hyphen (\-).
If mount options are specified in the indicated map,
however,
those in the map take precedence.
.PP
Only a privileged user can execute this command.
.LP
The following options are available:
.TP
\f4\-m\f1
Disable the search of the Network Interface Services map file.
(See ``The NIS'' chapter of the \f2Programmer's Guide:
Networking Interfaces\f1.)
This option can only be used in conjunction with the \f4\-f\f1 option.
.TP
\f4\-n\f1
Disable dynamic mounts.
With this option,
references through the\p
.br
\f4automount\f1
daemon only succeed when the target file system has been
previously mounted.
This can be used to prevent
NFS
servers from cross-mounting each other.
.TP
\f4\-T\f1
Trace.
Expand each
NFS
call and display it on the standard output.
.TP
\f4\-v\f1
Verbose.
Log status messages to the console.
.TP
\f4\-D\f2 name\f4=\f2value\f1
Assign
.I value
to the indicated
\f4automount\f1
(environment) variable.
.TP
\f4\-f\f2 master-file\f1
Specify all arguments in \f2master-file\f1 and
instruct the daemon to look in
it for instructions.
.TP
\f4\-M\f2 mount-directory\f1
Mount temporary file systems in the named directory,
instead of
\f4/tmp_mnt\f1.
.TP
\f4\-t\f2 sub-options\f1
Specify 
.I sub-options 
as a comma-separated list that
contains any combination of the following:
.RS
.TP
\f4l \f2duration\f1
Specify a
.IR duration ,
in seconds,
that a file system is to remain mounted when not in use.
The default is 5 minutes.
.TP
\f4m \f2interval\f1
Specify an
.IR interval ,
in seconds,
between attempts
to mount a file system.
The default is 30 seconds.
.br
.ne 5
.TP
\f4w \f2interval\f1
Specify an
.IR interval ,
in seconds,
between attempts to unmount
file systems that have exceeded their cached times.
The default is 1 minute.
.RE
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.LP
Environment variables can be used within an
\f4automount\f1
map.
For instance,
if
\f4$\s-1HOME\s0\f1
appeared within a map,
\f4automount\f1
would expand it to its current value for the
\f4\s-1HOME\s0\f1
variable.
.LP
If a reference needs to be protected from affixed characters,
enclose the variable name within braces.
.SH USAGE
.SS Direct/Indirect Map Entry Format
.LP
A simple map entry (mapping) takes the form:
.IP
\f4directory\fP
[
\f4\-\f2mount-options\f1
]
.I location\ .\|.\|.
.LP
where
\f4directory\fP
is the full pathname of the directory to mount
when used in a direct map, 
or the basename of a subdirectory in an indirect map.
.I mount-options
is a comma-separated list of
\f4mount\f1
options, and
.I location
specifies a remote file system from which the
directory may be mounted.
In the simple case,
.I location
takes the form:
.IP
\f2host\f4:\f2pathname\f1
.LP
Multiple
.I location
fields can be specified, in which case
\f4automount\f1
sends multiple
\f4mount\f1
requests;
\f4automount\f1
mounts the file system from the first host that replies to the
\f4mount\f1
request.
This request is first made to the local net or subnet.
If there is no response,
any connected server may respond.
.LP
If
.I location
is specified in the form:
.IP
\f2host\f4:\f2path\f4:\f2subdir\f1
.LP
.I host
is the name of the host from which to mount the file system,
.I path
is the pathname of the directory to mount,
and
.IR subdir ,
when supplied,
is the name of a\p
.br
subdirectory to which the
symbolic link is made.
This can be used to prevent duplicate
mounts when multiple directories in the same remote
file system may be accessed.
With a map for
\f4/home\f1
such as:
.LP
.RS
\f4able	homebody:/home/homebody:able\f1
.br
\f4baker	homebody:/home/homebody:baker\f1
.RE
.LP
and a user attempting to access a file in
\f4/home/able\f1,
\f4automount\f1
mounts
\f4homebody:/home/homebody\f1,
but creates a symbolic link called
\f4/home/able\f1
to the
\f4able\f1
subdirectory in the temporarily mounted file system.
If a user immediately tries to access a file in
\f4/home/baker\f1,
\f4automount\f1
needs only to create a symbolic link that points to the
\f4baker\f1
subdirectory;
\f4/home/homebody\f1
is already mounted.
With the following map:
.LP
.RS
\f4able	homebody:/home/homebody/able\f1
.br
\f4baker	homebody:/home/homebody/baker\f1
.RE
.LP
\f4automount\f1
would have to mount the file system twice.
.LP
A mapping can be continued across input lines by escaping the
NEWLINE
with a backslash.
Comments begin with a
\f4 #\f1
and end at the subsequent
NEWLINE.

.ne 7
.SS "\f2Directory Pattern Matching\fP"
.LP
The
\f1&
character is expanded to the value of the
\f4directory\fP
field for the entry in which it occurs.
In this case:
.LP
.IP
\f4able	homebody:/home/homebody:&\f1
.LP
the
\f4&\f1
expands to
\f4able\f1.
.LP
The
\f1*
character, when supplied as the
\f4directory\fP
field,
is recognized as the catch-all entry.
Such an entry resolves to any entry not previously matched.
For instance,
if the following entry appeared in the indirect map for
\f4/home\f1:
.IP
\f4*	&:/home/&\f1
.LP
this would allow automatic mounts in
\f4/home\f1
of any remote file system whose location could be specified as:
.IP
\f2hostname\f4:/home/\f2hostname\f1
.br
.ne 6
.SS "\f2Hierarchical Mappings\fP"
.LP
A hierarchical mapping takes the form:
.SP
.RS
\f4directory\fP
\f1[\f4\|/\f1\|[\f2subdirectory\fP]\|]
.RI [ \-mount-options ]
.IR location .\|.\|.
.if t .ti +.5i
\f1[\f4\|/\f1\|[\f2subdirectory\fP]
.RI [ \-mount-options ]
.IR location .\|.\|.\|]\|.\|.\|.
.RE
.LP
The initial
\f4/\f1[\f2subdirectory\|\f1]
is optional for the first location list
and mandatory for all subsequent lists.
The optional
.I subdirectory
is taken as a filename relative to the
\f4directory\fP.
If
.I subdirectory
is omitted in the first occurrence, the
\f4/\f1
refers to the directory itself.
.LP
Given the direct map entry:
.LP
.nf
\f4/arch/src\ \ \ \e
/         \-ro,intr  arch:/arch/src          alt:/arch/src\ \ \ \e
/1.0      \-ro,intr  alt:/arch/src/1.0       arch:/arch/src/1.0\ \ \ \e
/1.0/man  \-ro,intr  arch:/arch/src/1.0/man  alt:/arch/src/1.0/man\f1
.fi
.LP
\f4automount\f1
would automatically mount
\f4/arch/src\f1,
\f4/arch/src/1.0\f1
and
\f4/arch/src/1.0/man\f1,
as needed, from either
\f4arch\f1
or
\f4alt\f1,
whichever host responded first.
.SS Direct Maps
.LP
A direct map contains mappings for any number of directories.
Each directory listed in the map is automatically mounted as
needed.
The direct map as a whole is not associated with any
single directory.
.SS Indirect Maps
.LP
An indirect map allows you to specify mappings for the
subdirectories you wish to mount under the
\f4directory\fP
indicated on the command line.
It also obscures local subdirectories for
which no mapping is specified. 
In an indirect map, each
\f4directory\fP
field consists of the basename of a subdirectory to
be mounted as needed.
.SS "Included Maps"
.LP
The contents of another map can be included within a map
with an entry of the form
.IP
\f4+\f2mapname\f1
.LP
where
.I mapname
is a filename.
.SS Special Maps
.LP
The
\f4\-null\f1
map is the only special map currently available.
The
\f4\-null\f1
map, when indicated on the command line,
cancels a previous map for the directory indicated.
.SH FILES
.PD 0
.TP 20
\f4/tmp_mnt\f1
parent directory for dynamically mounted file systems
.PD
.SH "SEE ALSO"
\f4df\f1(1M),
\f4mount\f1(1M),
\f4passwd\f1(4)
.SH NOTES
.LP
Mount points used by \f4automount\fP are not recorded in \f4/etc/mnttab\fP.
\f4mount\fP(1M) on such mount points will fail, saying mount point busy,
although the mount point is not in \f4/etc/mnttab\fP.
.LP
Shell filename expansion does not apply to objects
not currently mounted.
.LP
Since
\f4automount\f1
is single-threaded, any request that is delayed by a slow or
non-responding NFS
server will delay all subsequent automatic mount requests until it completes.

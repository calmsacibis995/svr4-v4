.SH NAME
\f4dname\f1 \- print Remote File Sharing domain and network names
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4dname\f1
[\-D \f2domain\f1] [\-N \f2netspeclist\f1] [\-dna]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\f4dname\f1 prints or defines a host's Remote File Sharing domain name
or the network(s) used by Remote File Sharing as transport provider(s).
When used with \f4d\f1, \f4n\f1, or \f4a\f1 options,
\f4dname\f1 can be run by any user to
print the domain name, transport provider name(s), or both.
Only a user with root permission can
use the \f4\-D \f2domain\f1 option to set the domain name for the host
or \f4\-N \f2netspeclist\f1 to set the network specification used
for Remote File Sharing.  \f2netspeclist\f1 is a comma-separated
list of transport providers (\f2tp1,tp2,...\f1).  The value of each
transport provider is the network device name, relative to the
\f2/dev\f1 directory.  For example, the STARLAN NETWORK uses
\f4starlan\f1.
.P
\f2domain\f1 must consist of no more than 14 characters, 
consisting of any combination of letters (upper and lower case),
digits, hyphens (\-), and underscores (_).
.P
When \f4dname\f1 is used to change a domain name, the host's
password is removed.  The administrator will be prompted for a new
password the next time Remote File Sharing is started [\f4rfstart\f1(1M)].
.P
If \f4dname\f1 is used with no options, it will default to \f4dname \-d\f1.
.SH NOTES
You cannot use the \f4\-N\f1 or \f4\-D\f1 options while Remote
File Sharing is running.

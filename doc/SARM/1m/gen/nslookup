.SH NAME
\f4nslookup\f1 \- query name servers interactively
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4nslookup\f1
[
\f4\-l\f1
] [
.I address
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4nslookup\f1
is an interactive program to query
.SM ARPA
Internet domain name servers.
The user can contact servers to
request information about a specific host or print
a list of hosts in the domain.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 9
\f4\-l\f1
Use the local host's name server instead of the servers in
\f4/etc/resolve.conf\f1.
(If
\f4/etc/resolve.conf\f1
does not exist or does not contain server information, the
\f4\-l\f1
option does not have any effect).
.TP 9
.I address
Use the name server on the host machine
with the given Internet address.
.SH USAGE
.SS Overview
The Internet domain name-space is tree-structured, with four
top-level domains at present:
.RS
.TP
.SM COM
commercial establishments
.TP
.SM EDU
educational institutions
.TP
.SM GOV
government agencies
.TP
.SM MIL
\s-1MILNET\s0 hosts
.RE
.LP
If you are looking for a specific host,
you need to know something about the host's organization
in order to determine the top-level domain it belongs to.
For instance, if you want to find the Internet address of a machine at
.SM UCLA ,
do the following:
.RS 3
.TP 4
\(bu
Connect with the root server using the
\f4root\f1
command.
The root server of the name space has knowledge of the top-level
domains.
.TP
\(bu
Since
.SM UCLA
is a university, its domain name is
\f4ucla.edu\f1.
Connect with a server for the
\f4ucla.edu\f1
domain with the command
\f4server ucla.edu\f1.
The response will print
the names of hosts that act as servers for that domain.
Note: the root server does not have information about
\f4ucla.edu\f1,
but knows the names and addresses of hosts that do.
Once located by the root server,
all future queries will be sent to the
.SM UCLA
name server.
.TP
\(bu
To request information about a particular host in the domain
(for instance,
\f4locus\f1),
just type the host name.
To request a listing of hosts in the
.SM UCLA
domain, use the
\f4ls\f1
command.
The
\f4ls\f1
command requires a domain name (in this case,
\f4ucla.edu\f1)
as an argument.
.RE
.LP
If you are connected with a name server that handles
more than one domain, all lookups for
host names must be fully specified with its domain.
For instance, the domain
\f4harvard.edu\f1
is served by
\f4seismo.css.gov\f1, 
which also services the\p
.br
.ne 1i
\f4css.gov\f1
and
\f4cornell.edu\f1
domains.
A lookup request for the host
\f4aiken\f1 in the
\f4harvard.edu\f1
domain must be specified as
\f4aiken.harvard.edu\f1.
However, the\p
.IP
\f4set domain\|=\|\f2name\f1
.LP
and
.IP
\f4set defname\f1
.LP
commands can be used to automatically
append a domain name to each request.
.LP
After a successful lookup of a host, use the
\f4finger\f1
command to
see who is on the system, or to finger a specific person.
To get other information about the host, use the
.IP
\f4set querytype\|=\|\f2value\f1
.LP
command to change the type of information desired and request another
lookup.
(\f4finger\f1
requires the type to be A.)
.SS Commands
To exit, type
.SM Ctrl-D
(EOF).
The command line length must be less than 80 characters.
An unrecognized command will be interpreted as a host name.
.TP
\fIhost\fP [\fIserver\fP]
Look up information for
.I host
using the current default server or using
.I server
if it is specified.
.
.ne 5
.TP
\f4server \f2domain\f1
.ns
.TP
\f4lserver \f2domain\f1
Change the default server to
.IR domain .
\f4lserver\f1
uses the initial server to look up
information about
.I domain
while
\f4server\f1
uses the current default server.
If an authoritative answer can't be found, the names of servers
that might have the answer are returned.
.
.TP
\f4root\f1
Changes the default server to the server
for the root of the domain name space.
Currently, the host
\f4sri-nic.arpa\f1
is used; this command is a synonym for
\f4lserver sri-nic.arpa\f1.)
The name of the root server can be changed with the
\f4set root\f1
command.
.
.TP
\f4finger\f1 [ \f2name\f1 ]
Connect with the finger server on the current host, which
is defined by a previous successful lookup for a host's
address information (see the
\f4set \f2querytype\fP =\|A\f1
command).
As with the shell, output can be redirected to a named file
using
\f4>\f1
and
\f4>>\f1.
.
.TP \fIdomain\fR
\f4ls \fR[\f4\-ah\fR]
List the information available for
.IR domain .
The default output contains host names
and their Internet addresses.
The \f4\-a\f1
option lists aliases of hosts in the domain.
The \f4\-h\f1 option lists
.SM CPU
and operating system information for the domain.
As with the shell, output can be redirected to a named file
using
\f4>\f1
and
\f4>>\f1.
When output is directed to a file, hash marks are printed for every
50 records received from the server.
.TP
\f4view \f2filename\f1
Sort and list the output of the
\f4ls\f1
command with
\f4more\f1(1).

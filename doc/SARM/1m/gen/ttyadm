.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4ttyadm\f1 command is an administrative command that formats
\f4ttymon\f1-specific information and writes it to the standard
output.
The Service Access Facility (SAF) requires
each port monitor to provide such a
command.
Note that the port monitor administrative file is updated by the Service Access
Controller's administrative commands,
\f4sacadm\fP and \f4pmadm\fP.
\f4ttyadm\fP provides a means of presenting formatted
port monitor-specific (i.e., \f4ttymon\f1-specific) data to these commands.
.P
.sp .5
.TP 14
\f4\-b\fP
Sets the ``bidirectional port'' flag.
When this flag is set, the line can be used in both directions.
\f4ttymon\fP will allow users to connect to the service associated with the
port, but if the port is free, \f4uucico\fP, \f4cu\fP, or \f4ct\fP
can use it for dialing out.
.TP
\f4\-c\fP
Sets the connect-on-carrier flag for the port.
If the \f4\-c\fP flag is set, \f4ttymon\fP will invoke the port's associated
service immediately when a connect indication is received (i.e., no
prompt is printed and no baud-rate searching is done).
.TP
\f4\-d\fP \f2device\fP
\f2device\f1 is the full pathname of the device file for the TTY port.
.TP
\f4\-h\fP
Sets the hangup flag for the port.
If the \f4\-h\fP flag is not set, \f4ttymon\fP will force a hangup on the
line by setting the speed to zero before setting the speed to the default
or specified value.
.TP
\f4\-i\fP \f2message\fP
Specifies the inactive (disabled) response message.
This message will be sent to the TTY port if the port is disabled or the
\f4ttymon\fP monitoring the port is disabled.
.TP
\f4\-l\fP \f2ttylabel\fP
Specifies which \f2ttylabel\fP in the \f4/etc/ttydefs\fP file to use
as the starting point when searching for the proper baud rate.
.TP
\f4\-m\fP \f2modules\fP
Specifies a list of pushable \s-1STREAMS\s+1 modules.
The modules will be pushed, in the order in which they are specified, before the
service is invoked.
\f2modules\fP must be a comma-separated list of modules, with no white
space included.
Any modules currently on the stream will be popped before these 
modules are pushed.
.TP
\f4\-r \f2count\fP
.\"The \f4\-r\f1 option is valid only when used in conjunction with the
.\"\f4\-b\f1 option.
When the \f4\-r\f1 option is invoked, \f4ttymon\f1 will wait until it receives
data from the port before it displays a prompt.
If \f2count\fP is equal to zero, \f4ttymon\fP will wait until it
receives any character.
If \f2count\fP is greater than zero, \f4ttymon\fP will wait until
\f2count\fP newlines have been received.
.TP
\f4\-p\fP \f2prompt\fP
Specifies the prompt message, e.g., ``\f4login:\fP.''
.\"If this option is not given, then \f4ttyadm\fP uses the default value
.\"``\f4login:\fP''for \f2prompt\fP.
.\".sp .5
.\"\f4ttyadm\fP also allows the explicit specification of a null
.\"prompt.
.\"To specify a null prompt,
.\"the \f4\-p\fP option is given with a null-string argument (e.g., \f4''\fP).
.TP
\f4\-s\fP \f2service\fP
\f2service\f1 is
the full pathname of the service to be invoked when a connection request
is received.
If arguments are required, the command and its arguments must
be enclosed in double quotes.
.TP
\f4\-t\fP \f2timeout\fP
Specifies that \f4ttymon\fP should close a port if the open on
the port succeeds and no input data is received in 
\f2timeout\fP seconds.
.TP
\f4\-V\fP
Displays the version number of the current \f4/usr/lib/saf/ttymon\fP command. 
.SH OUTPUT
If successful, \f4ttyadm\f1 will generate the requested information,
write it on
the standard output, and exit with a status of \f40\f1.
If \f4ttyadm\f1 is invoked with an
invalid number of arguments or invalid arguments,
.\"or the \f4\-r\fP option is specified without the \f4\-b\fP option,
or if an incomplete option is specified, an error message will be
written to the standard error and \f4ttymon\fP will exit
with a non-zero status.
.\".SH EXAMPLES
.\"The first example shows how \f4ttyadm\fP can be used to
.\"add a TTY port to the system.
.\"\f4/dev/term/tty11\fP is the TTY port to be added.
.\"It invokes \f4login\fP as its service
.\"when a connection request is made.
.\"It is monitored by the \f4ttymon\fP invocation used for
.\"dialup lines (\f(CWDIALUP\fP).
.\"\f4root\fP is its identity.
.\"It is identified by the system as \f(CWTTY11\fP.
.\"The command adds the TTY to the system by adding a record
.\"to \f4/etc/saf/DIALUP/_pmtab\fP:

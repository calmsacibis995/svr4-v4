.SH NAME
\f4intro\f1 \- introduction to maintenance commands and application programs
.SH DESCRIPTION
This section describes, in alphabetical order, commands
that are used chiefly for system maintenance and administration purposes.
The commands in this section should be used along with those
listed in Section 1 of the
\f2User's Reference Manual\f1
and Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
of the
\f2Programmer's Reference Manual\f1.
References of the form
\f2name\f1(1), (2), (3), (4) and (5)
refer to entries in the above manuals.
References of the form
.IR name (1M),
.IR name (7)
or 
.IR name (8)
refer to entries in this manual.
.PP
Because of command restructuring for the Virtual File System
architecture, there are several instances of
multiple manual pages with the same name.
For example, there are four manual pages called
\f4mount\fP(1M).
In each such case the first of the multiple
pages describes the syntax and options of the
generic command, that is, those options applicable
to all FSTypes (file system types).
The succeeding pages describe the functionality
of the FSType-specific modules of the command.
These pages all display the name of the FSType
to which they pertain centered and in parentheses
at the top of the page.
Note that the administrator should not attempt to
call these modules directly.
The generic command provides a common interface
to all of them.
Thus the FSType-specific manual pages should not be viewed
as describing distinct commands, but rather as
detailing those aspects of a command
that are specific to a particular FSType.
.SH COMMAND SYNTAX
Unless otherwise noted, commands described in this section accept options and
other arguments according to the following syntax:
.P
.RS
.I name
.RI [ option ( s )]
.RI [ cmdarg ( s )]
.RE
where:
.TP 13
.I name
The name of an executable file
.TP
.I option\^
\f4\-\f1
.IR noargletter ( s )
or,
.br
\f4\-\f1
.IR argletter <\|> optarg
.br
where <\|> is optional white space
.TP
.I noargletter\^
A single letter representing an option without an argument
.TP
.I argletter\^
A single letter representing an option requiring an argument
.TP
.I optarg\^
Argument (character string) satisfying preceding
.IR argletter
.TP
.I cmdarg\^
Pathname (or other command argument)
.I not\^
beginning with
\f4\-\f1
or,
\f4\-\f1
by itself indicating the standard input
.SH SEE ALSO
\f4getopt\fP(1)
in the
\f2User's Reference Manual\f1.
.br
\f4getopt\fP(3C) in the
\f2Programmer's Reference Manual\f1.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Upon termination, each command returns
0 for normal termination and non-zero
to indicate troubles such as erroneous parameters, bad or inaccessible data,
or other inability to cope with the task at hand.
It is called variously ``exit code,'' ``exit status,'' or
``return code,'' and is described only where special
conventions are involved.
.SH NOTES
Unfortunately, not all commands adhere to the standard syntax.

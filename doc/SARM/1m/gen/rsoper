.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4rsoper \-d\f1
identifies media containing backup archives of file systems
and data partitions,
and allows an operator to complete pending
\f4restore\f1(1M)
and
\f4urestore\f1(1M)
requests.
\f4rsoper\fP takes information about the archive entered
on the command line and matches it against pending
\f4restore\fP or \f4urestore\fP
requests in the restore status table.
\f4rsoper\fP then invokes the proper archiving method to
read the archive and extract requested files,
directories, and data partitions.
As subsequent archive volumes are needed, the operator is
requested to insert or mount the appropriate archive volumes.
See
\f4getvol\f1(1M).
.P
Depending on the information available
in \f4bkhist.tab\f1 and the volume labeling 
technique (internal or external),
all options and arguments listed below may not be required.
If required fields are omitted,
\f4rsoper\fP
issues an error message indicating the
information that is needed.
The command can then be reissued with the appropriate fields specified.
.P
\f4rsoper\fP
may be executed only by a user with superuser privileges.
.P
\f4rsoper \f4\-r\f1
removes a pending restore job from the
restore status table 
(see \f4rsstatus\f1(1M) and \f4ursstatus\f1(1M))
and notifies the requesting user that 
the job has been marked complete.
.P
\f4rsoper \f4\-c\f1
removes a pending restore job from the
restore status table 
(see \f4rsstatus\f1(1M) and \f4ursstatus\f1(1M))
and notifies the requesting user that 
the job has been canceled.
.SS Options
.TP 10
\f4\-c \f2jobid\f1
Cancels a pending restore request and notifies the originating
user that the request has been canceled.
.TP 10
\f4\-d \f2ddev\f1
Describes the device that will be used to read the
archive containing the required file system or data partition.
.I ddev
is of the form:
.IP
     \f2ddevice\f1[\f4:\f1[\f2dchar\f1][\f4:\f1[\f2dmnames\f1]]]
.IP
.I ddevice
is the device name for the device; see
\f4device.tab\f1(4).
.I dchar
describes characteristics associated with the device.
.I dchar
is of the form:
.IP
     \f1[\f4density=\f2density\f1] [\f4blk_fac=\f2blockingfactor\f1] [\f4mntpt=\f2dir\f1]
.IP
If \f4mntpt=\f2dir\f1 is specified,
.I ddevice
is assumed to be a file system partition and
.I dir
is the place in the \s-1UNIX\s+1\*(rg directory structure where
.I ddevice
will be mounted.
This is valid only for \f4fimage\f1(1M) archives.
.I dmnames
is a list of volume labels, 
separated by either commas or blanks.
If the list is blank separated, the entire
.I ddev
argument must be surrounded by quotes.
.TP 10
\f4\-j\f2 jobids\f1
Limits the scope of the request to the jobs specified.
.I jobids
is a list of restore job \s-1ID\s+1s
(either comma separated or blank separated and surrounded by quotes).
.TP 10
\f4\-m \f2method\f1
Assumes the archive on the
first volume in the destination device was created by the
.I method
archiving operation.
Valid \f2methods\f1 are:
\f4incfile\f1,
\f4ffile\f1,
\f4fimage\f1,
\f4fdp\f1,
\f4fdisk\f1,
and any customized methods in the \f4/etc/bkup/method\f1 directory.
This option is required 
if the backup history log is not available, 
if the log does not include
information about the specified archive
or if \f4rsoper\fP
cannot determine the format of the archive.
.TP 10
\f4\f4\-n\f1
Displays attributes of the specified destination
device but does not attempt to service pending
restore requests.
.TP 10
\f4\-o\f2 oname\f1[\f4:\f2odevice\f1]
Specifies the originating file system partition
or data partition to be restored.
.I oname
is the name of the the originating file system.
It may be null.
.I odevice
is the device name of the originating file
system or data partition.
This option is required if the backup history log is not available or
does not include information about the specified archive.
.TP 10
\f4\-r\f2 jobid\f1
Removes the restore request for the specified job.
.TP 10
\f4\-s\f1
While a restore operation is occurring, this option
displays a period (\0\f4.\f1\0)
for each 100 (512-byte) blocks transferred from the
destination device.
.TP 10
\f4\-t\f1
Assumes that the volume inserted in the destination device
contains a table of contents for an archive.
This option is
required if the backup history log is not available, 
if the log does not include
information about the specified archive,
or if \f4rsoper\fP
cannot determine the format of the volume.
.TP 10
\f4\-u\f2 user\f1
Restricts restores to those requested by the user specified.
.TP 10
\f4\-v\f1
Displays the name of each object as it is restored.
Only those archiving methods that restore named directories
and files (\f4incfile\f1 and \f4ffile\f1) support this option.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS 
The exit codes for \f4rsoper\f1 are the following:
.PP
\f40\f1 = the task completed successfully
.br
\f41\f1 = one or more parameters to \f4rsoper\fP are invalid
.br
\f42\f1 = an error has occurred, causing \f4rsoper\fP to fail to
      complete all portions of its task
.P
If a method reports that no part of a restore request was
completed,
\f4rsoper\fP
reports this fact to the user.
.bp
.SH EXAMPLES
Example 1:
.P
.in 1.0i
\f4rsoper \-d /dev/tape/c4d0s2\fP
.in 0
.P
asks the restore service to read the archive volume that has
been inserted into the device \f4/dev/tape/c4d0s2\f1.
The service will attempt to resolve any restore
requests that can be satisfied by the archive volume.
.P
Example 2:
.P
The following example assumes that the backup history table contains
a record of backups performed and
that the restore status table contains a record of the restore requests.
The command line
.P
.in 1.0i
\f4rsoper \-d /dev/ctape:density=1600:USRLBL1
\-v \-u clerk1\fP
.in 0
.P
instructs the restore service to perform only
pending restore requests from the \f4rsstatus.tab\f1 
table issued by \f4clerk1\f1.
The restore procedures are to be done from the
cartridge tape labeled \s-1USRLBL1\s+1, with a density of 1600 bps.
The restore service will display on the operator terminal
the names of the files and directories
as they are successfully restored.
.P
Example 3:
.P
The following example assumes that the
backup history table no longer contains a log of
the requested backup operations.
With that assumption:
.P
\f4rsoper \-d /dev/diskette2:blk_fac=2400:arc.dec79
\-m incfile \-o /usr2\fP
.P
instructs the restore service to perform a restore
of the \f4/usr2\f1 file system using the incremental
restore method.
The \f4/usr2\f1 file system is to be
restored from archived diskettes with a blocking factor
of 2400.
The diskettes containing the archive are labeled
``arc.dec79.a,'' 
``arc.dec79.b,''
and ``arc.dec79.c.''
.P
Example 4:
.P
.in 1.0i
\f4rsoper \-c rest-737b\fP
.in 0
.P
cancels the restore request with the job \s-1ID\s+1 \f4rest-737b\f1.

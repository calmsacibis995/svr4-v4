.SH NAME
\f4share\f1 \- make local RFS resource available for mounting by remote systems
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4share\f1
[\f4\-F \f1rfs\f1]
[\f4\-o \f2access_spec\f1]
[\f4\-d \f2description\f1]
[\f2pathname \f2resourcename\f1]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\f4share\f1
command makes a resource available for mounting through Remote File
Sharing.
The \f4\-F\f1 flag may be omitted if rfs is the first file system type
listed in the file \f4/etc/dfs/fstypes\f1.  When invoked with
only a file system type (or no arguments),
\f4share\f1 displays all local resources shared through Remote File Sharing.
.P
The \f2access_spec\f1 is used to control client access 
of the shared resource.
Clients may be specified in any of the following forms:
.nf

	\f2domain.\fP
	\f2domain.system\fP
	\f2system\fP

.fi
The \f2access_spec\f1 can be one of the following:
.RS 5
.IP rw 15
\f2resourcename\f1 is shared read/write to all clients.
This is also the default behavior.
.IP rw=\f2client\f1[\f2:client\f1]... 15
\f2resourcename\f1 is shared read/write only to the
listed clients.  No other systems can
access \f2resourcename\f1.
.IP ro 15
\f2resourcename\f1 is shared read-only to all clients.
.IP ro=\f2client\f1[\f2:client\f1]... 15
\f2resourcename\f1 is shared read-only only to the
listed clients.  No other systems can
access \f2resourcename\f1.
.RE
.P
The \f4\-d\f1 flag may be used to provide a description of the
resource being shared.
.SH ERRORS
If the network is not up and running or \f2pathname\f1 is not a full path,
an error message will be sent to standard error.
If \f2pathname\f1 isn't on a file system mounted locally or
the \f2client\f1 is specified but syntactically incorrect, an
error message will be sent to standard error.  If the
same \f2resource\f1 name in the network over the same transport provider
is to be shared more than once, an error message will be sent to standard error.

.SH NAME
\f4acctprc\f1, \f4acctprc1\f1, \f4acctprc2\f1 \- process accounting
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/usr/lib/acct/acctprc\f1
.sp .15
\f4/usr/lib/acct/acctprc1\f1
[\^\f2ctmp\fP\^]
.sp .15
\f4/usr/lib/acct/acctprc2\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4acctprc\f1 reads standard input, in the form described by
\f4acct(4)\f1, and converts it to total accounting records
(see the \f4tacct\f1 record in \f4acct(4)\f1).
\f4acctprc\f1 divides CPU time into prime time and non-prime time and
determines mean memory size (in memory segment units).
\f4acctprc\f1 then summarizes the \f4tacct\f1 records, according
to user IDs, and adds login names corresponding to the user IDs.
The summarized records are then written to standard output.
\f4acctprc1\fP
reads input in the form described by
\f4acct\fP(4),
adds login names corresponding to user
.SM ID\*Ss,
then writes for each process an
.SM ASCII
line giving
user
.SM ID\*S,
login name,
prime
.SM CPU
time (tics),
non-prime
.SM CPU
time (tics),
and mean memory size (in memory segment units).
If
.I ctmp
is given,
it is expected to contain a list of login sessions
sorted by user
.SM ID
and login name.
If this file is not supplied,
it obtains login names from the password file, just as
\f4acctprc\f1 does.
The information in
.I ctmp
helps it distinguish between different login names sharing the same user
.SM ID\*S.
.PP
From standard input,
\f4acctprc2\fP
reads records in the form written by
\f4acctprc1\fP,
summarizes them according to user
.SM ID
and name,
then writes the sorted summaries to the standard output
as total accounting records.
.SH EXAMPLES
The \f4acctprc\f1 command is typically used as shown below:
.PP
.RS
\f4acctprc \|< /var/adm/pacct \|> ptacct\f1
.RE
.PP
The \f4acctprc1\f1 and \f4acctprc2\f1 commands are typically used as
shown below:
.PP
.RS
\f4acctprc1 \|ctmp \|</var/adm/pacct \|\(bv \|acctprc2 \|>ptacct\f1
.RE
.SH FILES

.SH NOTES
Although it is possible for \f4acctprc1\f1 to distinguish among login names
that share user
.SM ID\*Ss
for commands run normally,
it is difficult to do this for those commands run from
\f4cron\fP(1M),
for example.
A more precise conversion can be done using the
\f4acctwtmp\fP
program in
\f4acct\fP(1M).
\f4acctprc\f1 does not distinguish between users with identical user IDs.
.P
A memory segment of the mean memory size is a unit of measure
for the number of bytes in a logical memory segment on a particular
processor.

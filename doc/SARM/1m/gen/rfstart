.SH NAME
\f4rfstart\f1 \- start Remote File Sharing
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4rfstart\f1
[\f4\-v\f1] [\f4\-p\f2 primary_addr\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4rfstart\f1 starts Remote File Sharing and defines an authentication
level for incoming requests.
[This command can only be used
after the domain name server is set up and your computer's
domain name and network specification have been defined using \f4dname\f1(1M).]
.IP \-v 8
Specifies that verification of all clients is required in response to
initial incoming mount requests; any host not in  the file
\f4/etc/rfs/auth.info/\f2domain\f1/passwd for the
\f4domain\f1 they belong to, will not be allowed to mount resources from
your host.
If \f4\-v\f1 is not specified, hosts named in
\f2domain\f1/passwd will be verified.
Other hosts will be allowed
to connect without verification.
.IP \-p\ \f2primary_addr\f1 8
Indicates the primary domain name server for your domain.
\f2primary_addr\f1 can specify any of the following:
the network address of\p
.br
the primary name server for a domain (\f2addr\f1);
a list of address tuples when RFS is used over multiple transport providers
(\f2transport1:addr1,transport2:addr2, \f1. . .).
An example of each type
of specification follows:
.sp .5
.RS 8
\f4\-p \f2addr\f1
.br
\f4\-p \f2transport1:addr1,transport2:addr2, \f1. . .
.RE
.PP
If the \f4\-p\f1 option is not specified, the address of the
domain name server is taken from the associated \f4rfmaster\f1 files.
The \f4\-p \f2addr\f1 specification is valid only when one transport
provider is being used.
See the \f4rfmaster\f1(1M) manual page for
a description of the valid address syntax.
.P
If the host password has not been set, \f4rfstart\f1
will prompt for a password.
The password prompting process must
match the password entered for your machine at the primary
domain name server [see \f4rfadmin\f1(1M)].
If you remove the \f4loc.passwd\f1 file or change domains, you will
also have to reenter the password.
.P
Also, when \f4rfstart\f1 is run on a domain name server, entries
in the
\f4rfmaster\f1(4)
file are syntactically validated.
.P
This command is restricted to the super-user.
.SH "ERRORS"
If syntax errors are found when validating an
\f4rfmaster\f1(4)
file, a warning describing each error will be sent to standard error.
.P
An error message will be sent to standard error if any of the
following conditions are true:
.sp .5
.nf
	1.  remote file sharing is already running
	2.  there is no communications network
	3.  a domain name server cannot be found
	4.  a domain name server does not recognize the machine
	5.  the command is run without super-user privileges
.fi
.P
Remote file sharing will not start if a host password in
\f4/etc/rfs/\f2<transport>\f4/loc.passwd\f1 is corrupted.
If you suspect this
has happened, remove the file and run \f4rfstart\f1 again to
reenter your password.
.P
Note: \f4rfstart\f1 will not fail if your host password does not match
the password on the domain name server.
You will simply receive a warning message.
However, if you try to mount a resource
from the primary, or any other host that validates your password, the
mount will fail if your password does not match the one that the host has
listed for your machine.

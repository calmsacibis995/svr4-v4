.SH NAME
\f4ufsrestore\f1 \- incremental file system restore
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/usr/sbin/ufsrestore\f1
.I options
[
.IR filename .\|.\|.
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\f4ufsrestore\f1
restores files from backup tapes created with the
\f4ufsdump\f1.
command.
.I options
is a string of at least one of the options listed
below, along with
any modifiers and arguments you supply.
Remaining arguments to
\f4ufsrestore\f1
are the names of files (or directories whose files)
are to be restored to disk.
Unless the
\f4h\f1
modifier is in effect, a directory name refers
to the files it contains, and (recursively) its
subdirectories and the files they contain.
.LP
The options are:
.TP .75i
\f4\-i\f1
Interactive.
After reading in the directory information from
the tape,
\f4ufsrestore\f1
invokes an interactive interface that allows
you to browse through the dump tape's directory
hierarchy and select individual files to be extracted.
See \f4Interactive Commands\f1,
below, for a description of available commands.
.TP .75i
\f4\-r\f1
Restore the entire tape.
Load the tape's full contents into the
current directory. 
This option should be used only to restore a
complete dump tape onto a clear filesystem,
or to restore an incremental dump tape after a full
\(lqlevel 
\f40\f1\(rq
restore. 
.TP
\f4\-R\f1
Resume restoring.
\f4ufsrestore\f1
requests a particular tape of a \%multivolume set
from which to resume a full restore (see the
\f4\-r\f1
\%option above).
This allows
\f4ufsrestore\f1
to start from a checkpoint when it is interrupted
in the middle of a full restore.
.TP .75i
\f4\-t\f1
Table of contents. 
List each
.I filename
that appears on the tape.
If no
.I filename
argument is given, the root directory is listed.
This results in a list of all files on the tape,
unless the
\f4\-h\f1
modifier is in effect.
.TP .75i
\f4\-x\f1
Extract the named files from the tape.
If a named file matches a
directory whose contents were written onto the tape, and the
\f4\-h\f1
modifier is not in effect, the directory is recursively extracted.
The owner, modification time, and mode are restored (if possible).
If no
.I filename
argument is given, the root directory is extracted.
This results in the entire tape being extracted unless the
\f4\-h\f1
modifier is in effect.
.TP .75i
\f4\-c\f1
Convert the contents of the dump tape to the new
filesystem format.
.TP .75i
\f4\-d\f1
Debug. 
Turn on debugging output.
.TP .75i
\f4h\f1
Extract the actual directory,
rather than the files that it references.
This prevents hierarchical restoration
of complete subtrees from the tape.
.TP .75i
\f4m\f1
Extract by inode numbers rather than by filename to
avoid regenerating complete pathnames.
This is useful if
only a few files are being extracted.
.TP .75i
\f4v\f1
Verbose.
\f4ufsrestore\f1
displays the name of each file it restores, preceded by its file type.
.TP .75i
\f4y\f1
Do not ask whether to abort the restore in the event of tape errors.
\%\f4ufsrestore\f1
tries to skip over the bad tape block(s) and continue as best it can.
.TP .75i
\f4b\f2 factor\f1
Blocking factor.
Specify the blocking factor for tape reads.
By default,
\f4ufsrestore\f1
will attempt to figure out the block size of the tape.
.br
Note: a tape block is 512 bytes.
.TP .75i
\f4f\f2 dump-file\f1
Use
.I dump-file
instead of
\f4/dev/dump?\f1
as the file to restore from.
If
\%\f2dump-file\f1
is specified as
\f1`\f4\-\f1',
\f4ufsrestore\f1
reads from the standard input.
.ne 5
This allows,
\f4ufsdump\f1(1M)
and
\f4ufsrestore\f1
to be used in a pipeline to dump and restore a file system:
.RS
.IP
\f4example# ufsdump  0f \- /dev/rxy0g  |  (cd /mnt; ufsrestore xf \-)\f1
.RE
.IP
If the name of the file is of the form
\f2machine\f4:\f2device\f1
the restore is done from the specified machine over the network using
\f4rmt\f1(1M).
Since
\%\f4ufsrestore\f1
is normally run by root,
the name of the local machine must appear in the
\f4\&.rhosts\f1
file of the remote machine.
If the file is specified as
\f2user\f4!\f2machine\f4:\f2device\f1,\f1
\f4ufsrestore\f1
will attempt to execute as the specified user on the remote machine.
The specified user must have a
\f4\&.rhosts\f1
file on the remote machine that allows root from the local machine.
If
\f4ufsrestore\f1
is called as
\f4ufsrrestore,\f1
the tape defaults to
\f4dumphost:/dev/rmt8\f1\f1.
To direct the input from a desired remote machine,
set up an alias for
\%\f4dumphost\f1
in the file
\f4/etc/hosts\f1.
.TP .75i
\f4s\f2 n\f1
Skip to the
.IR n 'th
file when there are multiple dump files on the same tape.
For example, the command:
.RS
.IP
\f4example# ufsrestore xfs /dev/nrar0 5\f1
.RE
.IP
would position you at the fifth file on the tape.
.LP
\f4ufsrestore\f1
enters interactive mode when invoked with the
\f4i\f1
option.
Interactive commands are reminiscent of the shell.
For those commands that accept an argument, the default is the current
directory.
.TP 15
\f4ls\f1[\f2directory\f1]\f1
List files in
\f4directory\fP
or the current directory, represented by a 
\f1`\f4.\f1'
(period).
Directories are appended with a
\f1`\f4/\f1'
(backslash).
Entries marked for extraction are prefixed with a
\f1`\f4*\f1'
(asterisk).
If the verbose option is in effect, inode numbers are also listed.
.TP
\f4cd\f2 directory\f1
Change to directory
\f4directory\fP
(within the dump-tape).
.TP
\f4pwd\f1
Print the full pathname of the current working directory.
.TP
\f4add\f1[\f2filename\f1]\f1
Add the current directory, or the named file or directory
\f4directory\f1
to the list of files to extract.
If a directory is specified, add that
directory and its files (recursively) to
the extraction list (unless the
\f4h\f1
modifier is in effect).
.TP
\f4delete\f1[\f2filename\f1]\f1
.br
Delete the current directory, or the
named file or directory from the list of
files to extract.
If a directory is specified, delete that
directory and all its descendents from the
extraction list (unless the
\f4h\f1
modifier is in effect).
The most expedient way to extract
a majority of files from a directory is to add
that directory to the
extraction list,
and then delete specific files to omit.
.TP
\f4extract\f1
Extract all files on the extraction list from the dump tape.
\%\f4ufsrestore\f1
asks which volume the user wishes to mount.
The fastest way to extract a
small number of files is to start with the
last tape volume and work toward the first.
.TP
\f4verbose\f1
Toggle the status of the
\f4v\f1
modifier.
While
\f4v\f1
is in effect, the
\f4ls\f1
command lists the inode numbers of all entries, and
\f4ufsrestore\f1
displays information about each file as it is extracted.
.TP
\f4help\f1
Display a summary of the available commands.
.TP
\f4quit\f1
\f4ufsrestore\f1
exits immediately, even if the extraction list is not empty.
.SH NOTES
.LP
\f4ufsrestore\f1
can get confused when doing incremental restores from
dump tapes that were made on active file systems.
.LP
A \(lqlevel 
\f40\f1\(rq
dump must be done after a full restore.
Because 
\f4ufsrestore \f1
runs in user mode,
it has no control over inode allocation;
this means that
\f4ufsrestore\f1
repositions the files, although it
does not change their contents. 
Thus, a full dump must be done to get a
new set of directories reflecting the new file positions, so that later
incremental dumps will be correct.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.LP
\f4ufsrestore\f1
complains about bad option characters.
.LP
Read errors result in complaints.
If
\f4y\f1
has been specified, or the user responds
\f4y\f1,
\f4ufsrestore\f1
will attempt to continue.
.LP
If the dump extends over more than one tape,
\f4ufsrestore\f1
asks the user to change tapes. 
If the
\f4x\f1
or
\f4i\f1
option has been specified,
\f4ufsrestore\f1
also asks which volume the user wishes to mount.
.LP
There are numerous consistency checks that can be listed by
\f4ufsrestore\f1.
Most checks are self-explanatory or can \(lqnever happen\(rq.
Common errors are given below.
.TP
\f4Converting to new file system format.\f1
A dump tape created from the old file system has been loaded.
It is automatically converted to the new file system format.
.TP
\f2filename\f4: not found on tape\f1
The specified file name was listed in the tape directory,
but was not found on the tape.
This is caused by tape read errors while looking for the file,
and from using a dump tape created on an active file system.
.TP
\f4expected next file \f2inumber\f4, got \f2inumber\f1
A file that was not listed in the directory showed up.
This can occur when using a dump tape created on an active file system.
.TP
\f4Incremental tape too low\f1
When doing an incremental restore,
a tape that was written before the previous incremental tape,
or that has too low an incremental level has been loaded.
.TP
\f4Incremental tape too high\f1
When doing incremental restore,
a tape that does not begin its coverage
where the previous incremental tape left off,
or one that has too high an incremental level
has been loaded.
.br
.ne 10
.TP
\f4Tape read error while restoring \f2filename\f1
.PD 0
.TP
\f4Tape read error while skipping over inode  inumber\f1
.TP
\f4Tape read error while trying to resynchronize\f1
.TP
\f4A tape read error has occurred.\f1
If a file name is specified,
then its contents are probably partially wrong.
If an inode is being skipped or the tape is trying to resynchronize,
then no extracted files have been corrupted,
though files may not be found on the tape.
.ne 4
.TP
\f4resync ufsrestore, skipped \f2num\f1
After a tape read error,
\f4ufsrestore\f1
may have to resynchronize itself.
This message lists the number of blocks that were skipped over.

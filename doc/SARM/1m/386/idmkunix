.SH NAME
\f4idmkunix\f1 \- build new UNIX System kernel
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/etc/conf/bin/idmkunix\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4idmkunix\f1 command creates a bootable UNIX Operating System
kernel in the directory
\f4/etc/conf/cf.d\f1 .
The component kernel "core" files and device driver object files
contained in subdirectories of
\f4/etc/conf/pack.d\f1
are used as input along with device and parameter definition
files produced by \f4idconfig\f1.
In brief, the required input files are as follows:
.PP
.RS 3
.nf
.ta 2i
\f4/etc/conf/cf.d/conf.c\f1	\- Kernel data structures and function
	   definitions
\f4/etc/conf/cf.d/config.h\f1	\- Kernel parameter and device definitions
\f4/etc/conf/cf.d/vector.c\f1	\- Interrupt vector definitions
\f4/etc/conf/cf.d/direct\f1	\- Listing of all driver components included
                         	   in the build
\f4/etc/conf/cf.d/fsconf.c\f1	\- File system type configuration data
\f4/etc/conf/cf.d/vuifile\f1	\- Memory management definitions for
	   the kernel
\f4/etc/conf/pack.d/*/Driver.o\f1	\- Component kernel object files
\f4/etc/conf/pack.d/*/space.c\f1	\- Component kernel space allocation files
\f4/etc/conf/pack.d/*/stubs.c\f1	\- Component kernel stubs files

\f4/etc/conf/cf.d\f1
can be found in the directory specified.
.TP
\f4\-r \f2directory\f1
The directory specified will be used as the ID "root" directory
rather than
\f4/etc/conf\f1 .

.SH NAME
\f4xfsck\f1 \- check and repair XENIX filesystems
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/bin/xfsck\f1
[\f2options\f1] [\f4filesystem\f1] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\f4xfsck\f1
command audits and interactively repairs inconsistent conditions for 
XENIX
System V filesystems.
If the file\%system is consistent,
then
\f4xfsck\f1
reports number of files, number of blocks
used, and number of blocks free.
If the filesystem is inconsistent, the 
user is prompted whether or not
\f4xfsck\f1 
should proceed with each correction.
It should be noted that most corrective actions 
result in some loss of data.
The amount and severity of the loss can be determined 
from the diagnostic output.
If the user does not have write permission,
\f1xfsck\f1\^
defaults to the  action of the
\f4\-n\f1 
option.
.PP
The 
\f4xfsck\f1
options are:
.TP 8
\f4\-y\f1
Assumes a 
.Q yes
response to all questions asked by 
\f4xfsck\f1.
.TP 8
\f4\-n\f1
Assumes a
.Q no
response to all questions asked by 
\f4xfsck\f1.
This option does not open the filesystem for writing.
.TP 8
\f4-s \f2b\^\f1:\f2c\f1
Ignores the actual free list and unconditionally reconstructs a new
one by rewriting the super-block of the filesystem.  
The filesystem 
.I must 
be unmounted while this is done.
.IP
This
option allows for creating an optimal free-list organization.
The following forms are supported:
.sp .5
.nf
'\"	-s3 (\s-1RP\s+1\&03)
'\"	-s4 (\s-1RP\s+1\&04, \s-1RP\s+1\&05, \s-1RP\s+1\&06)
\0\0-s
.sp .5
\0\0-sBlocks-per-cylinder\fB:\fRBlocks-to-skip (filesystem interleave)
.fi
.IP "" 8
If \f2b\^\f1:\f2c\f1
is not given, then the values that were used 
when the filesystem was created are used again.
If these values were not specified, 
then the default value is used.
.TP 8
\f4-S\f1 
Conditionally reconstructs the free list.
This option is similar to
\%\f4-s\0\f2b\^\f1:\f2c\f1
above, except that the free list is rebuilt only
if there are no discrepancies discovered in the
filesystem. The
\f4-S\f1
option forces a ``no'' response to all questions asked by
\f4xfsck\f1.
This option is useful for forcing free-list reorganization
on uncontaminated filesystems.
.br
.ne 8
.TP 8
\f4-t\f1
Causes
\f4xfsck\f1
to use the next argument as
the scratch file, if needed. A scratch file is used if
\f4xfsck\f1
cannot obtain enough memory to keep its tables.  Without the
\f4-t\f1 flag,
\f4xfsck\f1
prompts the user for the name of the
scratch file. 
The file chosen should not be on the
filesystem being checked. In addition, if the scratch file is not
a special file or did not already exist, it is removed when
\f4xfsck\f1
completes.  Note that if the system has a large hard disk,
there may not be enough space on another filesystem for the
scratch file.
In such cases, if the system has a floppy disk drive, use
a blank, formatted floppy disk in the floppy disk drive 
with (for example)
\f4/dev/fd0\f1
specified as the scratch file.
.TP 8
\f4-q\f1
Causes
\f4xfsck\f1 
to perform a quiet check.
Does not print size-check messages in Phase 1.  Unreferenced
.B fifo5
files are selectively removed.  If
\f4xfsck\f1
requires it, counts in the superblock are automatically
fixed and the free list salvaged.
.TP 8
\f4-D\f1
Checks directories for bad blocks.  Use this option 
after the system crashes.
.TP 8
\f4-f\f1
Causes
\f4xfsck\f1
to perform a fast check.  
\f4xfsck\f1
checks block and sizes (Phase 1) and checks the
free list (Phase 5).  The free list is reconstructed
(Phase 6), if necessary.
.TP 8
\f4\-rr\f1
Recovers the root filesystem.  The required 
.I filesystem
argument must refer to the root filesystem,
and preferably to the block device (normally 
\f4/dev/root\f1 ).
This switch implies 
\f4-y\f1
(yes) and overrides 
\f4-n\f1 
(no).
If any modifications to the filesystem are required,
the system will be automatically shutdown 
to ensure the integrity of the filesystem.
.TP 8
\f4-c\f1
Causes any supported filesystem to be converted to the
current filesystem type. The user is prompted to verify
the conversion of each filesystem, unless the
\f4-y\f1
option is specified.  It is recommended that every filesystem 
be checked with this option
.I "while unmounted"
if it is to be used with the current version of XENIX.
To update the active root filesystem, check it with the 
following command line:
.in +5
.sp .5
\f4xfsck\ -c\ \-rr\ /dev/root\f1
.in -5
.PP
If no
.I filesystems\^
are specified,
\f4xfsck\f1
reads a list of default filesystems from
the 
\f4/etc/checklist\f1
file.

The following are some of the inconsistencies 
\f4xfsck\f1
checks for:
.TP 4
\- 
Blocks claimed by more than one inode or the free list

\- 
Blocks claimed by an inode or the free list outside the 
range of the filesystem

.PP
With the user's consent,
\f4xfsck\f1
reconnects orphaned (allocated, but unreferenced) files and
directories by placing them in the
.I lost+found 
directory.  The file's (or directory's) inode number then
becomes its name.  Note that the 
.I lost+found
directory must already exist
in the root of the filesystem being checked and
must have empty slots in which entries can be made.
To create the
.I lost+found 
directory, copy a few files to the directory, then remove them
(before executing
\f4xfsck\f1 ).

.SH NOTES
\f4xfsck\f1
will not run on a mounted non-raw filesystem, unless the 
filesystem is the root filesystem, or the 
\f4\-n\f1 
option is specified and no writing out of the filesystem
will take place.  If any such attempt is made, 
\f4xfsck\f1
displays a warning and no further
processing of the filesystem is done for the specified device.
.PP
\f4xfsck\f1
does not support filesystems created under XENIX-86 version 3.0
because the word order in type
.I long
variables has changed.
However,
\f4xfsck\f1
is capable of auditing and repairing XENIX version 3.0 
filesystems if the word ordering is correct. 
.PP
Run
\f4xfsck\0-rr\0/dev/root\f1
for the root filesystem. Run
\f4xfsck\0/dev/??\f1
on the 
.I unmounted 
block device for all other filesystems. 
.PP
It is not recommended that users use
\f4xfsck\f1
on raw devices. Although
checking a raw device is almost always faster,
there is no way to tell if the filesystem is mounted.
If the filesystem is mounted, cleaning it will almost certainly
result in an inconsistent superblock.

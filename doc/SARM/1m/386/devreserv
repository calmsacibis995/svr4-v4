.SH NAME
\f4devreserv\f1 \- reserves devices for exclusive use
.SH SYNOPSIS
.ft CW
devreserv \f1[\f2pid\f4 \f1[\f2devicelist\f4 \f1[\f4...\f1]\|]\|]
.ft 1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4devreserv\f1
reserves devices for exclusive use.
When the device is no longer required, use \f4devfree\f1 to release it.
.P
\f4devreserv\f1
reserves at most one device per \f2devicelist\f1.
Each list is searched in linear order until the first available device is found.
If a device cannot be reserved from each list, the entire reservation fails.
.P
When \f4devreserv\f1 is invoked without arguments, it lists the devices that
are currently reserved and shows to which pid it was reserved.
When \f4devreserv\f1 is invoked with only the \f2pid\f1 argument,
it lists the
devices that currently reserved to that process id.
.P
The arguments for this command are:
.P
.PD 0
.TP 10
\f2pid\f1
Designates the application's process id number on which the device will be
reserved.
.sp
.TP 10
\f2devicelist\f1
Defines a list of devices that \f4devreserv\f1 will search to find
an available device.  (The list must be formatted as a single argument to the
shell.)
.PD
.SH EXAMPLE
To reserve a floppy disk and a cartridge tape:
.P
.ft CW
.nf
	$ key=$$ 
	$ echo "The current Process ID is equal to: $key"
	The Current Process ID is equal to: 10658
	$ devreserv $key diskett1,ctape1
	/dev/dsk/f0t
	/dev/rmt/c0s0
.fi
.ft 1
.P
To list all devices currently reserved:
.P
.ft CW
.nf
	$ devreserv
	disk1         2423
	/dev/dsk/f0t
	/dev/rmt/c0s0
.fi
.ft 1
.P
To list all devices currently reserved to a particular key:
.P
.ft CW
.nf
	$ devreserv $key
	/dev/dks/f0t
	/dev//rmt/c0s0
.fi
.ft 1
.SH ERRORS 
The command will exit with one of the following values:
.TP 4
\f40\f1 =
successful completion of the task.
.TP 4
\f41\f1 =
command syntax incorrect, invalid option used, or internal error occurred.
.TP 4
\f42\f1 =
device table or device reservation table could not be opened for reading.
.TP 4
\f43\f1 =
device reservation request could not be fulfilled.

.SH NOTES
The commands \f4devreserv\f1 and \f4devfree\f1 are used to manage the
availability of devices on a system.
Their use is 
on a participatory basis and they do not place any 
constraints on the actual access to the device.
They serve as a centralized
bookkeeping point for those who wish to use them.
To summarize, devices which have been reserved 
cannot be used by processes which utilize the device reservation functions
until the reservation has been canceled.
However, processes that do not use device reservation
may use a device that has been reserved
since such a process would not have checked for its reservation
status.
The \f2pid\f1 argument must be the process id of the controlling process.
This
process should be active both when the device is reserved and when 
it is freed.
When a process becomes inactive, all devices reserved to the process id are 
canceled by the system.

.SH NAME
\f4idtune\f1 \- attempts to set value of a tunable parameter
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/etc/conf/bin/idtune\f1  [ \f4\-f\f1 | \-\f4m\f1 ]  \f2name  value\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
This script attempts to set the value of a tunable parameter.
The tunable parameter to be changed is indicated by
.IR name .
The desired value for the tunable parameter is
.IR value .
.P
If there is already a value for this parameter
(in the \f4stune\f1 file),
the user will normally be asked to confirm the change
with the following message:
.P
.RS
Tunable Parameter \f2name\f1 is currently set to \f2old_value\f1.
.br
Is it OK to change it to \f2value\f1? (y/n)
.RE
.P
If the user answers y, the change will be made.
Otherwise, the tunable parameter will not be changed,
and the following message will be displayed:
.P
.RS
\f2name\f1 left at \f2old_value\f1.
.RE
.P
However, if the \f4\-f\f1 (force) option is used,
the change will always be made
and no messages will ever be given.
.P
If the \f4\-m\f1 (minimum) option is used and there is an existing value
which is greater than the desired value,
no change will be made and no message will be given.
.P
If system tunable parameters are being modified
as part of a device driver or application add-on package,
it may not be desirable to prompt the user with the above question.
The add-on package Install script may chose
to override the existing value using the
\f4\-f\f1
or
\f4\-m\f1
options.
However, care must be taken not to invalidate a tunable parameter
modified earlier by the user or another add-on package.
.P
In order for the change in parameter to become effective,
the UNIX System kernel must be rebuilt
and the system rebooted.
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"

.SH NAME
\f4fsba\f1 \- file system block analyzer
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/usr/sbin/fsba\f1
[ \f4\-b\fP \f2target_block_size\f1 ] \f2file-system1\f1 [ \f2file-system2\f1 ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\f4fsba\fP
command determines the disk space
required to store the data from an existing file system
in a new file system with the specified logical block size.
Each
.I file-system
listed on the command line refers to an existing file system and
should be specified by device name (e.g.,
\f4/dev/rdsk/c1d0s2\f1).
.PP
The
.I "target_block_size"
specifies the logical block size in bytes of the new file system.
Valid target block sizes are 512, 1024, and 2048.
Default target block size is 1024.
A block size of 2048 is supported only if the 2K file system
package is installed.
.PP
The
\f4fsba\fP
command prints information about how many 512-byte
disk sectors are allocated to store the data
in the old (existing) file system and how many would be required
to store the same data in a new file system with the specified logical block size.
It also prints the number of allocated
and free i-nodes for the existing file system.
.PP
If the number of free sectors listed for the new file system is
negative, the data will not fit in the new file system unless the new file
system is larger than the existing file system.
The new file system must be made at least as large as the number of sectors
listed by \f4fsba\f1 as allocated for the new file system.
The maximum size of the new file system is limited by the size of the disk
partition used for the new file system.
.PP
Note that it is possible to specify a
.I "target_block_size"
that is smaller than the logical block size of the existing file system.
In this case the new file system would require fewer sectors to store
the data.

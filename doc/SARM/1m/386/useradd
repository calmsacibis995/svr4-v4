.SH DESCRIPTION
Invoking \f4useradd\f1 without the \f4\-D\f1 option adds a new user entry
to the \f4/etc/passwd\f1 and \f4/etc/shadow\f1 files.
It also creates supplementary group memberships
for the user (\f4-G\f1 option)
and creates the home directory (\f4-m\f1 option)
for the user if requested.
The new login remains locked until the \f4passwd\f1(1M) command
is executed.
.P
Invoking \f4useradd \-D\f1 with no additional options displays the
default values for \f2group\fP, \f2base_dir\f1,
\f2shel_dir\f1, \f2shell\f1, \f2inactive\f1, and \f2expire\f1.
The values for \f2group\f1, \f2base_dir\f1,
\f2inactive\f1, \f2expire\f1, and \f2shell\f1
are used for invocations without the \f4\-D\f1 option.
.P
Invoking \f4useradd \-D\f1 with \f4\-g\f1, \f4\-b\f1,
\f4\-f\f1, or \f4\-e\f1 (or any combination of these)
sets the default values for the respective fields.
[As installed,
the default group is \f4other\f1 (group ID of \f41\f1)
and the default value of \f2base_dir\f1 is \f4/home\f1].
Subsequent invocations of \f4useradd\f1 without the \f4\-D\f1 option
use these arguments.
.P
The system file entries created with this command have a limit of 512
characters per line.
Specifying long arguments to several options may exceed this limit.
.P
The following options are available:
.TP .8i
\f4\-u \f2uid\f1
The 
.SM UID 
of the new user.
This 
.SM UID 
must be a non-negative decimal integer below
\f4MAXUID\f1
as defined in 
\f4<param.h>\f1.
The UID defaults to the next available (unique) number above the
highest number currently assigned.
For example, if UIDs 100, 105, and 200 are assigned, the
next default UID number will be 201.
(UIDs from 0-99 are reserved.)
.TP
\f4\-o\f1
This option allows a 
UID 
to be duplicated (non-unique).
.TP
\f4\-g \f2group\f1
An existing group's integer 
ID 
or character-string name.
Without the \f4\-D\f1 option, it defines the new user's primary
group membership and defaults to the default group.
You can reset this default value by invoking
\f4useradd \-D \-g \f2group\f1.
.TP
\f4\-G \f2group\f1
An existing group's integer 
ID 
or character-string name.
It defines the new user's supplementary group membership.
Duplicates between
\f2group\fP with the \f4\-g\f1 and \f4\-G\f1 options are ignored.
No more than \f4NGROUPS_MAX\f1
groups may be specified.
.TP
\f4\-d \f2dir\f1
The home directory of the new user.
It defaults to \f2base_dir/login\f1, where \f2base_dir\f1 is
the base directory for new login home directories
and \f2login\fP is the new login.
.TP
\f4\-s \f2shell\f1
Full pathname of the program used as the user's shell on login.
It defaults to an empty field
causing the system to use \f4/sbin/sh\f1 as the default.
The value of \f2shell\f1 must be a valid executable file.
.TP
\f4\-c \f2comment\f1
Any text string.
It is generally a short description of the login, and
is currently used as the field for the user's full name.
This information
is stored in the user's \f4/etc/passwd\f1 entry.
.TP
\f4\-m\f1
Create the new user's home directory if it doesn't already exist.
If the directory already exists,
it must have read, write, and execute permissions
by \f2group\fP, where \f2group\f1 is the user's primary group.
.TP
\f4\-k \f2skel_dir\f1
A directory that contains skeleton information (such as \f4.profile\f1)
that can be copied into a new user's home directory.
This directory must exist.
The system provides a ``skel'' directory
(\f4/etc/skel\f1)
that can be used for this purpose.
.TP
\f4\-e \f2expire\f1
The date on which a login can no longer be used;
after this date,
no user will be able to access this login.
(This option is useful for creating temporary logins.)
You may type the value of the argument \f2expire\fP 
(which is a date) in any format you like
(except a Julian date).
For example, you may enter
\f410/6/90\fP or \f4October 8, 1990\f1.
A value of \f4""\f1 defeats
the status of the expired date.
.TP 
\f4\-f \f2inactive\f1
The maximum number of days allowed 
between uses of a login
\f4ID\f1 before that login \f4ID\f1 is declared valid.
Normal values are positive integers.
A value of \f4\-1\f1 defeats the status.
.TP
\f2login\fP
A string of printable characters that specifies the new login name
of the user.
It may not contain a colon (\f4:\f1) or a newline (\f4\\n\f1).
.TP
\f4\-b \f2base_dir\f1
The default base directory for the system.
If \f4\-d \f2dir\f1 is not specified.
\f2base_dir\f1 is concatenated with the user's login to define
the home directory.
If the \f4-m\f1 option is used,
\f4base_dir\f1 must exist.

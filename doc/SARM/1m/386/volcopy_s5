.SH NAME
\f4volcopy\f1 (s5) \- make a literal copy of an \f4s5\f1 file system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\f4volcopy\f1 [\f4\-F s5\f1] [\f2generic_options\f1] [\f2current_options\f1] \f2fsname srcdevice volname1 
destdevice volname2\f1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I generic_options
are options supported by the generic \f4volcopy\f1 command.
.PP
\f4volcopy\f1
makes a literal copy of the \f4s5\f1 file system
using
a blocksize matched to the device.
.PP
The options are:
.TP 0.50i
\f4\-F s5\f1
Specify the \f4s5\f1-FSType.
.TP 
\&\f(CW\-a\f1
Invoke a verification sequence
requiring a positive operator response instead of the
standard 10-second delay before the copy is made.
.TP
\f4-y\fR
Assume a \f4yes\fR response to all questions.
.P
Other \f2options\f1 are used only with 9-track magnetic tapes:
.TP .75i
\&\f(CW\-bpi\f2density\f1
bits per inch
.TP
\&\f(CW\-feet\f2size\f1
size of reel in feet
.TP .75i
\&\f(CW\-reel\f2num\f1
beginning reel number for a restarted copy 
.TP
\&\f(CW\-buf\f1
use double buffered I/O
.TP
\f4-e\fR
process until the end of tape, then ask for the next tape in
sequence. 
.sp 0.5
.P
If the \f4-e\fP option is not selected, the program
requests length and density
information if this is not given on the
command line, or if it is not recorded on an input tape label.
If the file system is too large to fit on one reel,
\f(CWvolcopy\f1
prompts for additional reels.
Labels of all reels are checked.
Tapes may be mounted alternately on two or more drives.
If \f(CWvolcopy\f1 is interrupted, it asks 
if the user wants to quit 
or escape to the command interpreter.
In the latter case,
the user can perform other operations 
(such as \f(CWlabelit\f1)
and return to \f(CWvolcopy\f1
by exiting the command interpreter.
Note that the \f4-e\fR and \f4-feet\fR options are mutually exclusive.
.PP
The
.I fsname\^
argument represents the mounted name (e.g., \f4root\f1, \f4usr\f1,
etc.) of the file system being copied.
.PP
The
.I srcdevice\^
or \f2destdevice\f1
should be the disk partition or tape (e.g., \f4/dev/rdsk/1s5\f1,
\f4/dev/rmt/c0s0\f1, etc.).
.PP
The
.I volname\^
is the physical volume name.
Such label names contain up to six characters.
.I volname
may be ``\f4\-\f1'' to use the existing volume name.
.PP
.I srcdevice\^
and
.I volname1\^
are the device and volume from which the copy of the file system is
being extracted.
.I destdevice\^
and
.I volname2\^
are the target device and volume.
.PP
.I fsname\^
and
.I volname\^
are recorded in the
superblock.
.SH NOTE
\f4volcopy\f1 does not support tape-to-tape copying.  Use
\f4dd\f1(1M) for tape-to-tape copying.
.SH FILES
.TP 2.0i
\f4/var/adm/filesave.log\f1
a record of file systems/volumes copied

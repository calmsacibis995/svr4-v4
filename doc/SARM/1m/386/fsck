.SH NAME
\f4fsck\f1 \- check and repair file systems 
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4fsck\f1 [\f4\-F\f2 FSType\f1] [\f4\-V\f1] [\f4\-m\f1] [\f2special ...\f1]
.br
\f4fsck\f1 [\f4\-F\f2 FSType\f1] [\f4\-V\f1] [\f2current_options\f1] [\f4\-o\f2 specific_options\f1] [\f2special ...\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4fsck\f1 audits and interactively repairs 
inconsistent conditions for file systems.
If the file system is inconsistent the user is prompted for concurrence
before each correction is attempted.
It should be noted that some corrective actions 
will result in some loss of data.
The amount and severity of data loss may be determined from the 
diagnostic output.  The default action for each correction is to 
wait for the user to respond \f4yes\f1 or \f4no\f1.
If the user does not have write 
permission \f4fsck\f1 defaults to a \f4no\f1 action.
.PP
The file system should be unmounted when \f4fsck\f1 is used.
If this is
not possible, care should be taken that the system is quiescent and that
it is rebooted immediately afterwards
if the file system is a critical one, for example \f4root\fP.
.PP
\f2current_options\f1
are options supported by the \f4s5\f1-specific module of \f4fsck\f1.
Other \f2FSTypes\fP do not necessarily support these options.
\f2specific_options\f1 indicate suboptions specified in a comma-separated 
list of suboptions and/or keyword-attribute pairs for interpretation by 
the \f2FSType\fP-specific module of the command.
.PP
\f2special\f1 represents a block or character special 
device (e.g., \f4/dev/rdsk/c1d0s8\f1).
It is preferable that a character special device be used.
\f4fsck\fP will not work on a block device if it is mounted.
If \f2special\f1 is not supplied, \f4fsck\f1 looks through
\f4/etc/vfstab\f1 and executes \f4fsck\f1 for all character specials
in the \f4fsckdev\fP field of \f4/etc/vfstab\f1
for which there is a numeric entry in the \f4fsckpass\f1 field.
.PP
The options are:
.TP 10 
\f4\-F\f1
Specify the \f2FSType\f1 on which to operate.
The \f2FSType\f1 should either be specified here
or be determinable from \f4/etc/vfstab\f1
by matching the \f2special\f1
with an entry in the table.
If \f2FSType\f1 is not specified, or if \f2FSType\f1
does not exist in \f4/etc/vfstab\f1 then \f2FSType\f1
defaults to s5.
.TP 10 
\f4\-V\f1
Echo the complete command line,
but do not execute the command.
The command line is generated by using
the options and arguments provided by the user
and adding to them information
derived from \f4/etc/vfstab\f1.
This option should be used to
verify and validate the command line.
.TP 10 
\f4\-m\f1
Check but don't repair.
This option checks that the file system
is suitable for mounting.
.TP 10 
\f4\-o\f1
Specify \f2FSType\fP-specific options.
.SH NOTE
This command may not be supported for all \f2FSTypes\fP.

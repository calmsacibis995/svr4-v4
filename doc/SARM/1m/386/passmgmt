.SH NAME
\f4passmgmt\f1 \- password files management
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4passmgmt \-a \f2options name\f1
.br
\f4passmgmt \-m \f2options name\f1
.br
\f4passmgmt \-d \f2name\f1 
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4passmgmt\f1 command updates information in the password files.
This command works with both
\f4/etc/passwd\f1
and
\f4/etc/shadow\f1.
.PP
\f4passmgmt \-a\f1
adds an entry for user \f2name\f1 to the password files.
This command does not create any directory for the new user and the new
login remains locked (with the string \f4*LK*\f1 in the password
field) until the \f4passwd\f1(1)
command is executed to set the password.
.PP
\f4passmgmt \-m\f1
modifies the 
entry for user \f2name\f1 in the password files.
The name field in the \f4/etc/shadow\f1 entry
and all the fields (except the password field) in the \f4/etc/passwd\f1 entry 
can be modified by this command.
Only fields entered on the command line
will be modified.
.PP
\f4passmgmt \-d \f1
deletes the entry for user \f2name\f1 from the password files.
It will not remove any files that
the user owns on the system; they must be removed manually.
.PP
The following options are available:
.TP 12 
\f4\-c \f2comment\f1 
A short description of the login.
It is limited to a maximum
of 128 characters and defaults to an empty field.
.TP 12
\f4\-h \f2homedir\f1 
Home directory of \f2name\f1.
It is limited to a maximum 
of 256 characters and defaults to 
\f4/usr/\f2name\f1.\f1
.TP 12
\f4\-u \f2uid\f1
UID of the \f2name\f1.
This number must range from 0 to the 
maximum non-negative value for the system.
It defaults to
the next available UID greater than 99.
Without the \f4\-o\f1 option, it enforces the uniqueness of a UID.
.TP 12
\f4\-o\f1
This option allows a UID to be non-unique.
It is used only with the \-u option.
.TP 12
\f4\-g \f2gid\f1
GID of the \f2name\f1.
This number must range from 0 to 
the maximum non-negative value for the system.
The default is 1.
.TP 12
\f4\-s \f2shell\f1
Login shell for \f2name\f1.
It should be the full pathname of the 
program that will be executed when the 
user logs in.
The maximum size of \f2shell\f1 is 256 characters. 
The default is for this field to be empty and to be
interpreted as \f4/usr/bin/sh\f1.
.TP 12
\f4\-l \f4logname\fP
This option changes the \f2name\f1 to \f4logname\fP.
It is used only with the \-m option.
.PP
The total size of each login entry
is limited to a
maximum of 511 bytes
in each of the password files.

\-l\f1 is specified).
.SH NOTES
You cannot use a colon or carriage return as part of an argument
because it is interpreted as a field separator
in the password file.

Its functionality has been replaced and enhanced by
\f4useradd\f1, \f4userdel\f1, and \f4usermod\f1.

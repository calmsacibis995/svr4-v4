.SH NAME
\f4rc6\f1 \- run commands performed to stop and reboot the operating system
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/etc/rc6\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
The shell script \f4rc6\f1 is run whenever a transition to run state 6
is requested either through \f4init 6\f1 or \f4shutdown \-i6\f1.
.P
The sequence of events in \f4rc6\f1 is as follows:
.IP \(bu
check to see if a new bootable operating system (\f4/stand/unix\f1)
needs to be built;  if so, build one by running the \f4buildsys\f1
command
.IP \(bu
unmount all file systems
.P
Then \f4init\f1 executes the \f4initdefault\f1
entry in the \f4/etc/inittab\f1 file to bring
the system to the operating state defined by that entry.
.P
Note that if an error occurs while \f4buildsys\f1 is building
a new bootable operating system, a shell is spawned that will exit
only to firmware state;  [see \f4buildsys\f1(1M)].

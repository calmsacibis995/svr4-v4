.SH DESCRIPTION
Without options, the
\f4backup\fP
command performs all backup operations specified for the current day and
week of the backup rotation in the backup register.
This set of backup operations is considered a single job and is assigned a
\f4backup\fP job id
which can be used to control the progress of the session.
As backup operations are processed, their status is tracked
[See
\f4bkstatus\f1(1M)].
As backup operations are completed, they are recorded in the
backup history log.
.P
\f4backup\fP
may only be executed by a user with superuser privilege.
.P
A backup job can be controlled in three ways.
It can be canceled, suspended or resumed
(after being suspended).
.SS Modes of Operator Intervention
Backup operations may require operator
intervention to perform such tasks as
inserting volumes into devices
or confirming proper volume labels.
\f4backup\fP provides three modes of operator
interaction.
.PP
\f4backup\fP
with no options assumes that an operator is present, but
not at the terminal where the \f4backup\fP
command was issued.
This mode sends a \f4mail\f1 message to the operator.
The mail identifies the device requiring service and
the volume required.
The operator reads the mail message,
invokes the \f4bkoper\f1 command, responds to the prompts,
and the backup operation continues.
.PP
\f4backup \-i\f1
establishes interactive mode, which assumes that an
operator is present at the terminal where the \f4backup\fP
command was issued.
In this mode,
\f4bkoper\f1 is automatically invoked at the terminal where
the \f4backup\f1 command was entered.
The operator responds to the prompts as they arrive.
.SS Register Validations
A number of backup service databases must be consistent before
the backups listed in a backup register can be performed.
These consistencies can only be validated at the time
\f4backup\fP is initiated.
If any of them fail,
\f4backup\fP
will terminate.
Invoking \f4backup \-ne\f1 performs the validation checks
in addition to displaying the set of backup operations
to be performed.
The validations are:
.nr IP 0 1
.IP \\n+(IP. 5
The backup method must be a default method or be an executable file
in
\f4/bkup/method\f1 .
.IP \\n+(IP. 5
The dependencies for an entry are all defined
in the register.
Circular dependencies (eg., entry
\f4abc\f1
depends on entry
\f4def;\f1
entry
\f4def\f1
depends on
entry
\f4abc\f1)
are allowed.
.IP \\n+(IP. 5
The device group for a destination must
be defined in
the device group table,
\f4/etc/dgroup.tab\f1
[See
\f2"Device Management" ).\f1
.SS Options
.TP 10
\f4\-c \f2week:day|\f4demand\f1
Selects from the backup register
only those backup operations for the specified week and day of the
backup rotation, instead of the current day and week of the rotation.
If
\f4demand\f1
is specified,
selects only those backup operations scheduled
to be performed on demand.
.TP 10
\f4\-e\f1
This option displays an estimate of the number of volumes
required to perform each backup operation.
.TP 10
\f4\-i\f1
Selects interactive operation
.TP 10
\f4\-j\f2 jobid\f1
Controls only the backup job identified by
.IR jobid .
.I jobid
is a
\f4backup\fP job id.
.TP 10
\f4\-m\f2 user\f1
Sends mail to the named \f2user\f1
when all backup operations for the backup job are complete.
.TP 10
\f4\-n\f1
Displays the set of backup operations that would be performed
but does not actually perform the backup operations.
The display is ordered according to the dependencies and priorities
specified in the backup register.
.TP 10
\f4\-o\f2 name\f1
Initiates backup operations only on the named originating object.
\f2name\f1 is an item in the following form:
      \f2oname|odevice\f1
.TP 10
\f4\-s\f1
Displays a "." for each 100 (512-byte) blocks transferred to the destination
device.  The dots are displayed
while each backup operation is progressing.
.TP 10
\f4\-t\f2 table\f1
Initiates backup operations described in the specified backup
register instead of the default register,
\f4etc/bkup/bkreg.tab\f1 .
\f2table\f1
is a backup register.
.TP 10
\f4\-u\f2 user\f1
Controls backup jobs started by the named
.I user
instead of those started by the user invoking the command.
.I user
is a valid login id.
.TP 10
\f4\-v\f1
While each backup operation is progressing,
display the name of each file or directory
as soon as it has
been transferred to the destination device.
.TP 10
\f4\-A\f1
Controls backup jobs for all users instead of those
started by the user invoking the command.
.TP 10
\f4\-C\f1
Cancels backup jobs.
.TP 10
\f4\-R\f1
Resumes suspended backup jobs.
.TP 10
\f4\-S\f1
Suspends backup jobs.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The exit codes for the \f4backup\fP command are the following:
.PP
\f40\f1 = successful completion of the task
.br
\f41\f1 = one or more parameters to \f4backup\fP are invalid.
.br
\f42\f1 = an error has occurred which caused \f4backup\fP to fail to
      complete \f2all\f1 portions of its task.
.SH EXAMPLES
Example 1:
.P
.in 1.0i
\f4backup -i -v -c 2:1 -m admin3\fP
.in 0
.P
initiates those backups scheduled for Monday of the
second week in the rotation period instead of backups
for the current day and week. 
Performs the backup
in interactive mode and displays on standard output the
name of each file, directory, file system partition, or
data partition as soon as it is transferred to the
destination device. 
When all backups are completed, sends
mail notification to the user with login id \f4admin3\f1.
.sp
Example 2:
.P
.in 1.0i
\f4backup \-o/usr:/dev/rdsk/0s2:usr\fP
.in 0
.P
initiates only those backups from the \f2usr\f1 file
system that is mounted on
the originating device
\f4/dev/rdsk/0s2\f1
and is labeled
\f4usr\f1.
.sp
Example 3:
.P
.in 1.0i
\f4backup \-S\f1
.in 0
.P
Suspends the backup jobs requested by the invoking user.
.sp
Example 4:
.P
.in 1.0i
\f4backup \-R \-j back-359\f1
.in 0
.P
resumes the backup operations included in backup job id
\f4back-359\f1.

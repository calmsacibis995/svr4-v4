.SH NAME
\f4rc2\f1 \- run commands performed for multi-user environment
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/etc/rc2\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
This file is executed via an entry in
\f4/etc/inittab\f1
and is responsible for those initializations
that bring the system to a ready-to-use state,
traditionally state \f42\f1, called the "multi-user" state.
.PP
The actions performed by
\f4rc2\f1
are found in files in the directory
\f4/etc/rc.d\f1
and files beginning with \f4S\f1 in \f4/etc/rc2.d\f1.
These files are executed by
\f4/usr/bin/sh\f1
in ASCII sort\-sequence order (see FILES for more information).
When functions are added that need to be initialized when the
system goes multi-user, an appropriate file should be added in
\f4/etc/rc2.d\f1.
.PP
The functions done by
the \f4rc2\f1
command and associated
\f4/etc/rc2.d\f1
files include:
.RS
.sp .5
Setting and exporting the \f4TIMEZONE\f1 variable.
.sp .5
Setting-up and mounting the user (\f4/usr\f1) file system.
.sp .5
Cleaning up (remaking) the
\f4/tmp\f1
and
\f4/var/tmp\f1
directories.
.sp .5
Loading the network interface and ports cards with program
data and starting the associated processes.
.sp .5
Starting the
\f4cron\fP
daemon by executing
\f4/usr/etc/cron\f1.
.sp .5
Cleaning up (deleting) \f4uucp\f1 locks 
status, and temporary files in the
\f4/var/spool/uucp\f1
directory.
.RE
.PP
Other functions can be added, as required, to support the
addition of hardware and software features.
.SH EXAMPLES
The following are prototypical files found in
\f4/etc/rc2.d\f1.
These files are prefixed by an
\f4S\f1
and a number indicating the execution order
of the files.

.PP
The file
\f4/etc/TIMEZONE\f1
is included early in
\f4rc2\f1,
thus establishing the default time zone for all commands that follow.
.SH FILES
Here are some hints about files in 
\f4/etc/rc.d\f1:
.PP
The order in which files are executed is important.
Since they are executed in ASCII sort\-sequence order,
using the first character of the file name as a sequence
indicator will help keep the proper order.
Thus, files starting with the following characters would be:
.RS
.sp .5
.nf
[\f40-9\f1].~~~~very early
[\f4A-Z\f1].~~~~early
[\f4a-n\f1].~~~~later
[o-z].~~~~last
.sp .5
3.mountfs
.fi
.RE
.PP
Files in
\f4/etc/rc.d\f1
that begin with a dot (\f4.\f1)
will not be executed.
This feature can be used to hide files that are
not to be executed for the time being without removing them.
The command can be used only by the super-user.
.PP
Files in
\f4/etc/rc2.d\f1
must begin with an
\f4S\f1
or a
\f4K\f1
followed by a number and the rest of the file name.
Upon entering run level 2,
files beginning with
\f4S\f1
are executed with the
\f4start \f1
option; files beginning with
\f4K\f1,
are executed with the
\f4stop\f1
option.
Files beginning with other characters are ignored.

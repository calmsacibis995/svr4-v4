.SH NAME
\f4diskadd\f1 \- disk set up utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4diskadd\f1
[\f2disk_number\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The initial system disk is set up during system installation.
Additional disks must be set up using \f4diskadd\f1.
\f4diskadd\f1 is an interactive command which prompts the user for
information about the setup of the disk.
.PP
The optional argument \f2disk_number\fP is used to represent the SCSI disk device
to be added to the system.
If no argument or a 1 is supplied, \f4diskadd\f1 will be executed for the 
second integral disk.
The format of the \f2disk_number\fP argument is:
.sp .5
.ti .5i
	\f4c\f2x\f4t\f2y\f4d\f2z
.TS
center, tab(;);
fBl n.
\f2x\f1 \0=;\& controller number, (0 - 2)
\f2y\f1 \0=;\& Target controller SCSI ID, (0 - 6)
\f2z\f1 \0=;\& Logical Unit ID number, (0 - 3).
.TE
.PP
The tasks which are required for the setup of disks include the following
steps.
First the \f4fdisk\f1(1M) command is invoked to partition the disk. 
This step breaks up the disk into logical portions for the UNIX 
Operating system and for the DOS Operating system.
The \f4disksetup\f1(1M) command is invoked next for surface analysis,
creating/writing the \f4pdinfo\fP, VTOC and alternates info (for non-SCSI drives)
to the disk, issuing the needed \f4mkfs\fP calls, and mounting filesystems.
The surface analysis is done to catch any detectable defects and
remap them.
On SCSI disks, the formatting of the disk will remap any detectable defects,
so the surface analysis is optional, but recommended.
The creation of the VTOC divides the UNIX system partition into slices.
Slices are created to contain a filesystem or act as a raw device (e.g.,
the \f4swap\fP or \f4dump\fP device).
The execution of the \f4mkfs\f1(1M) command for the needed filesystems handles
the creation of a specific type of filesystem on a slice.
If automatic mounting was requested,
directories are created in the root filesystem to hold the new filesystems,
they are mounted, and \f4/etc/vfstab\f1 is updated to remount them on subsequent
bootups of the system.
.PP
The device files will be present prior to running \f4diskadd\f1.
The device files for an second integral disk 
\f4/dev/rdsk/1s*\f1 and \f4/dev/dsk/1s*\f1,
are always present.
.\" The device files for any additional SCSI disk 
.\" \f4/dev/rdsk/c*t*d*s*\f1 and \f4/dev/dsk/c*t*d*s*\f1,
.\" will be created by \f4scsimkdev\f1(1M).
.PP
If swap/paging space is added on the new drive, it must be made available for
system use with the
\f4swap\f1(1M)
program.
.SH NOTES
Due to compatibility considerations, when you set-up a UFS filesystem
greater than 128 MB, it will hold only 64k inodes.
To create more than 64k inodes, either recreate the filesystem using \f4mkfs\fP
or use the UFS filesystem debugger to allocate more inodes.

.SH NAME
\f4xrestore, xrestor\f1 \- invoke XENIX incremental filesystem restorer
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4xrestore\f1
.I key 
[ 
.I arguments 
]
.sp
\f4xrestor\f1
.I key 
[ 
.I arguments 
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4xrestore\f1
is used to read archive media backed up with the XENIX 
\f4backup\fR(C)\f1
command.
The
.I key\^
specifies what is to be done.
.I Key\^
is one of the characters
.BR rRxt ,
optionally combined with
.BR f .
\f4xrestor\f1
is an alternate spelling for the same command.
.TP 8
.B  f
Uses the first
.I argument\^
as the name of the archive instead of the default.
.TP
\f4F\f1 \f2num\f1
Specifies the file number of the first volume to be
restored.
.TP
\f4k\f1 \f2vsize\f1
Specifies the size of the volume to be restored.
.TP
\f4r\f1 , \f4R\f1  
The archive is read and loaded into the filesystem
specified in
.IR argument .
This should not be done lightly (see below).
If the 
.I key 
is
\f4R\f1 ,
\f4xrestore\f1
asks which archive of a multi\&volume set to start on.
This allows
\f4xrestore\f1
to be interrupted and then
restarted (an
\f4fsck\f1
must be done before the restart).
.TP
.B  x
Each file on the archive named by an 
.I argument\^
is extracted.
The filename has all ``mount'' prefixes removed;
for example, if
\f4/usr\f1
is a mounted filesystem,
\f4/usr/bin/lpr\f1
is named
\f4/bin/lpr\f1
on the archive.
The extracted file is placed in a file with a numeric name supplied by
\f4xrestore\f1
(actually the inode number).
In order to keep the amount of archive read to a minimum,
the following procedure is recommended:
.RS
.TP 4
1.
Mount volume 1 of the set of backup archives.
.TP
2.
Type the
\f4xrestore\f1
command.
.TP
3.
\f4r1restore\f1
will announce whether or not it found the files,
give the numeric name that it will assign to the file, 
and in the case of a tape, rewind to the start of the archive.
.TP
4.
It then asks you to ``mount the desired tape volume''.
Type the number of the volume you choose.
On a multivolume backup the recommended procedure is to mount the
volumes, last through first.
\f4restore\f1
checks to see if any of the requested files are on the
mounted archive (or a later archive\-thus the reverse order). 
If the requested files are not there, \f4xrestore\f1
doesn't read through the tape.
If you are working with a single-volume backup 
or if the number of files
being restored is large, respond to the query with
1 ,
and
\f4xrestore\f1
will read the archives in sequential order.
.RE
.TP
\f4X\f1 \f2files\f1
Puts files in the directory specified by
.IR arguments .
.TP
\f4t\f1
Prints the date the archive was written and the date
the filesystem was backed up.
.TP
\f4T\f1
This causes 
\f4xrestore\f1
to behave like
\f4dumpdir\f1 (C)
except that it doesn't list directories.
.PP
The
\f4r\f1
option should only be used to restore
a complete backup archive onto a clear filesystem,
or to restore an incremental backup archive onto
a filesystem so created.
Thus:
.PP
	\f4/etc/mkfs\ \|/dev/dsk/0s3\ \|10000\f1
.br
	\f4xrestore\ \|r\ \|/dev/dsk/0s3\f1
.PP
is a typical sequence to restore a complete backup.
Another
\f4xrestore\f1
can be done to get an incremental backup in on top of this.
.PP
A
\f4backup\f1
followed by a
\f4mkfs\f1
and a
\f4xrestore\f1
is used to
change the size of a filesystem.
.SH FILES
.TP 23
\f4rst*\f1
Temporary files
.TP
\f4/etc/default/xrestore\f1
Name of default archive device
.PP
The default archive unit varies with installation.
.SH NOTES
\f4xrestore\f1
is for XENIX compatibility and should only be used to restore filesystems
that were backed up under XENIX.
.P
It is not possible to successfully 
restore an entire active 
\f4root\f1 
filesystem. 
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
There are various diagnostics
involved with reading the archive and writing the disk.
There are also diagnostics if the i-list or the free list
of the filesystem is not large enough to hold the dump.
.PP
If the dump extends over more than one disk or tape,
it may ask you to change disks or tapes.
Reply with a 
.SM NEWLINE
when the next unit has been mounted.

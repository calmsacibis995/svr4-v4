.SH NAME
\f4sysadm\f1 \- visual interface to perform system administration
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\f4sysadm\f1 [ \f2menu name\f1 | \f2task name\f1 ]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This command, when invoked without an argument, 
presents a set of menus that help 
you do administrative work.
If you specify a menu or task on the command line,
one of two things happens:
if the requested menu or task is unique, it is 
immediately displayed;
if the menu or task is not unique, 
a menu of choices is displayed.
.P
The \f4sysadm\fP command may be given a password.
To assign a password,
use the \f4password\f1 task 
under the \f4system_setup\f1 menu.
To change a password after it is assigned,
use the \f4password\f1 command.
.P
When you invoke \f4sysadm\fP on
a computer running UNIX System V Release 4,
the main menu (a collection of twelve menus)
appears as follows:
.PP

called \f4Administration for Available 
Applications\fP (or \f4applications\fP)
under which those packages are found.
.P
All menu items for 
pre-Release 4 optional add-on packages
other than those listed on the main menu
under \f4packagmgmt\f1
now appear under \f4old_sysadm\f1 on the main menu.
(The entry \f4old_sysadm\f1 will appear

.SH NAME
\f4mapchan\f1 \- Configure tty device mapping.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4mapchan\f1 [-\f4ans\f1] [-\f4f\f1 \f2mapfile\f1] [\f2channels . . .\f1]
.br
\f4mapchan\f1 [-\f4o\f1] [-\f4d\f1] [\f2channel\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f4mapchan\f1 configures the mapping of information input and output of the
UNIX system.
The \f4mapchan\f1 utility is intended for users of applications
that employ languages other than English (character sets other than 7 bit ASCII).
.P
\f4mapchan\f1 translates codes sent by peripheral devices, such as terminals,
to the internal character set used by the UNIX system.
\f4mapchan\f1 can also
map codes in the internal character set to other codes
for output to peripheral devices (such as terminals, printers,
console screen, etc.).
Note that PC keyboard configuration is accomplished through the
\f4mapkey\f1(1) utility.
.P
\f4mapchan\f1 has several uses:
to map a \f2channel\f1 (-\f4a\f1 or -\f4s\f1);
to unmap a \f2channel\fP (\-\f4n\f1 and optionally -\f4a\f1);
or to display the map
on a \f2channel\fP (optionally -\f4o\f1,-\f4d\f1, \f2channels\f1).
.P
\f4mapchan\f1 with no options displays the map on the user's \f2channel\f1.
The map displayed is suitable as input for \f4mapchan\f1.
.sp 0.25
The  options are :
.br
.IP "\f4-a\f1"
When used alone, sets all \f2channels\f1 given in the default file
(\f4/etc/default/mapchan\f1) with the specified map.
When used with \f4-n\f1, it refers to all \f2channels\f1
given in the default file.
Superuser maps or unmaps all \f2channels\f1,
other users map only \f2channels\f1 they own.
The \f4-a\f1 option can not be used with the \f4-d\f1, \f4-o\f1, or \f4-s\f1
options.
.IP "\f4-d\f1"
Causes the mapping table currently in use on the given device, \f2channel\f1,
to be displayed in decimal instead of the default hexadecimal.
An ASCII version is displayed on standard output.
This output is suitable as an input
file to \f4mapchan\f1 for another \f2channel\f1.
Mapped values are displayed.
Identical pairs are not output.
The \f4-d\f1 option can not be used with \f4-a\f1, \f4-f\f1, \f4-n\f1,
\f4-o\f1 or \f4-s\f1 options.
.IP "\f4-f\f1"
Causes the current \f2channel\f1 or list of channels to be mapped with 
\f2mapfile\f1.
The \f4-f\f1 option can not be used with \f4-d\f1, \f4-n\f1, \f4-s\f1, or
\f4-o\f1 options.
.IP "\f4-n\f1"
Causes null mapping to be performed.
All codes are input and output as received.
Mapping is turned off for the user's \f2channel\f1 or for other \f2channels\f1,
if given.
\f4-a\f1 used with \f4-n\f1 will turn mapping off for all \f2channels\f1
given in the default file.
This is the default mapping for all \f2channels\f1
unless otherwise configured.
The \f4-n\f1 option can not be used with \f4-d\f1, \f4-f\f1,
\f4-o\f1, or \f4-s\f1 options.
.IP "\f4-o\f1"
Causes the mapping table currently in use on the given device, \f2channel\f1,
to be displayed in octal instead of the default hexadecimal.
An ASCII version is displayed on standard output. 
This output is suitable as an input file to \f4mapchan\f1 for another port.
Mapped values are displayed.
Identical pairs are not output.
The \f4-o\f1 option can not be used with \f4-a\f1,
\f4-d\f1, \f4-f\f1, \f4-n\f1, or \f4-s\f1 options.
.IP "\f4-s\f1"
Sets the user's current \f2channel\f1 with the \f2mapfile\f1 given in the 
default file.
The \f4-s\f1 option can not be used with any other option.
.P
The user must own the \f2channel\f1 in order to map it.
The super-user can map any channel.
Read or write permission is required to display the map on a \f2channel\f1.
.P
Each tty device \f2channel\f1 (display adapter and video monitor on computer,
parallel port, serial port, etc.) can have a different map.
When the UNIX system boots, mapping is off for all \f2channels\f1.
.P
\f4mapchan\f1 is usually invoked in the \f4/etc/rc2\f1 file.
This file is
executed when the system enters the multiuser mode and sets up the default
mapping for the system.
Users can invoke \f4mapchan\f1 when they log in 
by including a \f4mapchan\f1 command line in their \f4.profile\f1 or
\f4.login\f1 file.
In addition, users can remap their \f2channel\f1 at
any time by invoking \f4mapchan\f1 from the command line.
\f2channels\f1 not listed in the default file are not automatically mapped.
\f2channels\f1 are not changed on logout.
Whatever mapping was in place for the last user
remains in effect for the next user, unless they modify their \f4.profile\f1
or \f4.login\f1 file.
.P
For example, the default file \f4/etc/default/mapchan\f1 can obtain:
.TS
center;
l l.
tty1
tty2	ibm
tty3	wy60.ger
lp	ibm
.TE
The default directory containing \f2mapfiles\f1 is \f4/usr/lib/mapchan\f1.
The default directory containing \f2channel\f1 files is \f4/dev\f1.
Full pathnames may be used for \f2channels\f1 or \f2mapfiles\f1.
If a \f2channel\f1 has no entry, or the entry field is blank,
no mapping is enabled on that \f2channel\f1.
Additional \f2channels\f1 added to the system (for example, adding
a serial or parallel port), are not automatically entered in the \f4mapchan\f1
default file.
If mapping is required, the system administrator must make the entries.
The format of the \f2mapfiles\f1 is documented in the \f4mapchan\f1(4)
manual page.
.SH Using a Mapped channel
The input information is assumed to be 7-or 8-bit codes sent by the peripheral
device.
The device may make use of dead or compose keys to produce the codes.
If the device does not have dead or compose keys, these keys
can be simulated using \f4mapchan\f1.
.P
One to one mapped characters are displayed when the key is pressed and the 
mapped value is passed to the kernel.
.P
Certain keys are designated as dead keys in the \f2mapfile\f1.
Dead key sequences are two keystrokes that produce a single mapped value that is
passed to the kernel.
The dead key is usually a diacritical character, the
second key is usually the letter being modified.
For example, the sequence \f4'e\f1 could be mapped to the ASCII value 0xE9,
and displayed as \f4e'\f1.
.P
One key is designated as the compose key in the \f2mapfile\f1.
Compose key sequences are composed of three keystrokes that produce a single
mapped value that is passed to the kernel.
The compose key is usually a seldom used character or CTRL-\f2letter\f1
combination.
The second key is usually the letter being modified.
The third key may be another character being combined, or a
diacritical character.
For example, if \f4@\fP is the 
compose key, the sequence \f4 @ c O\f1 could be mapped to the ASCII value
0xA9, and displayed as \f4\(co\f1.
.P
Characters are not echoed to the screen during a dead or compose sequence.
The mapped character is echoed and passed to the kernel once the sequence
is correctly completed.
.P
Characters are always put through the input map, even when part of dead
or compose sequences.
The character is then checked for the internal value.
The value may also be mapped on output.
This should be kept mind when preparing map files.
.P
The following conditions will cause an error during input:
.TP
1)
non-recognized (not defined in the \f2mapfile\f1) dead or compose sequence.
.TP
2)
restarting a compose sequence before completion by pressing the compose 
key in the middle of a dead or compose sequence (this is an error, but
a new compose sequence is initiated).
.P
If the \f2mapfile\f1 contains the keyword \f4beep\f1, a bell sounds when
either of the above conditions occurs.
In either case, the characters are
not echoed to the screen, or passed to the kernel.
.P
In order to allow for character sequences sent to control the terminal
(move the cursor, and so on) rather than to print characters on the
screen, \f4mapchan\f1 allows characters sequences to be specified as
special sequences which are not passed through the normal mapping
procedure.
Two sections may be specified, one for each of the input
(keyboard) and output (screen) controls.
.SH "Character Sets"
.P
The internal character set used is defined by the \f2mapfiles\f1 used.
By default, this is the ISO 8859/1 character set which is also known
as dpANS X3.4.2 and ISO/TC97/SC2.
It supports most of the Latin
alphabet and can represent most European languages.
.P
Several partial map files are provided as examples.
They must be modified for use with specific peripheral devices.
Consult your hardware manual for the codes needed to display
the desired characters.
Two map files are provided for use with the console device:
\f4/usr/lib/mapchan/ibm\fP for systems with a standard PC
character set ROM, and \f4/usr/lib/mapchan/iso\fP
for systems with an optional ISO 8859/1 character set ROM.
.P
Care should be taken that the \f4stty\f1 settings [see \f4stty\fP(1M)]
are correct for 8-bit terminals.
The \f4/etc/gettydefs\f1 file may require modifications
to allow logging with the correct settings.
.P
7-bit U.S ASCII (ANSI X3.4) should be used if no mapping is enabled
on the \f2channel\f1.

.SH NOTES
Some non-U.S keyboards and display devices do not support characters
commonly used by command shells and the C programming language.
It is not recommended that these devices be used for system administration
tasks.
.P
Printers can be mapped, output only,
and can either be sent 8-bit codes
or one-to-many character strings using \f4mapchan\fP.
Line printer spooler interface scripts can be used
(\f4setuid root\fP)
to change the output map on the printer when different maps
are required (as in changing print wheels to display a
different character set).
See \f4lpadmin\fP(1M)
and
\f4lp\fP(7)
for information on installing and administering interface scripts.
.P
Not all terminals or printers can display all the
characters that can be represented using this utility.
Refer to the device's hardware manual for information on the
capabilities of the peripheral device.
.P
Use of \f2mapfiles\f1 that specify a different internal character set
per channel, or a set other than the 8-bit ISO 8859 set supplied by default
can cause strange side effects.
It is especially important to retain the
7-bit ASCII portion of the character set [see \f4ascii\f1(5)].
System utilities and many applications assume these values.
.P
Media transported between machines with different internal code set mappings
may not be portable as no mapping is performed on block devices, such
as tape and floppy drives.
However, \f4trchan\f1 with an appropriate 
\f2mapfile\f1 can be used to translate from one internal character set
to another.
.P
Do not set \f4ISTRIP\fP [see \f4stty\f1(1)] when using \f4mapchan\f1.
This option causes the eighth bit to be stripped before mapping occurs.

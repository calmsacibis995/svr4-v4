.SH DESCRIPTION
.I generic_options
are options supported by the generic \f4mkfs\f1 command.
.PP
\f4mkfs\f1
constructs a file system by writing on the special file
.I special
unless the
\f1`\f4\-o N\f1'
flag has been specified.
The numeric
.I size
specifies the number of sectors in the file system.
\f4mkfs\f1
builds a file system with a root directory and a
\f4lost+found\f1
directory [see
\f4fsck\f1(1M)].
The number of inodes is calculated as a
function of the file system size.
.P
The options are:
.PP
.TP
\f4\-F ufs\f1
Specifies the \f4ufs\f1-FSType.
.TP
\f4\-o \f1
Specify
\f4ufs\f1
file system specific options. 
The following options are available:
.RS
.TP
\f4N\f1
Do not write the file system to the
.I special
file.
This suboption gives all the information
needed to create a file system but does
not create it.
.TP
\f4nsect=\f2n\f1
The number of sectors per track on the disk.
The default is
\f418\f1.
.TP
\f4ntrack=\f2n\f1
The number of tracks per cylinder on the disk.
The default is
\f49\f1.
.TP
\f4bsize=\f2n\f1
The primary block size for files on the file system.
It must be a power of two, currently selected from
\f44096\f1
(the default)
or
\f48192\f1.
.TP
\f4fragsize=\f2n\f1
The fragment size for files on the file system.
The
\f4fragsize\f1
represents the smallest amount of disk
space that will be allocated to a file.
It must be a power of two currently selected from the range
\f4512\f1
to
\f48192\f1.
The default is
\f41024\f1.
.TP
\f4cgsize=\f2n\f1
The number of disk cylinders per cylinder group.
This number must be in the range
\f41\f1
to
\f432\f1.
The default is
\f416\f1.
.TP
\f4free=\f2n\f1
The minimum percentage of free disk space allowed.
Once the file system capacity reaches this threshold, only
a privileged user is allowed to allocate disk blocks.
The default value is 
\f410%\f1.
.TP
\f4rps=\f2n\f1
The rotational speed of the disk, in revolutions per second.
The default is
\f460\f1.
.TP
\f4nbpi=\f2n\f1
The number of bytes for which one inode block is allocated.
This parameter is
currently set at one inode block for every 2048 bytes.
.TP
\f4opt=s|t\f1
Space or time optimization preference;
\f4s\f1
specifies optimization for space,
\f4t\f1
specifies optimization for time.
The default is
\f4t\f1.
.TP
\f4apc=\f2n\f1
The number of alternates per cylinder (\s-1SCSI\s0 devices only). 
The default is
\f40\f1.
.TP
\f4gap=\f2n\f1
The expected time (in milliseconds)
to service a transfer completion
interrupt and initiate a new transfer on the same disk.
It is used to decide how much rotational spacing to place between
successive blocks in a file.
The default is 4.
.RE
.SH NOTES
The value of the \f4nbpi\fP operand in the output of
\f4mkfs -m\fP is always 2048, even if the file system was
created with some other value.

.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4mknod\fP
makes a directory entry for a special file.
.PP
In the first case, \f2name\fP is the special file to be created. The 
second argument is either \f4b\fP to indicate a block-type special file or 
\f4c\fP to indicate a character-type.
The last two arguments are
numbers specifying the
.I major\^
and 
.I minor\^
device numbers;
these may be either decimal or octal [see \f4mknod(2)\fP in the \f2Programmer's
Reference Manual\fP for information on minor device number values].
The assignment of major device numbers is specific to each system.
You must be the super-user to use this form of the command.
.PP
The second case is used to create a FIFO (named pipe).
.SH "NOTES"
If \f4mknod\f1 is used to create a device in a remote directory
(Remote File Sharing), the major and minor device numbers
are interpreted by the server.
.SH "SEE ALSO"

\f2Programmer's Reference Manual\f1.

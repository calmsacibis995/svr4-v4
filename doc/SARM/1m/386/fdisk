.SH NAME
\f4fdisk\f1 \- create or modify hard disk partition table
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4fdisk\f1
[\|\f2argument\f1\|]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This command is used to create and modify the partition
table that is put in the first sector of the hard disk.
This table is used by DOS and by the
first-stage bootstrap to identify parts of the disk
reserved for different operating systems,
and to identify the partition containing the second-stage
bootstrap (the active partition). 
The optional argument can be used to specify the raw device
associated with the hard disk; the default value is
\f4/dev/rdsk/0s0\f1
for integral disks.
For SCSI disks,
there is no default value.
However if the default on your system is set to \f40s0\f1,
then it is linked to \f4/dev/rdsk/c0t0d0s0\f1.
If the default is set to \f41s0\f1,
then it is linked to \f4/dev/rdsk/c0t1d0s0\f1.
.PP
The program displays the partition table as it exists on the disk,
and then presents a menu allowing the user to modify the table.
The menu, questions, warnings,
and error messages are intended to be self-explanatory.
.PP
If there is no partition table on the disk,
the user is given the option of creating a
default partitioning or specifying the initial table values.
The default partitioning allows
10% of the disk for MS-DOS and 90%
for the UNIX System, and makes the UNIX System partition active.
In either case, when the initial table is created,
\f4fdisk\f1
also writes out the first-stage bootstrap code [see
\f4hd\f1(7)]
along with the partition table.
After the initial table is created, only the table is changed;
the bootstrap is not modified.
.SS Menu Options
.PP
The following are the menu options given by the
\f4fdisk\f1
program:
.TP .5i
\f4Create a partition\f1
This option allows the user to create a new partition.
The maximum number of partitions is 4.
The program will ask for the type of the partition
(MS-DOS, UNIX System, or other).
It will then ask for the size of the partition
as a percentage of the disk.
The user may also enter the letter \f4c\f1 at this point,
in which case the program will ask for the starting cylinder number
and size of the partition in cylinders.
If a \f4c\f1 is not entered,
the program will determine the starting cylinder number
where the partition will fit.
In either case, if the partition would overlap an existing partition,
or will not fit,
a message is displayed and the program returns to the original menu.
.TP .5i
\f4Change Active (Boot from) partition\f1
This option allows the user to specify the partition where the
first-stage bootstrap will look for the second-stage bootstrap,
otherwise known as the active partition.
.TP .5i
\f4Delete a partition\f1
This option allows the user to delete a previously created partition.
Note that this will destroy all data in that partition.
.TP .5i
\f4Exit\f1
This option writes the new version of the table created during
this session with
\f4fdisk\f1
out to the hard disk, and exits the program.
.TP .5i
\f4Cancel\f1
This option exits without modifying the partition table.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Most messages will be self-explanatory.
The following may appear
immediately after starting the program:
.TP
\f4fdisk: cannot open <device>\f1
This indicates that the device name argument is not valid.
.TP
\f4fdisk: unable to get device parameters for device <device>\f1
This indicates a problem with the configuration of the hard disk,
or an error in the hard disk driver.
.TP
\f4fdisk: error reading partition table\f1
This indicates that some error occurred when trying initially
to read the hard disk.
This could be a problem with the hard disk controller or driver,
or with the configuration of the hard disk.
.PP
This message may appear after selecting the
\f4Exit\f1
option from the menu.
.TP
\f4fdisk: error writing boot record\f1
This indicates that some error occurred when trying to
write the new partition table out to the hard disk. 
This could be a problem with the hard
disk controller, the disk itself, the driver,
or the configuration of the hard disk.
.SH FILES
\f4/dev/rdsk/0s0\f1 for integral disks
.br
\f4/dev/rdsk/c\f2?\f4t\f2?\f4d\f2?\f4s0\f1 for SCSI disks
.SH "SEE ALSO"
\f4mkpart\f1(1M), \f4disk\f1(7), \f4hd\f1(7).
.SH NOTES 
Compatible with MS-DOS Versions 3.2, 3.3, and 4.0.
Partitions set up using the MS-DOS 4.0 \f4fdisk\f1
command that are greater than 32 MB will appear
in the UNIX System display as "other".
Partitions created with MS-DOS that are
less than 32 MB will appear correctly
as DOS partitions.
.P 
The DOS 4.01 \f4fdisk\f1 program assumes it can store
diagnostic information in cylinder 1020 on the hard disk.
If a UNIX System partition is created that uses
cylinder 1020,
DOS 4.01 \f4fdisk\f1 will be unable to create a 
DOS partition.
Therefore, the user must either create the UNIX System
partition at the front of the disk so that
cylinder 1020 is not used,
or create the DOS partition using the
UNIX System \f4fdisk\f1 (not DOS \f4fdisk\f1)
and never delete it.
.P
When setting up a DOS 4.01 partition on the
hard disk to co-reside with a UNIX partition
that has already been set up, DO NOT allow
\f4fdisk\f1 to create the largest possible
partition and make it active (as the \f4fdisk\f1
prompt requests).
Instead, the user should manually set it up
to line up against the UNIX partition.
Note that this applies to when the user
boots DOS 4.01 from floppy disk 
(not from within UNIX) and runs \f4fdisk\f1.

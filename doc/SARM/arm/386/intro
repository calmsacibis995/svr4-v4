This \f2System Administrator's Reference Manual\f1 describes the commands,
file formats, and miscellaneous facilities used by those who administer
a \s-1UNIX\s0 System V/386 system.
.P
Several closely-related documents contain other
valuable information:
.BL
.LI
The \f2System Administrator's Guide\f1
provides procedures for and
explanations of administrative tasks.
.LI
The \f2User's Guide\f1 presents an overview
of the \s-1UNIX\s0 system and tutorials on how
to use text editors,
automate repetitive jobs, and send
information to others.
.LI
The \f2User's Reference Manual\f1 describes the commands
that constitute the basic software
running on system.
.LI
The \f2Programmer's Guide\f1 presents an
overview of the \s-1UNIX\s0 system programming environment
and tutorials on various programming tools.
.LI
The \f2Programmer's Reference Manual\f1
describes the commands, system calls,
subroutines, libraries, file formats, and miscellaneous facilities
used by programmers.
.LE
.P
The \f2System Administrator's Reference Manual\f1 is divided into
five sections:
.VL .85i .45i
.LI (1M)
System Maintenance Commands and Application Programs
.LI (4)
File Formats
.LI (5)
Miscellaneous Facilities
.LI (7)
Special Files
.LI (8)
System Maintenance Procedures
.LE
.ta .5i 1i 1.5i 2i 2.5i 3i 3.5i 4i 4.5i 5i 5.5i 6i 6.5i
.P
Throughout this manual,
numbers following a command are intended for easy cross-reference.
A command with a (1M), (7), or (8)
following it means that the command is in the corresponding section
of this manual.
A command with a
(4) or (5)
following it means that the command is in the corresponding section of
this manual and the
\f2Programmer's Reference Manual\fP.
A command followed by a (1), (1C), or (1G)
usually means that it is found in the \f2User's Reference Manual\fP.
(Section 1 commands appropriate for use by programmers
are located in the \f2Programmer's Reference Manual\f1.)
A command with a
(2) or (3)
following it means that the command is in the corresponding section of the
\f2Programmer's Reference Manual\fP.
.P
Section~1M, "System Maintenance Commands and Application Programs,"
contains commands and programs that are used in administering a 
\s-1UNIX\s+1 system.
.P
Section~4,
"File Formats,"
documents the structure of particular
kinds of files.
For example, the format of \f4/etc/passwd\fP is given
on \f4passwd\fP(4)
and the content of \f4/etc/profile\fP is explained
on \f4profile\fP(4).
In general, when a C language structure
corresponds to a file format,
it can be found in either the \f4/usr/include\fP
or \f4/usr/include/sys\fP directories.
.P
Section~5, "Miscellaneous Facilities," contains a variety of information.
For example, a table of the octal and hexadecimal equivalents of the
\s-1ASCII\s0 character set is given on \f4ascii\fP(5),
shell environmental variables
(such as \f4\s-1HOME\s0\fP, \f4\s-1PATH\s0\fP, \f4\s-1LANGUAGE\s0\fP, etc.)
are described on \f4environ\fP(5), and
names of common \s-1AT&T\s0 terminals are listed on \f4term\fP(5).
.P
Section~7,
"Special Files," discusses the characteristics of
system files that refer to input/output devices.
The names in this
section generally refer to
device names for the hardware, rather than to the names of
the special files themselves.
.P
Section~8, "System Maintenance Procedures," discusses
crash recovery, firmware programs, boot procedures, 
facility descriptions, etc.
.P
Each section begins with a page labeled \f4intro\f1.
Entries following the \f4intro\f1 page are arranged
alphabetically and may consist of more than one page.
Some entries describe several routines, commands, etc.
In such cases, the entry appears only once, alphabetized under
its "primary" name. 
(An example of such an entry is \f4mount\f1(1M), which also describes
the \f4umount\f1 command.)
The "secondary" commands are listed directly below their associated primary
command.
To learn which manual page describes a secondary command,
locate its name in the middle column of the "Permuted Index"
and follow across that line to the name of the manual page listed in the right column.
.P
All entries are based on a common format,
not all of whose parts always appear:
.BL
.LI
\f3\s-1NAME\s+1\f1
gives the name(s) of the entry and
briefly
states its purpose.
.LI
\f3\s-1SYNOPSIS\s+1\f1
summarizes the use of the
program being described.
A few conventions are used, particularly in
Section~1M
(\f2Commands\^\f1):
.BL
.LI
\f4Constant Width\f1
strings are literals and
are to be typed just as they appear.
.LI
\f2Italic\^\f1 strings usually represent
substitutable argument
and program names found elsewhere in the manual.
(They are
underlined
in
the typed version of the entries.)
.LI
Square brackets \f3[\|]\f1 around an argument
indicate that the argument is optional.
When an argument is given as
"name" or "file,"
it always
refers to a
\f2file\^\f1
name.
.LI
Ellipses \f3\^.\|.\|.\^\f1 are used to show that the previous argument
may be repeated.
.LE
.LI
\f3\s-1DESCRIPTION\s+1\f1
provides an overview of the command.
.LI
\f3\s-1EXAMPLE(S)\s+1\f1
gives
example(s) of usage, where appropriate.
.LI
\f3\s-1FILES\s+1\f1
gives the file names that are
built into the program.
.LI
\f3\s-1SEE ALSO\s+1\f1
offers pointers to related information.
.LI
\f3\s-1DIAGNOSTICS\s+1\f1
discusses
the diagnostic indications that may be produced.
Messages that are intended to be self-explanatory
are not listed.
.LI
\f3\s-1NOTES\s+1\f1
points out potential pitfalls,
bugs and sometimes deficiencies.
.LE
.P
Preceding Section\ 1 are a "Table of Contents"
(listing both primary and secondary command entries)
and a "Permuted Index."
Each line of the "Table of Contents" contains the name of a manual page
(with secondary entries, if they exist)
and an abstract of that page.
Each line of
the "Permuted Index"
represents a permutation (or sorting) of a line from the "Table of Contents"
into three columns.
The lines are arranged so that a keyword or phrase begins the middle column.
Use the "Permuted Index" by searching this middle column for a topic or
command.
When you have found the entry you want,
the right column of that line lists the name of the manual page on which
information corresponding to that keyword can be found.
The left column contains the remainder of the permutation that began
in the middle column.

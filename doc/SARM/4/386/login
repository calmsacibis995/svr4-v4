.SH NAME

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Options for the \f4login\f1 program can be set or changed with keywords
in \f4/etc/default/login\f1.
The following keywords are recognized by \f4login\f1.
.TP .75i
\f4CONSOLE\f1
If set, only the superuser may login on the terminal defined 
at the console.
For example,
.sp .5
.nf
     \f4CONSOLE= /dev/console\f1
.fi
.sp .5
means that only root may login on the console.
If CONSOLE is not in \f4/etc/default/login\f1, the superuser may 
login on any terminal.
.TP
\f4ALTSHELL\f1
If set to \f4YES\f1, the SHELL environment variable will be set to the users shell,
if that shell is not \f4/bin/sh\f1.
If set to \f4NO\f1, the names of nonstandard shells will not be put in the
SHELL environment variable.
The default value for this variable is \f4NO\f1.
For increased security, this should be set to \f4YES\f1.
.TP
\f4PASSREQ\f1
If set to \f4YES\f1, all users must have a password.
Any  user without a password will be asked for one at the first
opportunity permitted by the password aging set for that user
(i.e., users without passwords may not change their
NULL passwords if password aging is enabled for them, and
the minimum time before a password can be changed has not elapsed).
.TP

This variable sets the \f4TZ\f1 variable in the environment of the user.
It must match the timezone set in the \f4/etc/TIMEZONE\f1.

This variable sets the environment \f2HZ\f1, the rate of the system
clock, for the user logging in.
.TP
\f4PATH\f1
This variable sets a default path for a user who does not have uid 0.
.TP
\f4SUPATH\f1
This variable sets the default path for the superuser logging in.
Another default path for the superuser is in
\f4/etc/default/su\f1, which is set for superusers who did not
login in as such.

This variable sets the maximum file size for a user.
It is in units of 512-byte blocks.

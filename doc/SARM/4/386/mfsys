.SH NAME
\f4mfsys\f1  \-  file format.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4mfsys\f1
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \f4mfsys\f1 file contains configuration information for file system types
that are to be included in the next system kernel to be built.
It is included in the directory \f4/etc/conf/cf.d\f1, and includes a one-line
description of each file system type.
The \f4mfsys\f1 file is coalesced from
component files in the directory
\f4/etc/conf/mfsys.d\f1.
Each line contains the following whitespace-separated fields:
.TP 5
1.
\f2name\f1:  This field contains the internal name for the file system type
(e.g., S51K, DUFST).
This name is no more than 32 characters long, and by convention is composed
of upper-case alphanumeric characters.
.TP 5
2.
\f2prefix\f1:  The \f2prefix\f1 in this field is the string prepended to
the \f2fstypsw\f1 handler functions defined for this file system type
(e.g., s5, du).
The prefix must be no more that 8 characters long.
.TP 5
3.
\f2flags\f1:  The \f2flags\f1 field contains a hex number of the form
"0xNN" to be used in populating the \f2fsinfo\f1 data structure table
entry for this file system type.
.TP 5
4.
\f2notify flags\f1:  The \f2notify flags\f1 field contains a hex number
of the form "0xNN" to be used in population the \f2fsinfo\f1 data
structure table entry for this file system type.
.TP 5
5.
\f2function bitstring\f1:  The \f2function bitstring\f1 is a string
of 28 0's and 1's.
Each file system type potentially defines 28 functions to populate
the \f2fstypsw\f1 data structure table entry for itself.
All file system types do not supply all the functions in this table,
however, and this bitstring is used to indicate which of the functions
are present and which are absent.
A '1' in this string indicates that a function has been supplied, and a '0'
indicates that a function has not been supplied.
Successive characters in the string represent successive elements of
the \f2fstypsw\f1 data structure, with the first entry in this data
structure represented by the rightmost character in the string.

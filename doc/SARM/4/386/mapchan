.SH NAME
\f4mapchan\f1 \- Format of tty device mapping files.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4mapchan\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4mapchan\f1 configures the mapping of information input and output of
UNIX.
.P
Each unique channel map requires a 2048-byte buffer for mapping the
input and output of characters.
No buffers are required if no channels are mapped.
.P
A method of sharing maps is implemented for channels that have the
same map in place.
Each additional, unique map allocates an additional buffer.
The maximum number of map buffers available on a system is
configured in the kernel, and is adjustable via the link kit \f4NEMAP\f1
parameter [see \f4config\f1(ADM) and \f4configure\f1(ADM)].
Buffers of maps no longer in use are returned for use by other maps.
.SH "EXAMPLES of a MAP FILE" 
The internal character set used by UNIX System V/386 is defined by the
right column of the  input map, and the first column of the output
map in place on that line.
The default internal character set is the
8-bit ISO 8859/1 character set, which is also known as dpANS X3.4.2
and ISO/TC97/SC2.
It supports the Latin alphabet and can represent most European languages.
.P
Any character value not given is assumed to be a straight mapping.
Only the differences are shown in the \f2mapfile\f1 [see \f4mapchan\fP(1M)].
The left hand column must be unique.
More than one occurence of any entry is an error.
Right hand column characters can appear more than once.
This is many to one mapping.
Nulls can be produced with compose sequences
or as part of an output string.
.P
It is recommended that no mapping be enabled on the channel
used to create or modify the mapping files.
This prevents any confusion of the actual values being entered due to mapping.
It is also recommended that numeric rather than character representations
be used in most cases, as these are not likely to be subject to mapping.
Use comments to identify the characters represented.
Refer to the \f4ascii\f1(5) manual page and hardware reference
manual of the device being mapped for the values to assign.

All of the single letters above preceding the control section must
be in one of these formats:
.sp .5
.RS
.DS
.nf
56	# decimal
045	# octal
0xfa	# hexadecimal
\'b\'	# quoted char
\'\\076\'	# quoted octal
\'\\x4a\'	# quoted hex
.fi
.DE
.RE
.sp .5
.P
All of the above formats are translated to a single byte values.
.P
The control sections (which must be the last in the file) contain
specifications of character sequences which should be passed through
to or from the terminal device without going through the normal \f4mapchan\f1
processing.
These specifications consist of two parts: a fixed sequence of
one or more defined characters indicating the start of a no-map sequence,
followed by a number of characters of which the actual values are unspecified.
.P
To illustrate this, consider a cursor-control sequence which should be passed
directly to the terminal without being mapped.
Such a sequence would typically
begin with a fixed escape sequence instructing the terminal to interpret the
following two characters as a cursor postion; the values of the following
two characters are variable, and depend on the cursor position requested.
Such a control sequence would be specified as:
.br
.DS
.nf

      \E= 2       # Cursor control: escape = <x> <y>
.fi
.DE
.P
There are two subsections under the control section: the input section,
which is used to filter data sent from the terminal to UNIX System V/386, and
the output section, which is used to filter data sent from UNIX System V/386
to the terminal.
The two fields in each control sequence are separated
by white space, that is the SPACE or TAB characters.
Also the \f4#\fP (HASH) character introduces a comment,
causing the remainder of the line to be ignored.
Therefore, if any of these three characters are required
in the specification itself, they should be entered using one of alternative
means of entering characters, as follows:
.IP "\f4^\f2x\f1"
The character produced by the terminal on pressing the CONTROL and
\f2x\f1 keys together.
.IP "\f4\E\f1 or \f4\e\f1"
The ESCAPE character, octal 033.
.IP "\f4\e\f2c\f1"
Where \f2c\fP is one of \f4b\fP, \f4f\fP, \f4l\fP, \f4n\fP, \f4r\fP or \f4t\fP,
produces BACKSPACE, FORMFEED, LINEFEED, NEWLINE, CARRIAGE RETURN or
TAB characters, respectively.
.IP "\f4\O\f1"
Since the NULL character can not be represented, this sequence is not
stored as the character with octal value 0200, which behaves as a NULL
on most terminals.
.IP "\f4\nn\f1 or \f4\nn\f2n\f1"
Specifies the octal value of the character directly.
.IP "\"
Followed by any any other character is interpreted as that character.
This can be used to enter SPACE, TAB, or HASH charaacters.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
\f4mapchan\f1 performs these error checks when processing the \f2mapfile\fP:
.P
.nf
More than one compose key.
Characters mapped to more than one thing. 
Syntax errors in the byte values.
Missing input or output keywords.
Dead or compose keys also occuring in the input section.
Extra information on a line.
Mapping a character to null.
Starting an output control sequence with a character that is already mapped.
.fi
.P
If characters are displayed as the 7-bit value instead of the 8-bit value,
use \f4stty -a\f1 [see stty(1) in the \f2User's Reference Manual\fP]
to verify that \f4-strip\f1 is set.
Make sure \f4input\f1 is mapping to the 8859 character set.
Dead and compose sequences are \f4input\f1 mapping and should be going to 8859.

.SH NOTES
Some non-U.S keyboards and display devices do not support characters
commonly used by UNIX command shells and the C programming language.
Do not attempt to use such devices for system administration tasks.
.P
Not all terminals or printers can display all the characters that
can be represented using this utility.
Refer to the device's hardware
manual for information on the capabilities of the peripheral device.
.SH WARNINGS
Use of mapping files that specify a different internal character
set per-channel, or a set other than the 8-bit ISO 8859 set supplied
by default can cause strange side effects.
It is especially important
to retain the 7-bit ASCII portion of the character set [see \f4ascii\f1(5)]
UNIX System V/386 utilities and applications assume these values.
Media transported between machines with different internal code set mappings
may not be portable as no mapping is performed on block devices, such 
as tape and floppy drives.
\f4trchan\f1 can be used to translate from one internal character set to another.
.sp
Do not set ISTRIP [see \f4stty\f1(1)] on channels that have mapping
that includes eight bit character set.

.SH NAME
\f4dump\f1 
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4/etc/default/dump\f1 file contains keywords that are recognized
by the \f2timeout code\f1.  When the system boots, if there is a system dump
in the swap device, the system will prompt you if you want to \f4save the
dump\f1. After \f2n\f1 seconds, the system will assume \f4NO\f1 to the question.
The keyword \f4TIME\f1 specifies the number of of seconds that the system should
wait before timing out.
.TP
\f4\1TIME\fP=\f2n\fP\f0
If \f2n\f1 is zero, the \f4save the dump\f1 question is never asked.  If
the line is missing, the system will wait forever.  Otherwise, the system
will wait \f2n\f1 seconds.

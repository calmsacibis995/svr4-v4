is an \s-1ASCII\s0 file.
Each field within each user's entry
is separated from the next by a colon.
The comment field can contain any desired information.
Each user is separated from the next by a new-line.
If the shell field is null, \f4/usr/bin/sh\f1
is used.
.PP
This file has user login information
and general read permission.
It can therefore be used, for example,
to map numerical user \s-1ID\s0s to names.
.PP
The \f2password\f1 field consists of the character \f4x\f1.
This field remains only for compatibility reasons.

\f4group\f1 \- group file
.SH DESCRIPTION
The file \f4/etc/group\fP
contains for each group the
following information:
.RS
.PP
group name
.br
encrypted password
.br
numerical group
.SM ID
.br
comma-separated list of all users allowed in the group
.RE
.PP
\f4group\fP
is an
.SM ASCII
file.
The fields are separated by colons;
each group is separated from the next by a new-line.
.PP
Because of the encrypted
passwords, the group file can and does have general read
permission and can be used, for example,
to map numerical group \s-1ID\s0s to names.
.PP
During user identification and authentication, the supplementary group
access list is initialized sequentially from information in this file.
If a user is in more groups than the system is configured for, 
\f4{NGROUPS_MAX}\fP, a warning will be given and subsequent group 
specifications will be ignored.

.SH NAME
\f4rfmaster\f1 \- Remote File Sharing name server master file
.SH DESCRIPTION
Each transport provider used by Remote File Sharing has an
associated \f4rfmaster\f1 file that identifies the primary and
secondary name servers for that transport provider.
The \f4rfmaster\f1 file
.SM ASCII
contains a series of records, each terminated by a newline;
a record may be extended over more than one line by escaping
the newline character with a backslash (``\f4\\\fP'').
The fields in each record are separated by one or more tabs or spaces.
Each record has three fields:
.P
.RS
\f2name	type	data\f1
.RE
.P
The \f2type\f1 field, which defines the meaning of the \f2name\f1 and \f2data\f1
fields, has three possible values.
These values can appear in
upper case or lower case:
.IP \f4p\f1 6
The \f4p\f1 type defines the primary domain name server.
For this type, \f2name\f1 is the domain name and \f2data\f1
is the full host name of the machine that is the primary name server.
The full host name is specified as \f2domain.nodename\f1.
There can be only one primary name server per domain.
.IP \f4s\f1 6
The \f4s\f1 type defines a secondary name server for a domain.
\f2name\f1 and \f2data\f1 are the same as for the \f4p\f1 type.
The order of the \f4s\f1 entries in the \f4rfmaster\f1 file determines the
order in which secondary name servers take over when the current domain
name server fails.
.IP \f4a\f1 6
The \f4a\f1 type defines a network address for a machine.
\f2name\f1 is the full domain name for the machine and \f2data\f1 is the
network address of the machine.
The network address can be in plain
.SM ASCII
text or it can be
preceded by a \f4\ex\fP or \f4\eX\fP to be interpreted as hexadecimal notation.
(See the documentation for the particular
network you are using to determine the network addresses you need.)
.P
If a line in the \f4rfmaster\f1 file begins with a 
\f4#\f1 character, 
the entire line is treated as a comment.
.P
There are at least two lines in the \f4rfmaster\f1 file per domain name server:
one \f4p\f1 and one \f4a\f1 line, to define the primary and its network 
address.
.P
This file is created and maintained on the primary domain name server.
When a machine other than the primary tries to start Remote File Sharing,
this file is read to determine the address of the primary.
If the
associated \f4rfmaster\f1 for a transport provider
is missing, use \f4rfstart \-p\f1 to identify the primary for
that transport provider.
After that, a copy of the primary's \f4rfmaster\f1
file is automatically placed on the machine.
.P
Domains not served by the primary can also be listed in the \f4rfmaster\f1 file.
By adding primary, secondary, and address information for other
domains on a network, machines served by the primary will be able to
share resources with machines in other domains.
.br
.ne 2i
.P
A primary name server may be a primary for more than one domain.
However, the secondaries must then also be the same for each domain
served by the primary.
There is an \f4rfmaster\f1 file for each transport provider.
.SH EXAMPLES
An example of an \f4rfmaster\f1 file is shown below.
(The network
address examples, \f4comp1.serve\f1 and \f4comp2.serve\f1, are 
.SM STARLAN
network addresses.)

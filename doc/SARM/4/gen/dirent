.SH NAME
\f4dirent\f1 \- file system independent directory entry
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4#include <dirent.h>\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
Different file system types may have different
directory entries.
The
\f4dirent\fP
structure defines a file system independent
directory entry, which contains information common to
directory entries in different file system types.
A set of these structures is returned
by the
\f4getdents\fP(2)
system call.
.PP
The 
\f4dirent\fP
structure is defined below.

struct  dirent {
        ino_t            d_ino;
        off_t            d_off;
        unsigned short   d_reclen;
        char             d_name[1];
};

The 
\f4d_ino\fP
is a number which is 
unique for each file
in the file system.
The field
\f4d_off\fP
is the offset of that 
directory entry in the
actual file system directory.
The field
\f4d_name\fP
is the beginning of the
character array giving the name of the
directory entry.
This name is null terminated 
and may have at most \f4MAXNAMLEN\fP
characters.
This results in file system independent
directory entries being variable length
entities.
The value of 
\f4d_reclen\fP
is the record length
of
this entry.
This length is defined to be the
number of bytes between the
current entry and the next one,
so that the next structure will be suitably aligned.

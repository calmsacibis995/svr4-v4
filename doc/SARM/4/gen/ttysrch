.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4ttysrch\f1
is an optional file that is used by the
\f4ttyname\fP
library routine.
This file contains the names of directories in
\f4/dev\fP
that contain terminal and terminal-related device files.
The purpose of this file is to improve the performance of
\f4ttyname\fP
by indicating which subdirectories in
\f4/dev\fP
contain terminal-related device files and should be searched first.
These subdirectory names must appear on separate lines and must
begin with
\f4/dev\fP.
Those path names that do not begin with
\f4/dev\fP
will be ignored and a warning will be sent to the console.
Blank lines (lines containing only white space) and lines beginning
with the comment character "#" will be ignored.
For each file listed (except for the special entry
\f4/dev\fP),
\f4ttyname\fP
will recursively search through subdirectories looking for a match.
If
\f4/dev\fP
appears in the
\f4ttysrch\fP
file, the
\f4/dev\fP
directory itself will be searched but there will not be a recursive search
through its subdirectories.
.PP
When
\f4ttyname\fP
searches through the device files, it tries to find a file whose major/minor
device number, file system identifier, and inode number match that of the
file descriptor it was given as an argument.
If a match is not found, it will settle for a match of just major/minor device
and file system identifier, if one can be found.
However, if the file descriptor is associated with a cloned device (see
clone(7)),
this algorithm does not work efficiently because the inode number of the device file
associated with a clonable device
will never match the inode number of the file descriptor that was returned by
the open of that clonable device.
To help with these situations,
entries can be put into the
\f4/etc/ttysrch\fP
file to improve performance when cloned devices are used as terminals 
on a system (e.g. for remote login).
However, this is only useful if the minor devices related to a cloned device
are put into a subdirectory.
(It is important to note that device files need not exist for cloned devices
and if that is
the case,
\f4ttyname\fP
will eventually fail.)
For example if
\f4/dev/starlan\fP
is a cloned device,
there could be a subdirectory
\f4/dev/slan\fP
that contains files 
\f40\fP,
\f41\fP,
\f42\fP,
etc.
that correspond to the minor devices of the starlan driver.
An optional second field is used in the
\f4/etc/ttysrch\fP
file to indicate the matching criteria.
This field is separated by white space (any combination
of blanks or tabs).
The letter
\f4M\fP
means major/minor device number,
\f4F\fP
means file system identifier,
and
\f4I\fP
means inode number.
If this field is not specified for an entry,
the default is
\f4MFI\fP
which means try to match on all three.
For cloned devices the field should be
\f4MF\fP,
which indicates that it is not necessary to match on the inode number.
.PP
Without the
\f4/etc/ttysrch\fP
file,
\f4ttyname\fP
will search the
\f4/dev\fP
directory by first looking in the directories
\f4/dev/term\fP,
\f4/dev/pts\fP,
and
\f4/dev/xt\fP.
If a system has terminal devices installed in directories
other than these,
it may help performance if the
\f4ttysrch\fP
file is created and contains that list of directories.
.SH EXAMPLE
A sample
\f4/etc/ttysrch\fP
file follows:
.sp
.ft 4
.nf
/dev/term	MFI
/dev/pts		MFI
/dev/xt		MFI
/dev/slan	MF
.fi
.ft 1
.PP
This file tells 
\f4ttyname\fP
that it should first search through those directories listed 
and that when searching through the
\f4/dev/slan\fP
directory, if a file is encountered whose major/minor devices and file
system identifier match that of the file descriptor argument to
\f4ttyname\fP,
this device name
should be considered a match.

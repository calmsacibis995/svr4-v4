.SH DESCRIPTION
These commands are used to alter or query the configuration of the stream
associated with the user's standard input.
The \f4strchg\fP command pushes modules on and/or pops modules off the stream.
The \f4strconf\fP command queries the configuration of the stream.
Only the super-user or owner of a \s-1STREAMS\s+1
device may alter the configuration of that stream.
.PP
With the \f4-h\fP option, \f4strchg\fP pushes modules
onto a stream;
it takes as arguments the names of one or more pushable streams modules.
These modules are pushed in order; that is, \f2module1\fP is pushed first,
\f2module2\fP is pushed second, etc.
.PP
The \f4-p\fP option pops modules off the stream.
With the \f4-p\fP option alone, \f4strchg\fP pops the topmost module
from the stream.
With the \f4-p\fP and \f4-a\fP options, all the modules above the topmost
driver are popped.
When the \f4-p\fP option is followed by \f4-u\fP \f2module\fP, then all
modules above but not including \f2module\fP are popped off the stream.
The \f4-a\fP and \f4-u\fP options are mutually exclusive.
.PP
With the \f4-f\f1 option, the user can specify a \f2file\f1 that contains
a list of modules representing the desired configuration of the stream.
Each module name must appear on a separate line where the first name
represents the topmost module and the last name represents the module
that should be closest to the driver.
The \f4strchg\fP command will determine the current configuration of 
the stream and pop and push the necessary modules in order to end up 
with the desired configuration. 
.PP
The \f4-h\fP, \f4-f\fP and \f4-p\fP options are mutually exclusive.
.PP
Invoked without any arguments, \f4strconf\fP prints a list of all the 
modules in the stream as well as the topmost driver.
The list is printed with one name per line where the first name printed
is the topmost module on the stream (if one exists)
and the last item printed is the name of the driver.
With the \f4-t\fP option, only the topmost module (if one exists) is printed.
The \f4-m\fP option determines if the named \f2module\fP is present on a stream.
If it is, \f4strconf\fP prints the message
\f4yes\f1 and returns zero.
If not, \f4strconf\f1 prints the message \f4no\f1
and returns a non-zero value.
The \f4-t\f1 and \f4-m\f1 options are mutually exclusive.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
The following command pushes the module \f4ldterm\fP on the stream associated
with the user's standard input:
.PP
.ft CW
	strchg -h ldterm
.ft R
.PP
The following command pops the topmost module from the stream
associated with \f4/dev/term/24\fP.
The user must be the owner of this device or the super-user.
.PP
.ft CW
	strchg -p < /dev/term/24
.ft R
.PP
If the file \f4fileconf\f1 contains the following:
.PP
.ft CW
	compat
.br
	ldterm
.br
	ptem
.ft R
.PP
then the command
.PP
.ft CW
	strchg -f fileconf
.ft R
.PP
will configure the user's standard input stream so that the module
\f4ptem\fP is pushed over the driver, followed by \f4ldterm\fP and
\f4compat\fP closest to the stream head.
.PP
The \f4strconf\fP command with no arguments lists the modules and topmost 
driver on the stream; for a stream that has only the module \f4ldterm\fP
pushed above the \f4ports\fP driver, it would produce the following output:
.PP
.ft CW
	ldterm
.br
	ports
.ft R
.PP
The following command asks if \f4ldterm\fP is on the stream
.PP
.ft CW 
	strconf -m ldterm
.ft R
.PP
and produces the following output while returning an exit status of 0:
.PP
.ft CW
	yes
.ft R

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
\f4strchg\fP returns zero on success.
It prints an error message and returns non-zero status for various error 
conditions, including usage error, bad module name, too many modules to push,
failure of an ioctl on the stream, or failure to open \f2file\f1 from the 
\f4-f\fP option.
.PP
\f4strconf\fP returns zero on success (for the \f4-m\fP or \f4-t\fP
option, "success" means the named or topmost module is present).
It returns a non-zero status if invoked with the \f4-m\fP or \f4-t\fP
option and the module is not present.
It prints an error message and returns non-zero status
for various error conditions, including
usage error or failure of an \f4ioctl\f1 on the stream.
.SH "NOTES"
If the user is neither the owner of the stream nor the super-user,
the \f4strchg\fP command will fail.
If the user does not have read permissions on the stream and
is not the super-user, the \f4strconf\fP command will fail.
.PP
If modules are pushed in the wrong order, one could end
up with a stream that does not function as expected.
For ttys, if the line discipline module is not pushed in the
correct place,
one could have a terminal that does not respond to any commands.

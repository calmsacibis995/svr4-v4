.H 2 "Highlights of Version 4 Changes"
.BL
.LI
UNIX System V/386 Release 4 Version 4 contains many software enhancements
for application compatibility.
These changes are reflected in the new Application Compatibility Package.
The documentation changes associated with the new package are
indicated in this document as changes for Application Compatibility.
.LI
Version 4 introduces new installation procedures, which are documented
in a rewritten, reorganized \f2Installation Guide\fP.
.LI
For Version 4, two documents have been significantly restructured.
.DL
.LI
First, the
.BT "Integrated Software Development Guide"
has been combined with the
.BT "Programmer's Guide:  System Services and Application Packaging Tools"
to form a new
.BT "Integrated Software Development Guide" .
.LI
Second, the
.BT "Migration Guide"
and the
.BT "BSD/XENIX\(rg Compatibility Guide"
have been combined, along with compatibility information from the
.BT "Integrated Software Development Guide" ,
into the
.BT "Migration and Compatibility Guide" .
.LE
.LE
.SK
.H 2 "Summary of Changes for the Version 4 Documentation Set"

SSAPT Chapter 8 and Appendix C of the same names, and hence were
not brought over from the SSAPT.

.H 3 "Reasons for Document Revision"
.H 4 "Presentation of Information"
The organizational changes discussed above present information for the same
functional area together to highlight the subject matter
and make the ISDG work better as a textbook on UNIX software development.
.H 4 "SSAPT and ISDG Conflicts"
Both the Version 3 SSAPT and the Version 3 ISDG
address application programmers and Independent Software Vendors (ISVs).
The SSAPT is aimed primarily at first time UNIX
software developers while the ISDG is intended for more
sophisticated programmers developing
device-drivers and low-level graphics applications in particular.
Unfortunately, both books contain a discussion of SVR4 application
packaging which varies just enough to confuse a reader who sees them both.
In addition, they present the same application programming example,
\f4liber\fP, a library system.
.H 3 "Document Mapping"
The following diagram shows how files from the Version 3 SSAPT
and Version 3 ISDG map into the Version 4 ISDG and Version 4
.BT "Migration and Compatibility Guide" .
.VL 1.20i .25i
.LI "Solid Lines \(em"
mean either a single chapter from the Version 3 document has been broken
up into several chapters for the Version 4 document,
or that a several chapters from the Version 3 document have been
combined into a single chapter in the Version 4 document.
.LI "Dotted Lines \(em"
mean that the chapter has been moved from the Version 3 document
to the Version 4 document intact.
.LI "Dashed Lines \(em"
mean that only one of a pair of duplicate chapters has been moved from the
Version 3 document to the Version 4 document.

.H 2 "Migration and Compatibility Guide (MCG)"
.H 3 "Document Description"
This volume contains three guide sections, two of which contain their
associated manual pages.
The first guide section, entitled ``Migration Guide,''
is aimed at programmers
who are upgrading from an earlier release of UNIX System V.
It describes changes made to UNIX System V as it has evolved to
successive releases up to Release 4.
.P
The second guide section, entitled
``Programmer's Guide:  Application Compatibility,''
describes the capabilities of application compatibility software
provided through the Application Compatibility Package.
This compatibility package permits most applications that currently run on
XENIX systems to run on UNIX System V Release 4.
This guide includes manual pages for all tools and facilities
contained in the Application Compatibility Package.
.P
The third guide section is the
``Programmer's Guide:  BSD System Compatibility.''
This section describes the capabilities of BSD that have been provided
in the BSD Compatibility Package.
This compatibility package permits most applications that currently run on
BSD and SunOS systems to run on UNIX System V Release 4.
This guide includes manual pages for all tools and facilities
contained in the BSD Compatibility Package.
.P
Only manual pages from this document are included on the SCP MRD tape.

.H 1 "Special Printing Instructions"
.H 2 "Release Documents"
The documents that are release-dependent, that is, they change
with each release of the product, are generally referred to as
Release Documents.
Except for the
.BT "Source Code Product Machine Readable Documentation Release Notes"
and the
.BT "Technology-File Mapping Guide
the following release documents are on both the MRD tape and
included as hard copy with the source code product:
.BL
.LI
.BT "Read Me First"
.LI
.BT "Software Notes"
.LI
.BT "Source Code Product Build Instructions"
.LI
.BT "Source Code Product Machine Readable Documentation Release Notes"
.LI
.BT "Technology-File Mapping Guide
.LE
If you print these documents from the MRD tape, use the \f4-s4\fP
option in the format printing line.
For example, your format command will probably look like this:
.UI
format -d\f2printername\fP -s4 \f2filename\fP
.SF

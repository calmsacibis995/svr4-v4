.SH NAME
\f4mb2a_brdcst\f1 \- Sends a broadcast message in asynchronous mode.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.ft 4
.nf
#include <sys/types.h>

int fd;
unsigned short portid;

.SH DESCRIPTION
This routine is used to send broadcast messages in asynchronous mode.
.TP .7i
\f4fd\f1
specifies an asynchronous mode file descriptor referencing
an open port.
.TP
\f4portid\f1
is the port to which broadcasts are sent.
.TP
\f4ctlbufptr\f1
is a pointer to a buffer describing the control
portion of the message to be broadcast.
.P
To broadcast a message, \f4ctlbufptr\f1 must be non-NULL and the len
field of \f4ctlbufptr\f1 must have a value greater than 0.
A NULL message can be
broadcast if the \f4ctlbufptr\f1
is NULL or the len field is set to 0.
The maximum
control portion of the broadcast message is 20 bytes.
\f4mb2a_brdcst\f1 fails
with a return value of -1 and \f4errno\fP set to \f4EAGAIN\f1
if the send side queue is
full due to internal flow control conditions.
The flow control parameters can
be set at the time the port is opened.
.P
\f4mb2a_brdcst\f1 blocks when waiting for the availablility of internal
buffers.
When the routine returns, the message has been either broadcast or has
been queued to be broadcast.
No completion or error indication is returned to
the user if the transfer fails.
.P
Upon successful completion of the routine, a value of 0 is returned.
A value of -1 is returned and an \f4errno\fP is set if there were errors.
The following is a list of applicable errors for this routine.
.TP .7i
\f4EAGAIN\f1
buffers could not be allocated for message to
be sent.
.TP .7i
\f4EAGAIN\f1
the message could not be sent due to flow
control conditions.
.TP .7i
\f4EBADF\f1
\f4fd\f1 is not a valid file descriptor.
.TP .7i
\f4EFAULT\f1
\f4ctlbufptr\fP points outside the allocated address
space.
.TP .7i
\f4EINTR\f1
a signal was caught during the \f4mb2a_brdcst\f1
call.
.TP .7i
\f4ENOSTR\f1
\f4fd\f1 is not a file descriptor to a MB II
transport endpoint.
.TP .7i
\f4EINVAL\f1
an invalid value was specified in one of the
argument buffers.
.TP .7i
\f4ERANGE\f1
the size of the control part of the message is
outside the range of minimum/maximum allowable message size.

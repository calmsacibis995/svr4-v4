.SH NAME
\f4mb2a_sendcancel\f1 \- Sends a cancel message asynchronously.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.ft 4
.nf
#include <sys/types.h>

int mb2a_sendcancel (fd, socketidptr, tid)
int fd
mb2_socket *socketidptr;

.SH DESCRIPTION
This routine is used to send a cancel message for a transaction.
Only
MB II transport servers use this routine.
.TP .9i
\f4fd\f1
specifies an asynchronous mode file descriptor referencing
an open port.
.TP .9i
\f4socketidptr\f1
points to a structure containing the socket ID of
the destination of the message (the socket ID of the client where the
transaction was initiated).
.TP .9i
\f4tid\f1
is the transaction ID identifying the transaction to be
canceled.
.P
The \f4tid\f1 must be obtained from a previously received active transaction
request message (\f4MB2_REQ_MSG\fP or \f4MB2_REQFRAG_MSG\fP).
\f4mb2a_sendcancel\f1 does not
block and fails with \f4errno\fP set to
\f4EAGAIN\f1 if the send side queue is full due to
internal flow control conditions.
The flow control parameters can be set at
the time when the port is opened.
.P
\f4mb2a_sendcancel\f1 blocks when waiting for the availability of internal
buffers if these buffers are unavailable.
When this routine returns, the
message has been sent out.
No completion or error condition is returned to
the user if the transfer fails.
.P
Upon successful completion of the routine, a value of 0 is returned.
A
value of -1 is returned and an \f4errno\fP is set if there were errors.
The
following is a list of applicable errors for this routine.
.TP .7i
\f4EAGAIN\f1
buffers could not be allocated for message to
be sent.
.TP .7i
\f4EAGAIN\f1
the message could not be sent due to flow
control conditions.
.TP .7i
\f4EBADF\f1
\f4fd\f1 is not a valid file descriptor.
.TP .7i
\f4EFAULT\f1
\f4socketidptr\fP points outside the allocated
address space.
.TP .7i
\f4EINTR\f1
a signal was caught during the call.
.TP .7i
\f4EINVAL\f1
invalid value specified by one of the arguments.
.TP .7i
\f4ENXIO\f1
a hardware error condition was generated when sending
the message.
.TP .7i
\f4ENOSTR\f1
\f4fd\f1 is not a file descriptor to a Multibus II
transport endpoint.

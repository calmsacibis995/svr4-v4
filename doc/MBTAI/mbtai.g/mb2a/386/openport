.SH NAME
\f4mb2a_openport\f1 \- Opens an asynchronous Multibus II transport endpoint.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.ft 4
.nf
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/mb2taiusr.h>
int mb2a_openport (portid, optptr)
unsigned short portid;
mb2_opts *optptr;

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4mb2a_openport\f1 function is called as the first step in the
initialization of a transport endpoint.
This routine establishes a
Multibus II transport endpoint for the asynchronous mode of operation,
by opening a UNIX system file that identifies a transport provider.
The
\f4mb2a_openport\f1 function binds a port ID to the endpoint, sets the endpoint
parameters to the options specified, and returns the file descriptor
corresponding to the endpoint.
This file descriptor must only be used with
other asynchronous mode transport-application interface routines.
.TP .7i
\f4portid\f1
When \f4portid\f1 is non-zero, the endpoint corresponding to the
file descriptor is bound to the port.
.IP
When \f4portid\f1 is set to zero, this routine allocates a free
port ID from a range of dynamically allocated port IDs and binds the
endpoint to that port.
.TP
\f4optptr\f1
is a pointer to an options structure specifying the
endpoint options to be set.
.IP
When \f4optptr\f1 is NULL, the endpoint options are set to default
values.
.IP
When \f4optptr\f1 is non-NULL, then the endpoint options are set
to the values provided in the options structure.
.P
All or some of the values in the options structure can be specified to
be default values if set to \f4MB2_OPTDEFAULT\fP.
Upon successful completion of the
routine, the file descriptor is returned.
A value of -1 is returned and an
\f4errno\f1 is set if there were errors.
The following is a list of applicable
errors for this routine.
.TP .7i
\f4EFAULT\f1
\f4optptr\f1 points outside the allocated address space.
.TP .7i
\f4EINVAL\f1
the values of options, flags or parameters are
out of range.
.TP
\f4EMFILE\f1
\f4NOFILES\fP file descriptors are currently open.
.TP .7i
\f4EINTR\f1
a signal was caught during the open operation.
.TP
\f4ENOSR\f1
unable to allocate a stream.
.TP
\f4ENFILE\f1
the system file table is full.
.TP .7i
\f4ENXIO\f1
A STREAMS module or driver open failed.
.TP .7i
\f4EAGAIN\f1
\f4portid\f1 was 0 and all dynamically allocatable
port IDs are in use.
.TP
\f4EBUSY\f1
\f4portid\f1 was non-zero and the specified port ID is
already open.
.TP
\f4EIO\f1
a hangup or error occurred during a STREAMS
open.

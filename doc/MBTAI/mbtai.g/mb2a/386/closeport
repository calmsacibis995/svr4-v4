.SH NAME
\f4mb2a_closeport\f1 \- Closes an asynchronous Multibus II transport endpoint.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.ft 4
.nf
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/mb2taiusr.h>
int mb2a_closeport (fd)
int fd;
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4mb2a_closeport\f1 function is invoked to close a previously opened
asynchronous Multibus II transport endpoint.
\f4fd\f1 must be a file descriptor
obtained from a call to \f4mb2a_openport\f1.
This routine unbinds the endpoint
from the associated Port ID, frees the Port ID if it is in the range of
dynamically allocated port ID's, and issues a close for that file descriptor.
Upon successful completion of the routine, a value of 0 is returned.
A value of -1 is returned and an \f4errno\fP
is set if there were errors.
The following is a list of applicable errors for this routine.
.TP .7i
\f4EBADF\f1
\f4fd\f1 does not correspond to an open MB II endpoint.
.TP .7i
\f4ENOSTR\f1
a stream is not associated with \f4fd\f1.
.TP .7i
\f4EINTR\f1
a signal was caught during the close operation.
.TP
\f4EIO\f1
an error occurred during a STREAMS close.

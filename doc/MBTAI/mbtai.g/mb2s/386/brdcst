.SH DESCRIPTION
This routine is used to send broadcast messages in synchronous mode.
.TP 15
\f4fd\f1
specifies a synchronous mode file descriptor referencing an
open port.
.TP
\f4portid\f1
is the port where broadcasts should be sent.
.TP
\f4ctlbufptr\f1
is a pointer to a buffer describing the control
portion of the message to be broadcast.
.P
To broadcast a message,
\f4ctlbufptr\f1
must be non-NULL and the
\f4len\f1
field of
\f4ctlbufptr\f1
must have a value greater than 0.
A NULL message can be
broadcast if the \f4ctlbufptr\fP is NULL or the \f4len\fP field is set to 0.
.P
The maximum size control portion of the broadcast message is 20 bytes.
\f4mb2s_brdcst\f1 blocks when the send side queue is full due to internal flow
control conditions.
Flow control parameters can be set at the time the port is
opened.
\f4mb2s_brdcst\f1
also blocks when waiting for the availablility of
internal buffers.
When the routine returns, the message has been either
broadcast or has been queued for broadcast.
No completion or error indication
returns to the user if the transfer fails.
.P
Upon successful completion of the routine, a value of 0 is returned.
A value of
\%\f4-1\f1
is returned and an
\f4errno\f1
is set if there were errors.
The
following is a list of applicable errors for this routine.
.TP 10
\f4EAGAIN\f1
buffers could not be allocated for message to
be sent.
.TP
\f4EBADF\f1
\f4fd\f1
is not a valid file descriptor.
.TP
\f4EFAULT\f1
\f4ctlbufptr\f1
points outside the allocated address
space.
.TP
\f4EINTR\f1
a signal was caught during the
\f4mb2s_brdcst\f1
call.
.TP
\f4ENOSTR\f1
\f4fd\f1
is not a file descriptor to an endpoint.
.TP
\f4EINVAL\f1
invalid value specified in one of the argument
buffers.
.TP
\f4ERANGE\f1
the size of the control part of the message is
outside the range of the minimum/maximum allowable message size.

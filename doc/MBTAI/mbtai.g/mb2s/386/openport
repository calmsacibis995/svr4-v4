.SH NAME
\f4mb2s_openport\f1 \- Opens a synchronous \f4Multibus II\f1 transport endpoint.
.SH SYNOPSIS

.nf
#include <sys/types.h>

int mb2s_openport (portid, optptr)
unsigned short portid;

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4mb2s_openport\f1 function is called as the first step in the
initialization of a transport endpoint.
This function establishes a \f4Multibus II\f1
transport endpoint for a synchronous mode of operation, by opening a UNIX
system file that identifies a transport provider.
The \f4mb2s_openport\f1
function binds a port ID to the endpoint, sets the endpoint parameters to the
options specified, and returns the file descriptor corresponding to the
endpoint.
This file descriptor can only be used with other synchronous mode
transport application interface routines.
.TP 10
\f4portid\f1
When \f4portid\fP is non-zero, the endpoint corresponding to the
file descriptor is bound to the port.
.IP
When \f4portid\fP is set to zero, this routine allocates a free
port ID from a range of dynamically allocated port IDs and binds the
endpoint to that port.
.TP
\f4optptr\f1
is a pointer to an options structure specifying the
endpoint options to be set.
.IP
When \f4optptr\f1 is NULL, the endpoint options are set to default
values.
.IP
When \f4optptr\fP is non-NULL, then the endpoint options are set
to the values provided in the options structure.
.P
All or some of the values in the options structure can be specified to be
default values if set to \f4MB2_OPTDEFAULT\f1.
Upon successful completion of the
routine, the file descriptor is returned.
A value of -1 is returned and an
\f4errno\fP is set if there were errors.
The following is a list of applicable
errors for this routine.
.TP 10
\f4EFAULT\f1
\f4optptr\fP points outside the allocated address
space.
.TP
\f4EINVAL\f1
values of options, flags or parameters is out
of range.
.TP
\f4EMFILE\f1
\f4NOFILES\fP file descriptors are currently open.
.TP
\f4EINTR\f1
a signal was caught during the open operation.
.TP
\f4ENOSR\f1
unable to allocate a stream.
.TP
\f4ENFILE\f1
the system file table is full.
.TP
\f4ENXIO\f1
a STREAMS module or driver open failed.
.TP
\f4EAGAIN\f1
\f4portid\fP is 0 and too many dynamically allocated
port IDs are in use.
.br
.ne 5
.TP
\f4EBUSY\f1
\f4portid\fP is non-zero and the specified port ID is already
open.
.TP
\f4EIO\f1
a hangup or error occured during a STREAMS open.

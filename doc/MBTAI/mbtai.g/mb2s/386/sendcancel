.SH NAME
\f4mb2s_sendcancel\f1 \- Sends a cancel message in synchronous
mode.
.SH SYNOPSIS

#include <sys/types.h>

.SH DESCRIPTION
This routine is used to send a cancel message for a transaction.
Only
\f4Multibus II\f1 transport servers use this routine.
.TP 15
\f4fd\f1
specifies a synchronous mode file descriptor referencing an
open port.
.TP
\f4socketidptr\f1
points to a structure containing the socket ID of
the destination of the message (the socket ID of the client where the
transaction was initiated).
.TP
\f4tid\f1
is the transaction ID identifying the transaction to be
canceled.
The \f4tid\f1
must have been obtained from a previously received active
transaction request message such as \f4MB2_REQ_MSG\f1 or \f4MB2_REQFRAG_MSG\f1.
.P
\f4mb2s_sendcancel\f1 blocks when the send side queue is full due to
internal flow control conditions.
The flow control parameters can be set at
the time when the port is opened.
(Flow control is discussed in Appendix A.)
\f4mb2s_sendcancel\f1 also blocks when waiting for the availability of internal
buffers if these buffers are unavailable.
When this routine returns, the
message has been sent out.
No completion or error conditions are returned to
the user if the transfer fails.
.P
Upon successful completion of the routine, a value of 0 is returned.
A
value of -1 is returned and an \f4errno\fP is set if there were errors.
The following is a list of applicable errors for this routine.
.TP 10
\f4EAGAIN\f1
buffers could not be allocated for the message
to be sent.
.TP
\f4EBADF\f1
\f4fd\fP is not a valid file descriptor.
.TP
\f4EFAULT\f1
\f4socketidptr\f1 points outside the allocated
address space.
.TP
\f4EINTR\f1
a signal was caught during the call.
.TP
\f4EINVAL\f1
an invalid value was specified by one of the
arguments.
.TP
\f4ENXIO\f1
a hardware error condition was generated when sending
the message.
.TP
\f4ENOSTR\f1
\f4fd\fP is not a file descriptor to a \f4Multibus II\f1
transport endpoint.

.SH NAME
\f4fd\f1 \- diskette (floppy disk)
.SH DESCRIPTION
The diskette driver provides access to diskettes as both block and character
devices.
Diskettes must be formatted before their use [see
\f4format(1)\f1].
Both 5.25" and 3.50" diskette formats are supported.
The driver controls up to two diskette drives.
The minor device number specifies
the drive number, the format of the diskette and the
partition number.
.PP
Diskette device file names (which correspond to a specific major and minor
device) use the following format:
.IP
\f4/dev/{r}dsk/{0,1}{5h,5d9,5d8,5d4,5d16,5q,3h,3d}{t,u}\f1
.PP
where \f4r\f1 indicates a raw (character) interface to the diskette,
\f4rdsk\f1 selects the raw device interface and \f4dsk\f1
selects the block device interface.
\f40\f1 or \f41\f1 selects the drive to be accessed:
\f4f0\f1 selects floppy drive 0, while \f4f1\f1 selects drive 1.
The following list describes the format to be interacted
with:
.sp \n(PDu
.RS

.TP 8
\f45h\f1
5.25" high density diskette (1.2MB).
.TP
\f45d9\f1
5.25" double density diskette, 9 sectors per track (360KB).
.TP
\f45d8\f1
5.25" double density diskette, 8 sectors per track (320KB).
.TP
\f45d4\f1
5.25" double density diskette, 4 sectors per track (320KB).
.TP
\f45d16\f1
5.25" double density diskette, 16 sectors per track (320KB).
.TP
\f45q\f1
5.25" quad density diskette (720KB).
.TP
\f43h\f1
3.50" high density diskette (1.44MB).
.TP
\f43d\f1
3.50" double density diskette (720KB).

Format specification is mandatory when opening the device for
formatting.
However, when accessing a floppy disk for other
operations (read and write), the format specification field can be
omitted.
In this case, the floppy disk driver will automatically
determine the format previously established on the diskette and
then perform the requested operation (for example,
\f4cpio -itv</dev/rsdk/f1).
.PP
The last parameter, \f4t\f1 or \f4u\f1, selects the
partition to be accessed.
\f4t\f1 represents the whole diskette.
Without \f4t\f1 or \f4u\f1 specified, the whole
diskette except cylinder 0 will be selected.
\f4u\f1 represents the whole diskette except track 0 of cylinder 0
and applies only to the 568 type of floppy (floppies created
on AT&T UNIX computer).
.PP
Besides the device file naming convention described above,
some of the formats have alias names that correlate to
previous releases.
The following list describes the formats that have an alias:

.PP
For example, the device file \f4/dev/rdsk/f0q15dt\f1 is
equivalent to \f4/dev/rdsk/f05ht\f1.
.PP
In order to minimize errors when using diskettes, the driver attempts to
assure that the diskette is installed when needed, and that the operations
requested have been completed before the device close is completed.
In particular, the drive is checked for the presence of a diskette each time
a read/write request is made to the drive.
If this is not true (either the
diskette is not physically present or the door is open), the driver retries
the request continually, at five-second intervals.
The message:
.sp .5
.br
.ti +.25i
\f4FD(\f2n\fP): diskette not present \- please insert\f1
.PP
appears after each attempt (the \f2n\f1 represents the drive number).
The INTR and QUIT signals are honored in this case,
so that the process accessing the diskette drive in question
will receive these signals
(unless, of course, the process itself is ignoring them).
In particular, if the diskette is removed prematurely,
or not inserted soon enough,
.I "no data is lost,"
provided the correct diskette is inserted in the drive when the message to do
so is displayed.
.SS Ioctl Calls
.TP
\f4V_GETPARMS\f1
This call is used to get information about the current drive configuration.
The argument to the \f4ioctl\f1 is the address of one of the following structures,
defined in
\f4<sys/vtoc.h>\f1,
which will be filled in by the \f4ioctl\f1:
.nf
.ta 4m 8m 12m 16m 20m 24m 28m 32m 36m 40m 44m 48m 52m 56m 60m
.IP
\f4
struct disk_parms {
\*Tchar\*Tdp_type;\*T/* Disk type (see below) */
\*Tunchar\*Tdp_heads;\*T/* Number of heads */
\*Tushort\*Tdp_cyls;\*T\*T/* Number of cylinders */
\*Tunchar\*Tdp_sectors;\*T/* Number of sectors/track */
\*Tushort\*Tdp_secsiz;\*T/* Number of bytes/sector */
\*T\*T\*T\*T\*T/* for this partition: */
\*Tushort\*Tdp_ptag;\*T/* Partition tag (not used) */
\*Tushort\*Tdp_pflag;\*T/* Partition flag (not used) */

\*Tushort\*Tdp_pnumsec;\*T/* Number of sectors */
}

/* Disk types */
#define\*TDPT_WINI\*T1\*T/* Winchester disk */
#define\*TDPT_FLOPPY\*T2\*T/* Floppy */
#define\*TDPT_OTHER\*T3\*T/* Other type of disk */
#define\*TDPT_NOTDISK\*T0\*T/* Not a disk device */
\f1
.fi
.DT
.IP
For the floppy driver, the disk type will always be DPT_FLOPPY.
The unused
fields in the disk_parms structure are only applicable to hard disks;
however, returning the same structure from both the hard disk driver and
the diskette driver allows programs to be written that can understand either
one.
.TP
\f4V_FORMAT\f1
This call is used to format tracks on a diskette.
The argument passed to the
\f4ioctl\f1 is the address of one of the following structures, defined in
\f4<sys/vtoc.h>\f1,
containing the starting track, number of tracks, and
interleave factor:
.nf
.ta 4m 8m 12m 16m 20m 24m 28m 32m 36m 40m 44m 48m 52m 56m 60m
.IP
\f4union io_arg {
\*Tstruct {
\*T\*Tushort\*Tstart_trk;\*T/* first track */
\*T\*Tushort\*Tnum_trks;\*T/* number of tracks
					to format */
\*T\*Tushort\*Tintlv;\*T\*T/* interleave factor */
\*T} ia_fmt;
} \f1
.fi
.DT
.IP
Formatting will start at the given track and will continue so that the
given number of tracks are formatted, using the given interleave factor.
.IP
Note that the file descriptor must refer to the character (raw) special
device for the desired drive, and the file must have been opened in exclusive
mode (i.e., O_EXCL).

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The driver will retry failed transfers up to ten times.
If the request still has not succeeded,
the driver will display an appropriate message.
Errors from the diskette controller, other than the above,
are displayed as follows:
.sp .25
.nf
     \f4FD\f1  \f4drv n, blk b: drive error message\f1
     \f4FD\f1 \f4controller controller error message\f1
.fi
.PP
The first message occurs on an error after a transfer has begun, where
\f4n\f1 is the drive where the error occurred,
and \f4b\f1 is the block number
that is being read or written.
The
.I drive error message
is one of the messages appearing in the following list:
.TP
\f4Missing data address mark\f1
The diskette may not be formatted properly.
.TP
\f4Cylinder marked bad\f1
The accessed cylinder has been marked bad by the formatter.
.TP
\f4Seek error (wrong cylinder)\f1
The drive positioned itself at the wrong cylinder when attempting to set up
for the requested transfer.
.TP
\f4Uncorrectable data read error\f1
A CRC error was detected when attempting to read the requested block from
the drive.
.TP
\f4Sector marked bad\f1
The accessed sector has been marked bad by the formatter.
.TP
\f4Missing header address mark\f1
The diskette may not be formatted properly.
.TP
\f4Write protected\f1
A write was attempted to a diskette that is currently write-protected.
.TP
\f4Sector not found\f1
The diskette may not be formatted properly.
.TP
\f4Data overrun\f1
The system could not keep up with the requested transfer of data.
(Should not occur.)
.TP
\f4Header read error\f1
The diskette may not be formatted properly.
.TP
\f4Illegal sector specified\f1
The driver is confused about the format of the diskette that has been
inserted.
(Should not occur.)
.PP
The second message occurs when there is a controller error during the setup
for, or actual transfer of, a block.
The
.I controller error message
is one of the messages appearing in the following list:
.TP
\f4command timeout\f1
The controller failed to complete the requested command in a reasonable
length of time.
.TP
\f4status timeout\f1
The controller failed to return its status after a command was completed.
.TP
\f4busy\f1
During an attempt to access the controller, a timeout occurred.

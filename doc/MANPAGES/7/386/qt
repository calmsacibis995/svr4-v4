These files refer to the Wangtek PC-36 Controller
and the QIC-24/QIC-02 basic cartridge tape streamer.
Only raw character interface files are provided.
When opened for reading or writing,
the tape is assumed to be positioned as desired.
If the file was retension-on-open,
the tape is retensioned before any I/O is performed.
When a \f4T_RWD\f1, \f4T_RETENSION\f1, \f4T_LOAD\f1, or \f4T_UNLOAD\f1 \f4ioctl\f1
is requested after a \f4write\f1,
a double end-of-file (double tape mark) is written
before the \f4ioctl\f1 is executed.
When a rewind-on-close file is closed,
a double end-of-file (double tape mark) is written if
the file was opened for writing and data was written.
When a rewind-on-close file is closed, the tape is rewound.
If the file is no-rewind-on-close and was opened for writing
and data was written, only one EOF is written,
and the tape is positioned after the EOF just written.
If the file was no-rewind and the file was opened for read-only,
the tape is positioned after the EOF following the data just read.
The EOF is returned as a zero-length read.
By judiciously choosing \f4qt\f1 files,
it is possible to read and write multi-file tapes.
.P
A standard tape consists of several 512-byte records
terminated by an EOF.
To the extent possible,
the system treats the tape like any other file.
As in other raw devices, seeks are ignored.
An EOF is returned as a zero-length read,
with the tape positioned after the EOF,
so that the next read will return the next record.
.P
Only one process is permitted to have any of the tape files
open at a given time to the extent it is enforceable.
Writing after reading is permitted,
but reading after writing without an intervening rewind is not.
If \f4O_NDELAY\f1 is clear,
opening a retension-on-open file will block
until the retension is complete.
If \f4O_NDELAY\f1 is set, open will return without delay.
Opening a file with \f4O_APPEND\f1 set is an error (\f4EINVAL\f1).

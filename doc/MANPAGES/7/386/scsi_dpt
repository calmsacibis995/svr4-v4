.SH NAME
\*(dr \- \*(ha SCSI host adapter subsystem 
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \*(ha host adapter subsystem serves as a means for SCSI target
drivers (such as \f4scsi_disk\fP, \f4scsi_tape\fP, and so on) to communicate
on the SCSI bus with target controllers and logical units.  
This driver implements the SCSI Driver Interface (SDI) 
for such SCSI target drivers.
.PP
It is also possible to access this subsystem via the pass-through
driver interface.
To find the appropriate device to use, while any 
device is being accessed through the target driver, use the \f4B_GETDEV\fP
\f4ioctl\fP to get the major and minor numbers of the pass-through node.
This node may be created and opened for use.
.SH "ioctl Calls"
There are three groups of \f4ioctl\fP commands [see \f4ioctl\fP(2) in the
\f2Programmer's Reference Manual\fP] supported by \*(dr.
The first group contains the \f4ioctl\fP commands used by the
\*(dr driver itself:
.RS
.TP 15
\f4SDI_SEND\fP
Used to send a pass-through command to a target controller, bypassing
the associated target driver.
.TP
\f4SDI_BRESET\fP
Used to reset the SCSI bus.
.TP
\f4B_REDT\fP
Used to read the extended \f4edt\fP data structure that is
stored in the \*(dr driver's internal data structure. 
.TP
\f4B_HA_CNT\fP
Used to get the value of the number of host adapters the \*(dr driver
is configured for.
.RE
.LP
The second group is used by the \*(dr driver and all target drivers
that use the SDI protocol to communicate with
their associated target controllers.
.RS
.TP 15
\f4B_GETTYPE\fP
Return the bus name (for example, \f4scsi\fP) and device driver name of a 
specific device.
.RE
.LP
The third group should be supported by all target drivers
that use the SDI protocol to communicate with
their associated target controllers.
This \f4ioctl\fP is not supported by the 
\*(dr driver.
.RS
.TP 15
\f4B_GETDEV\fP
Return the pass-through major and minor numbers to the calling utility
to allow creation of a pass-through special device file.

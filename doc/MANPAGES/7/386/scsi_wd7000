.SH NAME
\f4scsi_wd7000\fP \- WD7000 FASST2 host adapter subsystem
.SH DESCRIPTION
The WD7000 FASST2 SCSI host adapter subsystem serves as a means for SCSI
targer drivers (such as \f4scsi_disk\fP, \f4scsi_tape\fP, and so on) to
communicate on the SCSI bus with target controllers and logical units.
This driver inplements the SCSI Driver Interface (SDI) for such SCSI
target drivers.
.PP
It is also possible to access this subsystem via the pass-through
driver.
To find the appropriate device to use, while the device
is being  accessed through the target driver, use the \f4B_GETDEV\fP 
\f4ioctl\fP to get the major and minor numbers of the pass-though node.
This node may either be created or opened for use.
.SH "ioctl Calls"
There are three groups of \f4ioctl\fP commands [see \f4ioctl\fP(2) in the
\f2Programmer's Reference Manual\fP]
supported by this driver.
The first group contains the
\f4ioctl\fP commands used by the driver itself.
.RS
.TP 15
\f4SDI_SEND\fP
Used to send a pass through command to a target controller
bypassing the associated target driver.
.TP
\f4SDI_BRESET\fP
Used to reset the SCSI bus.
.TP
\f4B_REDT\fP
Used to read the extended \f4edt\fP data structure that is stored in
the \f4scsi\fP driver's internal data structure.
.TP
\f4B_HA_CNT\fP
Used to get the value of the number of host adapters the \f4scsi\fP
driver is configured for.
.TP
\f4HA_VER\fP
Used to determine the Driver Interface
Version supported by the driver.
It returns the structure
\f4ver_no\fP, defined in \f4/usr/include/sys/sdi.h\fP.
.RE
.P
The second group is used by the
driver and all target drivers that
use the SDI protocol to communicate with their associated
target controllers.
.RS
.TP 15
\f4B_GETTYPE\fP
Return the bus name (for example, \f4scsi\fP) and device driver name of 
a specific device.
.RE
.P
The third group should be supported by all the target drivers 
that use the SDI
protocol to communicate with their associated
target controllers.
This \f4ioctl\fP is not supported by the \f4scsi_wd7000\fP driver.
.RS
.TP 15
\f4B_GETDEV\fP
Return the pass through major and minor numbers to the calling
utility to allow creation of a pass-through special device file.

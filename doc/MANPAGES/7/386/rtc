.SH NAME
\f4rtc\f1 \- real time clock interface
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4rtc\f1 driver supports the real time clock chip,
allowing it to be set with the correct local time
and allowing the time to be read from the chip.
.SS Ioctl Calls
.TP
\f4RTCRTIME\f1
This call is used to read the local time from the real time clock chip.
The argument to the
.I ioctl
is the address of a buffer of
\f4RTCNREG\f1
unsigned characters
(\f4RTCNREG\f1 is defined in
\f4<sys/rtc.h>\f1 ).
The \f4ioctl\f1 will fill in the buffer
with the contents of the chip registers.
Currently,
\f4RTCNREG\f1
is 14,
and the meanings of the byte registers are as follows:
.PP
.TS
center box tab(:) ;
cB | cB
c | l .
Register:Contents
.sp .2v
_
0:Seconds
1:Second alarm
2:Minutes
3:Minute alarm
4:Hours
5:Hour alarm
6:Day of week
7:Date of month
8:Month
9:Year
A:Status register A
B:Status register B
C:Status register C
D:Status register D
.sp .2v
.TE
.PP
.IP
For further information on the functions of these registers,
see your hardware technical reference manual.
.TP
\f4RTCSTIME\f1
This call is used to set the time into the real time clock chip.
The argument to
\f4ioctl\f1
is the address of a buffer of
\f4RTCNREGP\f1
unsigned characters
(\f4RTCNREGP\f1
is defined in
\f4<sys/rtc.h>\f1).
These bytes should be the desired chip register contents.
Currently,
\f4RTCNREGP\f1
is 10, representing registers 0\-9 as shown above.
Note that only the super-user may open the
real time clock device for writing and that the
\f4RTCSTIME\f1
\f4ioctl\f1
will fail for any other than the super-user.

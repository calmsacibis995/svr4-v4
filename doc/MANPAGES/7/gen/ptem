.SH NAME
\f4ptem\fP \- \s-1STREAMS\s0 Pseudo Terminal Emulation module
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4ptem\f1 is a \s-1STREAMS\s0 module that when used in conjunction with a
line discipline and pseudo terminal driver emulates a terminal.
.PP
The \f4ptem\f1 module must be pushed [see \f4I_PUSH, streamio\fP(7)] onto
the slave side of a pseudo terminal \s-1STREAM\s+1, before the \f4ldterm\f1
module is pushed.
.PP
On the write-side, the \f4TCSETA, TCSETAF, TCSETAW, TCGETA, TCSETS, TCSETSW,
TCSETSF, TCGETS,
TCSBRK, JWINSIZE, TIOCGWINSZ\fP, and \f4TIOCSWINSZ\fP
\f4termio ioctl\fP(2) messages are processed and acknowledged.
A hang up (such as stty 0) is converted to a zero length \f4M_DATA\fP message
and passed downstream.
Termio \f4cflags\f1 and window row and column information are stored locally 
one per stream.
\f4M_DELAY\fP messages are discarded.
All other messages are passed downstream unmodified.
.PP
On the read-side all messages are passed upstream unmodified with the
following exceptions.
All \f4M_READ\fP and \f4M_DELAY\fP messages are freed in both directions.
An \f4ioctl TCSBRK\fP is converted to an \f4M_BREAK\fP message and 
passed upstream and an acknowledgement is returned downstream.
An \f4ioctl TIOCSIGNAL\fP is converted into an \f4M_PCSIG\fP message, 
and passed upstream and an acknowledgement is returned downstream.
Finally an \f4ioctl TIOCREMOTE\fP is converted into an \f4M_CTL\fP
message, acknowledged, and passed upstream.

.SH NAME
\f4SA\f1 \- devices administered by System Administration
.SH DESCRIPTION
The files in the directories \f4/dev/SA\f1 (for block devices)
and the \f4/dev/rSA\f1 (for raw devices) are used by System
Administration to access the devices on which it operates.
For devices that support more than one partition (like disks)
the \f4/dev/(r)SA\f1 entry is linked to the partition that spans
the entire device.
Not all \f4/dev/(r)SA\f1 entries are used by all System
Administration commands.

.SH NAME
\f4mem\f1, \f4kmem\f1 \- core memory
.SH DESCRIPTION
The file
\f4/dev/mem\fP
is a special file that is an image of the core memory
of the computer.
It may be used, for example, to examine,
and even to patch the system.
.PP
Byte addresses in
\f4/dev/mem\fP
are interpreted as memory addresses.
References to non-existent locations cause errors to be returned.
.PP
Examining and patching device registers is likely
to lead to unexpected results when read-only or write-only
bits are present.
.PP
The file
\f4/dev/kmem\fP
is the same as 
\f4/dev/mem\fP
except that kernel virtual memory
rather than physical memory is accessed.
.SH FILES
\f4/dev/mem
.br
/dev/kmem\fP
.SH NOTES
Some of \f4/dev/kmem\f1 cannot be read because
of write-only addresses or unequipped memory addresses.

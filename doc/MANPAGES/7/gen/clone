.SH "NAME"
\f4clone\f1 \- open any major/minor device pair on a \s-1STREAMS\s0 driver
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\f4clone\fP is a \s-1STREAMS\s0 software driver that finds and opens an
unused major/minor device on another \s-1STREAMS\s0 driver.
The major device number passed to \f4clone\fP during open corresponds to the 
\f4clone\fP driver and the minor device number corresponds to the target driver.
Each open results in a separate stream to a previously
unused major/minor device.
.P
The \f4clone\fP driver consists solely of an open function.
This open function performs all of the necessary work so that subsequent system calls 
[including \f4close\fP(2)] require no further involvement of \f4clone\fP.
.P
\f4clone\fP will generate an \s-1ENXIO\s+1 error, without opening the device, if the 
major/minor device number provided does not correspond to a valid major/minor device, or if the driver indicated is not a \s-1STREAMS\s0 driver.

.SH "NOTES"
Multiple opens of the same major/minor device cannot be done through the \f4clone\fP 
interface.
Executing \f4stat\fP(2) on the file system node for a cloned device yields a
different result from executing \f4fstat\fP(2) using a file descriptor obtained
from opening the node.

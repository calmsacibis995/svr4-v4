.SH NAME
\f4sxt\f1 \- pseudo-device driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
The special file
\f4/dev/sxt\fP
is a pseudo-device driver that interposes a discipline between the standard
\f4tty\fP
line disciplines and a real device driver.
The standard disciplines manipulate
virtual tty
structures (channels) declared by the
\f4/dev/sxt\fP
driver.
\f4/dev/sxt\fP
acts as a discipline manipulating a 
real tty
structure declared by a real device driver.
The
\f4/dev/sxt\fP
driver is currently only used by the
\f4shl\fP(1)
command.
.P
Virtual ttys 
are named by inodes in the subdirectory \f4/dev/sxt\fP
and are allocated in groups of up to eight.
To allocate a group, a program should exclusively open a file with a name
of the form \f4/dev/sxt/??0\fP (channel 0) and then execute 
a \f4SXTIOCLINK ioctl\fP
call to initiate the multiplexing.
.P
Only one channel, the 
controlling channel,
can receive input from the keyboard at a time; 
others attempting to read will be blocked.
.P
There are two groups of
\f4ioctl\fP(2)
commands supported by
\f4sxt\fP.
The first group contains the standard
\f4ioctl\fP
commands described in
\f4termio\fP(7),
with the addition of the following:
.TP 20
\f4TIOCEXCL\fP
Set
exclusive use
mode: no further opens are permitted until the file has been closed.
.TP
\f4TIOCNXCL\fP
Reset
exclusive use
mode: further opens are once again permitted.
.P
The second group are commands to 
\f4sxt\fP
itself.
Some of these may only be executed on channel 0.
.TP 20
\f4SXTIOCLINK\fP
Allocate a channel group
and multiplex the virtual ttys onto the real tty.
The argument is the number of channels to allocate.
This command may only be executed on channel 0.
Possible errors include:
.RS 20
.TP 10
\f4EINVAL\fP
The argument is out of range.
.TP
\f4ENOTTY\fP
The command was not issued from a real tty.
.TP
\f4ENXIO\fP
\f4linesw\fP
is not configured with
\f4sxt\fP.
.TP
\f4EBUSY\fP
An
\f4SXTIOCLINK\fP
command has already been issued for this real \f4tty\fP.
.TP
\f4ENOMEM\fP
There is no system memory available for allocating the virtual tty structures.
.TP
\f4EBADF\fP
Channel 0 was not opened before this call.
.RE
.TP 20
\f4SXTIOCSWTCH\fP
Set the controlling channel.
Possible errors include:
.RS 20
.TP 10
\f4EINVAL\fP
An invalid channel number was given.
.TP
\f4EPERM\fP
The command was not executed from channel 0.
.RE
.br
.ne 5
.TP 20
\f4SXTIOCWF\fP
Cause a channel to wait until it is the controlling channel.
This command will return the error, \f4EINVAL\f1, if
an invalid channel number is given.
.TP
\f4SXTIOCUBLK\fP
Turn off the \f4loblk\f1 control flag in the
virtual tty of the indicated channel.
The error \f4EINVAL\f1 will be returned if an
invalid number or channel 0 is given.
.TP
\f4SXTIOCSTAT\fP
Get the status (blocked on input or output)
of each channel and store in the \f4sxtblock\f1
structure referenced by the argument.
The error \f4EFAULT\f1 will be returned
if the structure cannot be written.
.TP
\f4SXTIOCTRACE\fP
Enable tracing.
Tracing information is written to 
the console on the 3B2 Computer.
This command has no effect if tracing is not configured.
.TP
\f4SXTIOCNOTRACE\fP
Disable tracing.
This command has no effect if tracing is not configured.

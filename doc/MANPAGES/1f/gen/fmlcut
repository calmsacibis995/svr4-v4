.SH NAME
\f4fmlcut\f1 \- cut out selected fields of each line of a file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4fmlcut\f1 \f4\-c\f2\^list\f1 [\|\f2file\f1 .\ .\ .]
.br
\f4fmlcut\f1 \f4\-f\f2\^list\f1 [\f4\-d\f2\|char\|\f1] [\f4\-s\f1] [\|\f2file\f1 .\ .\ .]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4fmlcut\f1 function
cuts out columns from a table or fields from each line in \f2file\f1;
in database parlance, it implements the projection of a relation.
\f4fmlcut\f1
can be used as a filter;
if\f2 file\f1 is not specified or is \f4-\f1, the standard input is read.
\f2list\f1 specifies the fields to be selected.
Fields can be fixed length (character positions) or variable length (separated
by a field delimiter character),
depending on whether \f4-c\f1 or \f4-f\f1 is specified.
.PP
Note that either the
\f4\-c\f1
or the
\f4\-f\f1
option must be specified.
.PP
The meanings of the options are:
.br
.TP "\w'\-d\ char\ \ 'u"
\f2list\f1
A comma-separated list of integer field numbers (in increasing order),
with optional \f4\-\fP to indicate ranges
For example:
\f41,4,7\f1;
\f41\-3,8\f1;
\f4\-5,10\f1
(short for \f41\-5,10\f1);
or
\f43\-\f1
(short for third through last field).
.TP
\f4\-c\fP\^\f2list\fP
If \f4-c\f1 is specified, \f2list\f1
specifies character positions (for example,
\f4\-c1\-72\f1
would pass the first 72 characters of each line).
Note that no space intervenes between \f4-c\f1 and \f2list\f1.
.TP
\f4\-f\^\f2list\f1
If \f4-f\f1 is specified,  \f2list\f1
is a list of fields assumed to be separated in the file
by the default delimiter character, \f4TAB\f1, or by \f2char\f1 if
the \f4-d\f1 option is specified.
For example,
\f4\-f1,7\f1
copies the first and seventh field only.
Lines with no delimiter characters are passed through intact
(useful for table subheadings), unless
\f4\-s\f1
is specified.
Note that no space intervenes between \f4-f\f1 and \f2list\f1.
The following options can be used if you have specified \f4-f\f1.
.RS .5i
.TP .5i
\f4\-d\fP\^\f2char\fP
If
\f4\-d\f1 is specified,
\f2char\f1 is the field delimiter.
Space or other characters with special meaning to FMLI
must be quoted.
Note that no space intervenes between \f4-d\f1 and \f2char\f1.
The default field delimiter is \f4TAB\f1.
.TP
\f4\-s\f1
Suppresses lines with no delimiter characters.
If \f4\-s\f1 is not specified,
lines with no delimiters will be passed through untouched.
.RE
.SH EXAMPLES
\f4fmlcut \-d: \-f1,5 /etc/passwd\f1	gets login IDs and names
.sp
\f4\(gawho am i | fmlcut \-f1 \-d" "\(ga\f1	gets the current login name
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
\f4fmlcut\f1 returns the following exit values:
.sp
0   when the selected field is successfully cut out
.br
2   on syntax errors
.sp
.PP
The following error messages may be displayed on the FMLI message line:
.TP 1i
\f4ERROR:  line too long\f1
A line has more than 1023 characters or fields,
or there is no new-line character.
.TP
\f4ERROR:  bad list for c\|/\|f option\f1
Missing \f4\-c\f1 or \f4\-f\f1
option or incorrectly specified \f2list\f1.
No error occurs if a line has fewer fields than the \f2list\f1
calls for.
.TP
\f4ERROR:  no fields\f1
The \f2list\f1 is empty.
.TP
\f4ERROR:  no delimiter\f1
Missing
\f2char\f1
on
\f4\-d\f1
option.
.SH NOTES
\f4fmlcut\f1 cannot correctly process
lines longer than 1023 characters, or lines
with no newline character.

.SH NAME
\f4readfile\f1, \f4longline\f1 \- reads file, gets longest line
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4readfile\f1
\f2file\f1
.sp .4v
\f4longline\f1
[\f2file\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4readfile\f1 function reads \f2file\f1 and copies it to \f2stdout\f1.
No translation of NEWLINE is done.
It keeps track of the longest line it reads
and if there is a subsequent call to \f4longline\f1,
the length of that line, including the NEWLINE character, is returned.
.PP
The \f4longline\f1 function returns the length, including the NEWLINE
character, of the longest line in \f2file\f1.
If \f2file\f1 is not specified, it uses the file named in the last call
to \f4readfile\f1.
.SH EXAMPLES
Here is a typical use of \f4readfile\f1
and \f4longline\f1 in a text frame definition file:
.PP
.RS
.nf
   \&.
   \&.
   \&.
\f4text="\(gareadfile myfile\(ga"
columns=\(galongline\(ga\f1
   \&.
   \&.
   \&.
.fi
.RE
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
If \f2file\f1 does not exist, \f4readfile\f1 will return FALSE
(that is, the expression will have an error return).
.PP
\f4longline\f1 returns 0 if a \f4readfile\f1 has not previously
been issued.
.SH NOTES
More than one descriptor can call
\f4readfile\f1 in the same frame definition file.
In text frames, if one of those calls is made from the
\f4text\f1 descriptor,
then a subsequent use of \f4longline\f1
will always get the longest line of the file read by the
\f4readfile\f1 associated with the \f4text\f1 descriptor,
even if it was not the most recent use of \f4readfile\f1.

.SH NAME
\f4set\f1, \f4unset\f1 \- set and unset local or global environment variables
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4set\f1 [ \f4-l\f1 \f2variable\f1[\f4=\f2value\f1 ] ] . . .
.br
\f4set\f1 [ \f4-e\f1 \f2variable\f1[\f4=\f2value\f1 ] ] . . .
.br
\f4set\f1 [ \f4-f\f2file\f1 \f2variable\f1[\f4=\f2value\f1 ] ] . . .
.P
\f4unset \f4-l\f1 \f2variable\f1 . . .
.br
\f4unset \-f\f2file variable\f1 . . .
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4set\f1 command sets \f2variable\f1
in the environment, or adds \f2variable\f4=\f2value\f1 to \f2file\f1.
If \f2variable\f1 is not equated it to a value,
\f4set\f1 expects the value to be on standard input.
The \f4unset\f1 command removes \f2variable\f1.
Note that the FMLI predefined, read-only variables (such as \f4ARG1\f1),
may not be set or unset.
.PP
FMLI inherits the UNIX environment when invoked:
.TP "\w'\-ffile\ \ 'u"
\f4\-l\f1
sets or unsets the specified variable in the local environment.
Variables set with \f4-l\f1 will not be inherited by processes invoked
from FMLI.
.TP
\f4\-e\f1
sets the specified variable in the UNIX environment.
Variables set with \f4-e\f1 will be inherited by any processes started
from FMLI.
Note that these variables cannot be \f4unset\f1.
.TP
\f4-f\f2file\f1
sets or unsets the specified variable in the global environment.
The argument \f2file\f1 is the name, or pathname, of a file
containing lines of the form \f2variable\f4=\f2value\f1.
\f2file\f1 will be created if it does not already exist.
Note that no space intervenes between \f4\-f\f1 and \f2file\f1.
.PP
Note that at least one of the above options must be used for each
variable being set or unset.
If you set a variable with the \f4\-f\f2filename\f1 option,
you must thereafter include \f2filename\f1 in references to that variable.
For example, \f4${(\f2file\f4)\f2VARIABLE\f4}\f1.
.SH EXAMPLE
Storing a selection made in a menu:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\f4name=Selection 2
action=\(gaset \-l SELECTION=2\(gaclose\f1
.fi
.RE
.SH NOTES
Variables set to be available to the UNIX environment
(those set using the \f4\-e\f1 option)
can only be set for the current \f4fmli\fP process
and the processes it calls.
.PP
When using the \f4\-f\f1 option,
unless \f2file\f1 is unique to the process,
other users of FMLI on the same machine
will be able to expand these variables,
depending on the read/write permissions on \f2file\f1.
.PP
A variable set in one frame may be referenced or unset in any other frame.
This includes local variables.

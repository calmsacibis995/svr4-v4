\f4sleep\f1 \- suspend execution for interval

.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4sleep\f1
suspends the current process from execution for the
number
of seconds specified by the argument.
The actual suspension time may be
up to 1 second less than that requested, because scheduled wakeups occur
at fixed 1-second intervals, and may be an arbitrary amount longer because of
other activity in the system.
.P
\f4sleep\f1
is implemented by setting an interval timer and pausing
until it expires.
The previous state of this timer is saved and restored.
If the sleep time exceeds the time to the expiration of the
previous value of the timer, the process sleeps
only until the timer would have expired, and the
signal which occurs with the expiration
of the timer is sent one second later.

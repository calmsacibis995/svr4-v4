.SH NAME
\f4timezone\f1 \- get time zone name given offset from GMT
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4cc \f1[ \f2flag\f1\. \. \. ] \f2file\f1 \. \. \. \f4\-lucb\f1
.P
\f4char *timezone(zone, dst)\f1
.P
\f4int zone\f1
.br
\f4int dst\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4timezone\f1
attempts to return the name of the time zone
associated with its first argument, which is
measured in minutes westward from Greenwich.
If the second argument is 0, the standard name is used,
otherwise the Daylight Savings Time version.
If the required name does not appear in a table
built into the routine, the difference from
.SM GMT
is produced; for instance, in Afghanistan
\f4timezone(\-(60*4+30), 0)\f1
is appropriate because it is 4:30 ahead of
.SM GMT
and the string
\f4GMT+4:30\f1
is produced.
.SH SEE ALSO
\f4ctime\fP(3)
in the \f2Programmer's Reference Manual\f1
.SH NOTES
The offset westward from Greenwich and an
indication of whether Daylight Savings Time
is in effect may not be
sufficient to determine the name of the time zone,
as the name may differ between different locations
in the same time zone.
Instead of using
\f4timezone\f1
to determine the name of the time zone for
a given time, that time should be converted to a
\f4struct tm\f1 using \f4localtime\f1
[see \f4ctime\f1(3)]
and the \f4tm_zone\fP
field of that structure should be used.
\f4timezone\f1 is retained for compatibility with existing programs.

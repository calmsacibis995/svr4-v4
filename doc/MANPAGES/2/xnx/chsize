.SH NAME
\f4chsize\f1 \- change the size of a file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4cc \f1[\f2flag \f1. . .] \f2file\f1 . . . \f4-lx\f1
.br
\f4int chsize (int fildes, long size);\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f2fildes\f1
is a file descriptor obtained from a
\f4create\f1,
\f4open\f1,
\f4dup\f1,
\f4fcntl\f1,
or
\f4pipe\f1
system call.
\f4chsize\f1
changes the size of the file associated with
the file descriptor
\f2fildes\f1
to be exactly
\f2size\f1
bytes in length.
The routine either truncates the file,
or pads it with an appropriate number of bytes.
If
\f2size\f1
is less than the initial size of the file,
then all allocated disk blocks between
\f2size\f1
and the initial file size are freed.
.P
The maximum file size as set by
\f4ulimit\f1(2)
is enforced when
\f4chsize\f1
is called,
rather than on subsequent writes.
Thus
\f4chsize\f1
fails, and the file size remains unchanged
if the new changed file size would exceed
the 
\f4ulimit\f1.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Upon successful completion, a value of \f40\f1 is returned.
Otherwise, the value \f4\-1\f1 is returned and
\f4errno\f1
is set to indicate the error.
.SH SEE ALSO
\f4creat\f1(2),
\f4dup\f1(2),
\f4lseek\f1(2),
\f4open\f1(2),
\f4pipe\f1(2),
\f4ulimit\f1(2)
.SH NOTES
In general if
\f4chsize\f1
is used to expand the size of a file,
when data is written to the end of the file,
intervening blocks are filled with zeros.
In a some cases, reducing the file size may not remove
the data beyond the new end-of-file.

.SH NAME
\f4nap\f1 \- suspend execution for a short interval
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4cc \f1[\f2flag \f1. . .] \f2file\f1 . . . \f4-lx\f1
.br
\f4long nap (long period);\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
The current process is suspended from execution for at
least the number of milliseconds specified by \f2period\f1,
or until a signal is received.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
On successful completion,
a long integer indicating the number of milliseconds actually
slept is returned.
If the process received a signal while napping,
the return value will be
\f4\-1\f1, and
\f4errno\f1
will be set to
\f4EINTR\f1.
.SH SEE ALSO
\f4sleep\f1(2)
.SH NOTES
This function is driven by the system clock,
which in most cases has a granularity of
tens of milliseconds.

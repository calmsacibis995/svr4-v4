.SH NAME
\f4sdgetv\f1 \- synchronize shared data access
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4cc \f1[\f2flag \f1. . .] \f2file\f1 . . . \f4-lx\f1
.PP
\f4#include <sys/sd.h>\f1
.PP
\f4int sdgetv(addr)
.PP
\f4int sdwaitv(char *addr, int vnum);\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4sdgetv\fP and \f4sdwaitv\fP may be used to synchronize cooperating
processes that are using shared data segments.
The return value of
both routines is the version number of the shared data segment attached
to the process at address \f2addr\f1.
The version number of a
segment changes whenever some process does an \f4sdleave\fP for that
segment.
.P
\f4sdgetv\fP simply returns the version number of the indicated segment.
.P
\f4sdwaitv\fP forces the current process to sleep until the version
number for the indicated segment is no longer equal to \f2vnum\f1.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Upon successful completion, both \f4sdgetv\fP and \f4sdwaitv\fP return
a positive integer that is the current version number for the indicated
shared data segment.
Otherwise, a value of \-1 is returned, and
\f4errno\f1 is set to indicate the error.

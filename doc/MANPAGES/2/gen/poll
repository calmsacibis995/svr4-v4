.SH NAME
\f4poll\f1 \- input/output multiplexing
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\f4#include <stropts.h>
#include <poll.h>
   
int poll(struct poll *fds, size_t nfds, int timeout);\f1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4poll\fP provides users with a mechanism for multiplexing input/output
over a set of file descriptors that reference open files.
\f4poll\fP identifies those files on which a user can send or
receive messages, or on which certain events have occurred.
.P
\f2fds\f1 specifies the file descriptors to be examined and the 
events of interest for each file descriptor.
It is a pointer to an array with one element for each
open file descriptor of interest.
The array's elements are \f4pollfd\f1 structures, which contain
the following members:
.P
.RS
.ta 1.75i
.nf
.ft 4
int fd;	/* file descriptor */
short events;	/* requested events */
short revents;	/* returned events */
.ft 1

.RE
.P
\f4fd\f1 specifies an open file descriptor and
\f4events\f1 and \f4revents\f1 are bitmasks constructed by an OR of
any combination of the following event flags:
.TP 15
\f4POLLIN\fP
Data other than high priority data may be read without blocking.
For \s-1STREAMS\s0, this flag is set even if the message is of zero length.
.TP
\f4POLLRDNORM\fP
Normal data (priority band = 0) may be read without blocking.
For \s-1STREAMS\s0, this flag is set even if the message is of zero length.
.TP
\f4POLLRDBAND\fP
Data from a non-zero priority band may be read without blocking
For \s-1STREAMS\s0, this flag is set even if the message is of zero length.
.TP
\f4POLLPRI\fP
High priority data may be received without blocking.
For \s-1STREAMS\s0, this flag is set even if the message is of zero length.
.TP
\f4POLLOUT\fP
Normal data may be written without blocking.
.TP
\f4POLLWRNORM\fP
The same as \f4POLLOUT\fP.
.TP
\f4POLLWRBAND\fP
Priority data (priority band > 0) may be written.
This event only examines bands that have been written to at least once.
.TP
\f4POLLERR\fP
An error has occurred on the device or stream.
This flag is only valid in the \f4revents\f1 bitmask;
it is not used in the \f4events\f1 field.
.TP
\f4POLLHUP\fP
A hangup has occurred on the stream.
This event and \f4POLLOUT\fP are mutually exclusive;
a stream can never be writable if a hangup has occurred.
However, this event and \f4POLLIN, POLLRDNORM, POLLRDBAND\fP, or \f4POLLPRI\fP 
are not mutually exclusive.
This flag is only valid in the \f4revents\f1 bitmask;
it is not used in the \f4events\f1 field.
.TP
\f4POLLNVAL\fP
The specified \f4fd\f1 value does not belong to an open file.
This flag is only valid in the \f4revents\f1 field;
it is not used in the \f4events\f1 field.
.PP
For each element of the array pointed to by \f2fds\f1,
\f4poll\fP examines the given file descriptor for the
event(s) specified in \f4events\f1.
The number of file descriptors to be examined is specified by \f2nfds\f1.
.PP
If the value \f4fd\f1 is less than zero, \f4events\f1 is ignored and \f4revents\f1
is set to 0 in that entry on return from \f4poll\fP .
.P
The results of the \f4poll\fP query are stored in the
\f4revents\f1 field in the \f4pollfd\f1 structure.
Bits are set in the \f4revents\f1 bitmask to indicate
which of the requested events are true.
If none are true, none of the specified bits are
set in \f4revents\f1 when the \f4poll\fP call returns.
The event flags \f4POLLHUP\fP, \f4POLLERR\fP, and \f4POLLNVAL\fP are always 
set in \f4revents\f1 if the conditions they indicate are true; this
occurs even though these flags were not present in \f4events\f1.
.P
If none of the defined events have occurred on any selected file descriptor,
\f4poll\fP waits at least \f2timeout\f1 milliseconds for an event to occur
on any of the selected file descriptors.
On a computer where millisecond timing accuracy is not available,
\f2timeout\f1 is rounded up to the nearest legal value available
on that system.
If the value \f2timeout\f1 is 0, \f4poll\fP returns immediately.
If the value of \f2timeout\f1 is \f4INFTIM\fP (or \-1),
\f4poll\fP blocks until a requested event occurs or
until the call is interrupted.
\f4poll\fP is not affected by the \f4O_NDELAY\fP and \f4O_NONBLOCK\fP flags.
.P
\f4poll\fP fails if one or more of the following are true:
.TP 15
\f4EAGAIN\fP
Allocation of internal data structures failed, but the request may
be attempted again.
.TP
\f4EFAULT\fP
Some argument points outside the allocated address space.
.TP
\f4EINTR\fP
A signal was caught during the \f4poll\fP system call.
.TP
\f4EINVAL\fP
The argument \f2nfds\f1 is greater than \f4{OPEN_MAX}\fP.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Upon successful completion,
a non-negative value is returned.
A positive value indicates the total number of file descriptors
that has been selected
(that is, file descriptors for which the \f4revents\f1 field is
non-zero).
A value of 0 indicates that
the call timed out and no file descriptors have been selected.
Upon failure, a value of \-1 is returned and \f4errno\f1
is set to indicate the error.

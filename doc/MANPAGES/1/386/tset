.SH NAME
\f4tset\f1 \- provide information to set terminal modes
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4tset\f1
[\f2options\f1]
[\f2type\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4tset\f1
allows the user to set a terminal's ERASE and KILL characters,
and define the terminal's type and capabilities by creating
values for the TERM environment variable.
\f4tset\f1
initializes or resets the terminal with \f4tput\fP
[see \f4tput\f1(1)].
If a \f2type\fP
is given with the
\f4\-s\f1
option,
\f4tset\f1
creates information for a terminal of the specified type.
The type may be any type given in
the \f4terminfo\f1 database.
If the \f2type\fP
is not specified with the
\f4\-s\f1
option,
\f4tset\f1
creates information for a terminal of the type
defined by the value of the \f4TERM\f1
environment variable, unless the
\f4\-h\f1
or
\f4\-m\f1
option is given.
If the \f4TERM\f1 variable is defined, \f4tset\f1
uses the \f4terminfo\f1 database entry.
If these options are used,
\f4tset\f1
searches the
\f4/etc/ttytype\f1
file for the terminal type corresponding to the
current serial port; it then creates information for
a terminal based on this type.
If the serial port is not found in \f4/etc/ttytype\f1,
the terminal type is set to \f4unknown\f1.
.PP
\f4tset\f1
displays the created information on the standard output.
The information is in a form that can be used to
set the current environment variables.
The exact form depends on the login shell from which \f4tset\f1
was invoked.
The examples below illustrate how to use
this information to change the variables.
.PP
The options are:
.PP
.TP
\f4\-e\f1[\f2c\^\f1]
Sets the ERASE character to \f2c\f1
on all terminals.
The default setting is the BACKSPACE,
or CTRL-h.
.TP
\f4\-E\f1[\f2c\^\f1]
Identical to the
\f4\-e\f1
command except that it only operates on terminals that can BACKSPACE.
.TP
\f4\-k\f1[\f2c\^\f1]
Sets the KILL character to \f2c\f1,
defaulting to CTRL-u.
.TP
\f4\-\f1
Prints the terminal type on the standard output.
.TP
\f4\-s\f1
Outputs the ``setenv'' commands [for
\f4csh\f1(1)],
or ``export'' and assignment commands
[for
\f4sh\f1(1)].
The type of commands are determined by the user's login shell.
.TP
\f4\-h\f1
Forces \f4tset\f1\^ to search \f4/etc/ttytype\f1 for
information and to overlook the \f4TERM\f1 environment variable,
.TP
\f4\-S\f1
Only outputs the strings to be placed in the
environment variables, without the shell commands printed for \f4\-S\f1.
.TP
\f4\-r\f1
Prints the terminal type on the diagnostic output.
.TP
\f4\-Q\f1
Suppresses the printing of the \f4Erase set to\fP and \f4Kill set to\fP
messages.
.TP
\f4\-I\f1
Suppresses printing of the terminal initialization strings, e.g., spawns
\f4tput reset\f1 instead of \f4tput init\f1.
.TP
\f4\-m\f1[\f2ident\f1][\f2test baudrate\f1]:\f2type\f1
Allows a user to specify how a given serial port is
is to be mapped to an actual terminal type.
The option applies to any serial port in
\f4/etc/ttytype\f1
whose type is indeterminate (e.g.,
\f4dialup\f1,
\f4plugboard\f1,
etc.).
The
.I type
specifies the terminal type to be used,
and
.I ident
identifies the name of the indeterminate type to be matched.
If no
.I ident
is given, all indeterminate types are matched.
The
.I test\ baudrate
defines a test to be performed on the serial port
before the type is assigned.
The
.I baudrate
must be as defined in \f4stty\fP
[see \f4stty\f1(1)].
The
.I test\^
may be any combination of:\0\0>, =, <, @, and !.
If the
.I type
begins with a question mark, the user is asked if he
really wants that type.
A null response means to use that type;
otherwise, another type can be entered which will be used instead.
The question mark must be escaped to prevent filename
expansion by the shell.
If more than one
\f4\-m\f1
option is given, the first correct mapping prevails.
.PP
\f4tset\f1
is most useful when included in the
\f4\&.login\f1
[for
\f4csh\f1(1)]
or
\f4\&.profile\f1
[for
\f4sh\f1(1)]
file executed automatically at login,
with
\f4\-m\f1
mapping used to specify the terminal type
you most frequently dial in on.
.SH EXAMPLES
\f4tset gt42\f1
.PP
\f4tset \-mdialup\e>300:adm3a \-mdialup:dw2 \-Qr \-e#\f1
.PP
\f4tset \-m dial:ti733 \-m plug:\e?hp2621 \-m unknown:\e? \-e \-k^U\f1
.PP
To use the information created by the
\f4\-s\f1
option for the Bourne shell, (\f4sh\f1),
repeat these commands:
.PP
.nf
	\f4tset \-s ... > /tmp/tset$$
	/tmp/tset$$
	rm /tmp/tset$$\f1
.fi
.PP
To use the information created for \f4csh\f1,
use:
.PP
.nf
	\f4set noglob
	set term=(`tset \-S ....`)
	setenv \s-1TERM\s0 $term[1]
	unset term
	unset noglob\f1
.fi

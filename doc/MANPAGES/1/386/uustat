.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4uustat\fP
functions in the following three areas:
displays the general status of, or cancels, previously specified
\f4uucp\fP
commands; provides remote system performance information, in terms
of average transfer rates or average queue times;
provides general remote system-specific and user-specific status of
\f4uucp\fP
connections to other systems.
.PP
Here are the options that obtain general status of, or
cancel, previously specified \f4uucp\fP commands; \f4uustat\fP allows
only one of these options to appear on each \f4uustat\fP command line
execution:
.TP 10
\f4\-a\^\f1
List all jobs in queue.
.TP
\f4\-j\^\f1
List the total number of jobs displayed.  The \f4\-j\f1 option must be used
in conjunction with the \f4\-a\f1 or the \f4\-s\f1 option.
.TP
\f4\-k\f2jobid\^\f1
Kill the
\f4uucp\fP
request whose job identification is
.IR jobid .
The killed
\f4uucp\fP
request must belong to the person
issuing the
\f4uustat\fP
command
unless one is the super-user or uucp administrator.
If the job is killed by the super-user or uucp administrator, electronic
mail is sent to the user.
.TP
\f4\-m\^\f1
Report the status of accessibility of all machines.
.TP
\f4\-n\f1
Suppress all standard out output, but not standard error.  The \f4\-n\f1
option is used in conjunction with the \f4\-k\f1 and \f4\-r\f1 options.
.TP
\f4\-p\^\f1
Execute the command \f(CWps \-flp\f1 for all the process-ids that are in
the lock files.
.TP
\f4\-q\^\f1
List the jobs queued for each machine.
If a status file exists for the machine, its date, time and
status information are reported.
In addition, if a number appears in parentheses next to the number of \f4C\f1 or \f4X\f1
files, it is the age in days of the oldest \f4C.\f1/\f4X.\f1 file for that system.
The \f5Retry\f1 field represents the number of hours until the next possible call.
The \f5Count\f1 is the number of failure attempts.
NOTE: for systems with a moderate number of outstanding jobs, this
could take 30 seconds or more of real-time to execute.
Here is an example of the output produced by the
\f4\-q\f1
option:
.nf
.IP "" 12
.ta .75i 1.15i 2.0i
.ft 5
eagle	3C	04/07-11:07   NO DEVICES AVAILABLE
mh3bs3	2C	07/07-10:42   SUCCESSFUL
.ft 1
.fi
.IP "" 10
The above output tells how many command files are waiting for each system.
Each command file may have zero or more files to be sent (zero means to call
the system and see if work is to be done).
The date and time refer to the previous interaction
with the system followed by the status of the interaction.
.TP
\f4\-r\f2jobid\^\f1
Rejuvenate
.IR jobid\^ .
The files associated with
.I jobid\^
are touched so that 
their modification time is set to the current time.
This prevents the cleanup daemon
from deleting the job until the jobs' modification
time reaches the limit imposed by the daemon.
.PP
Here are the options that provide remote system performance
information, in terms of average transfer rates or average queue times;
the \f4\-c\f1 and \f4\-d\f1 options can only be used in conjunction with
the \f4\-t\f1 option:
.PP
.TP 10
\f4\-t\f2system\^\f1
Report the average transfer rate or average queue time for the past
60 minutes for the remote
.IR system .
The following parameters can only be used with this option:
.TP
\f4\-d\f2number\f1
.I number
is specified in minutes.
Used to override the 60 minute default used for calculations.
These calculations are based on information contained in the
optional performance log and therefore may not be available.
Calculations can only be made from the time that the performance 
log was last cleaned up.
.TP
\f4\-c\f1
Average queue time is calculated when the \f4\-c\f1 parameter is specified
and average transfer rate when \f4\-c\f1 is not specified.
For example, the command
.IP "" 12
\f4uustat \-teagle \-d50 \-c\f1
.IP "" 10
produces output in the following format:
.IP "" 12
.ft 5
.ps -1
average queue time to eagle for last 50 minutes: 5 seconds
.ps
.ft 1
.IP "" 10
The same command without the \f4\-c\f1 parameter
produces output in the following format:
.IP "" 12
.ft 5
.ps -1
average transfer rate with eagle for last 50 minutes: 2000.88 bytes/sec
.ps
.ft 1
.PP
Here are the options that provide general remote system-specific and
user-specific status of
\f4uucp\fP
connections to other systems.  Either or both of the following options
can be specified with
.IR uustat.
The \f4\-j\f1 option can be used in conjunction with the \f4\-s\f1
option to list the total number of jobs displayed:
.PP
.TP 10
\f4\-s\f2system\^\f1
Report the status of all
\f4uucp\fP
requests for remote system \f2system.\f1
.TP
\f4\-u\f2user\^\f1
Report the status of all
\f4uucp\fP
requests issued by
.IR user .
.PP
Output for both the
\f4\-s\f1
and
\f4\-u\f1
options has the following format:
.PP
.ft 5
.nf
eagleN1bd7  4/07-11:07  S  eagle  dan  522    /home/dan/A 
eagleC1bd8  4/07-11:07  S  eagle  dan   59    D.3b2al2ce4924
            4/07-11:07  S  eagle  dan  rmail  mike
.fi
.ft 1
.PP
With the above two options,
the first field
is the
.I jobid
of the job.
This is followed by the date/time.
The next field is an \f5S\f1 if the job is sending a file
or an \f5R\f1 if the job is requesting a file.
The next field is the machine where the file is to be transferred.
This is followed by the user-id of the user who queued the job.
The next field contains the size of the file,
or in the case of a remote execution
(\f4rmail\fP is the command used for remote mail),
the name of the command.
When the size appears in this field,
the file name is also given.
This can either be the name given by the user or an
internal name (e.g., \f5D.3b2alce4924\f1)
that is created for data files associated with remote executions
(\f5rmail\f1
in this example).
.TP 10
\f4\-S\f2qric\^\f1
Report the job state: \f5q\f1 for queued jobs, \f5r\f1 for running jobs, \f5i\f1 for
interrupted jobs, and \f5c\f1 for completed jobs.
.IP ""
A job is queued if the transfer has not started.
A job is running when the transfer has begun.  A job is interrupted
if the transfer began but was terminated before the file was completely 
transferred.
A completed job, of course, is a job that successfully transferred.
The completed state information is maintained in the accounting log, 
which is optional and therefore may be unavailable.
The parameters can be used in any combination, but at least one parameter
must be specified.
The \f4\-S\f1 option can also be used with \f4\-s\f1 and \f4\-u\f1 options.
The output for this option is exactly like the output for \f4\-s\f1 and
\f4\-u\f1 except that the job states are appended as the last output word.
Output for a completed job has the following format:
.IP "" 12
.ft 5
eagleC1bd3 completed
.ft 1
.PP
When no options are given,
\f4uustat\fP
outputs the status of all
\f4uucp\fP
requests issued by the current user.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The \f4\-t\f1 option produces no message when the data needed for the
calculations is not being recorded.
.SH NOTES
After the user has issued the \f4uucp\f1 request, if the file to be transferred
is moved or deleted or was not copied to the spool directory with the
\f4\-C\f1 option when the \f4uucp\f1 request was made ,\f4uustat\f1 reports a file
size of \-99999.
This job will eventually fail because the file(s) to be transferred can
not be found.

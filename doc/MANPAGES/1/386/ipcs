.SH NAME
\f4ipcs\f1 \- report inter-process communication facilities status
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4ipcs\f1
[
.I options
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4ipcs\fP
prints information about active inter-process communication facilities.
Without
.IR options ,
information is printed in short format for message queues,
shared memory,
and semaphores that are currently active in the system.
Otherwise, the information that is displayed is controlled
by the following
.IR options :
.TP
\f4\-q\f1
Print information about active message queues.
.TP
\f4\-m\f1
Print information about active shared memory segments.
.TP
\f4\-s\f1
Print information about active semaphores.
.PP
If
\f4\-q\f1,
\f4\-m\f1,
or
\f4\-s\f1
are specified,
information about only those indicated is printed.
If none of these three are specified,
information about all three is printed subject to these options:
.TP
\f4\-b\f1
Print information on biggest allowable size:
maximum number of bytes in messages on queue for message queues,
size of segments for shared memory,
and number of semaphores in each set for semaphores.
See below for meaning of columns in a listing.
.TP
\f4\-c\f1
Print creator's login name and group name.
See below.
.TP
\f4\-o\f1
Print information on outstanding usage:
number of messages on queue and total number of bytes in messages on queue for
message queues and number of processes attached to shared memory segments.
.TP
\f4\-p\f1
Print process number information:
process
.SM ID
of last process to send a message,
process
.SM ID
of last process to receive a message on message queues,
process
.SM ID
of creating process, and process
.SM ID
of last process to attach or detach on shared memory segments.
See below.
.TP
\f4\-t\f1
Print time information:
time of the last control operation that changed the access permissions for
all facilities,
time of last
\f4msgsnd\fP
and last
\f4msgrcv\fP
on message queues,
time of last
\f4shmat\fP
and last
\f4shmdt\fP
on shared memory,
time of last
\f4semop\fP
on semaphores.
See below.
.TP
\f4\-a\f1
Use all print
options.
(This is a shorthand notation for
\f4\-b\f1,
\f4\-c\f1,
\f4\-o\f1,
\f4\-p\f1,
and
\f4\-t.\f1)
.TP
\f4\-C\f2 corefile\^\f1
Use the file
.I corefile\^
in place of
\f4/dev/kmem\f1.
.TP
\f4\-N\f2 namelist\^\f1
Use the file
.I namelist\^
in place of \f4/stand/unix\f1.
.PD
.PP
.TP
\f4\-X\f1
Print information about XENIX interprocess communication, in addition
to the standard interprocess communication status.  The XENIX process 
information describes a second set of semaphores and shared memory.
.PP
Note that the \f4\-p\f1 option does not print process number information
for XENIX shared memory, and the \f4\-t\f1 option does not print time
information about XENIX semaphores and shared memory.
.PP
The column headings and the meaning of the columns in an
\f4ipcs\fP
listing
are given below; the letters in parentheses indicate the
options
that cause the corresponding heading to appear;
``all''
means that the heading always appears.
Note that these
options
only determine
what information is provided for each facility; they do
not
determine which facilities are listed.
.ta 10n
.PP
.PD 0
.TP 16
\f4T\f1	(all)
Type of the facility:
.RS 20
.TP 4
\f4q\f1
message queue
.TP
\f4m\f1
shared memory segment
.TP
\f4s\f1
semaphore
.RE
.PD
.TP 16
\f4ID\f1	(all)
The identifier for the facility entry.
.TP
\f4KEY\f1	(all)
The key used as an argument to
\f4msgget\fP,
\f4semget\fP,
or
\f4shmget\fP
to create the facility entry.
(Note:\ 
The key of a shared memory segment is changed to
\f4IPC_PRIVATE\f1
when the segment has been removed until all processes attached to the segment
detach it.)\ 
.TP
\f4MODE\f1	(all)
The facility access modes and flags:
The mode consists of 11 characters that are interpreted as follows.
The first two characters are:
.sp \n(PDu
.RS 20
.PD 0
.TP 4
\f4R\f1
A process is waiting on a
.IR msgrcv .
.TP
\f4S\f1
A process is waiting on a
.IR msgsnd .
.TP
\f4D\f1
The associated shared memory segment has been removed.
It will disappear when the last process attached to the segment
detaches it.
.TP
\f4C\f1
The associated shared memory segment is to be cleared when the
first attach is executed.
.TP
\f4\-\f1
The corresponding special flag is not set.
.RE
.PD
.IP "" 16
The next nine characters are interpreted as three sets of three bits each.
The first set refers to the owner's permissions;
the next to permissions of others in the user-group of the facility entry;
and the last to all others.
Within each set, the first character indicates permission to read,
the second character indicates permission to write
or alter the facility entry,
and the last character is currently unused.

.SH NOTES
If the user specifies either the \f4\-C\fP or \f4\-N\fP flag, the real
and effective \f2UID/GID\f1 is set to the real \f2UID/GID\f1 of the
user invoking \f4ipcs\fP.
.P
Things can change while
\f4ipcs\fP
is running; the information it gives is guaranteed to be accurate
only when it was retrieved.

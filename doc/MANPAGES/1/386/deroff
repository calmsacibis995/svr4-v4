.SH NAME
\f4deroff\f1 \- remove \f4nroff\fP/\f4troff\fP, \f4tbl\fP, and \f4eqn\fP constructs
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4deroff\f1
[
\f4\-m\f1
.I x
] [
\f4\-w\f1
] [
.I files
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4deroff\fP
reads each
of the
.I files\^
in sequence
and removes all
\f4troff\fP(1)
requests, macro calls, backslash constructs,
\f4eqn\fP(1)
constructs
(between
\f4\&.EQ\f1
and
.SM
\f4\&.EN\f1
lines, and between
delimiters),
and
\f4tbl\fP(1)
descriptions,
perhaps replacing them with white
space (blanks and blank lines),
and writes the remainder of the file on the standard output.
.PP
\f3Note:\f1 \f4troff\f1(1), \f4nroff\f1(1), and \f4eqn\f1(1)
are not part of this UNIX system release.
.PP
\f4deroff\fP
follows chains of included files
\f1(\f4.so\f1
and
\f4\&.nx\f1
\f4troff\fP
commands);
if a file has already been included, a
\f4\&.so\f1
naming that file
is ignored and a
\f4\&.nx\f1
naming that file
terminates execution.
If no input file is given,
\f4deroff\fP
reads the standard input.
.PP
The
\f4\-m\f1
option may be followed by an
\f4m\f1,
\f4s\f1,
or
\f4l\f1.
The
\f4\-mm\f1
option causes the macros to be
interpreted so that only
running text
is output
(i.e., no text
from macro lines.)\ 
The
\f4\-ml\f1
option
forces the
\f4\-mm\f1
option and also
causes deletion of lists associated with the
\f4mm\f1
macros.
.PP
If the
\f4\-w\f1
option is given, the output is a word list, one ``word''
per line, with all other characters deleted.
Otherwise, the output follows the original, with the deletions mentioned above.
In text, a ``word'' is any string
that
.I contains\^
at least two letters and
is composed
of letters, digits, ampersands
\f1(\f4&\f1),
and
apostrophes
\f1(\f4\^\(fm\^\f1);
in a macro call,
however,
a ``word'' is a string that
.I begins\^
with at least
two letters and contains a total of at least
three letters.
Delimiters are any characters other than
letters, digits, apostrophes,
and ampersands.
Trailing apostrophes and ampersands are removed from ``words.''

Software Technical Discussion and Reference Manual\f1.
.SH NOTES
\f4deroff\fP
is not a complete
\f4troff\fP
interpreter,
so it can be confused by subtle constructs.
Most such errors result in too much rather than too little output.
.PP
The
\f4\-ml\f1
option does not handle nested lists correctly.

.SH NAME
compress, uncompress, zcat \- compress data for storage, uncompress and display compressed files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\f4compress\fP [\f4-dfFqcv\fP] [\f4-b\fP \f2bits\fP] \f2file\fP
.sp .5
\f4uncompress\fP [\f4-fqc\fP] \f2file\fP

.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4compress\fP takes a file and compresses it to the
smallest possible size, creates a compressed output file, and
removes the original file unless the \f4-c\fP option is present.
Compression is achieved by encoding
common strings within the file.
\f4uncompress\fP restores
a previously compressed file to its uncompressed state and
removes the compressed version.
\f4zcat\fP uncompresses and displays
a file on the standard output.
.P
If no file is specified on the command line,
input is taken from the standard input and the output
is directed to the standard output.
Output defaults to a file with the same
filename as the input file with the suffix \f4.Z\fP or it can
be directed through the standard output.
The output files have the same permissions and ownership
as the corresponding input files or the
user's standard permissions if output is
directed through the standard output.
.P
If no space is saved by compression,
the output file is not written unless the \f4-F\fP flag
is present on the command line.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are available from the command line:
.TP 9
\f4-d\fP
Decompresses a compressed file.
.TP
\f4-c\fP
Writes output on the standard output and does not remove original file.
.TP
\f4-b\fP \f2bits\fP
Specifies the maximum number of bits to use in encoding.
.TP
\f4-f\fP
Overwrites previous output file.
.TP
\f4-F\fP
Writes output file even if compression saves no space.
.TP
\f4-q\fP
Generates no output except error messages, if any.
.TP
\f4-v\fP
Prints the name of the file being compressed,
the percentage of compression achieved.
With
\f4uncompress\fP,
the name of of the uncompressed file is printed.

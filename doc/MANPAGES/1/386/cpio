.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4\-i\f1, \f4\-o\f1, and \f4\-p\f1 options
select the action to be performed.
The following list describes each of the actions
(which are mutually exclusive).
.PP
\f4cpio \-i\f1
(copy in) extracts files from the standard input,
which is assumed to be the product of a previous
\f4cpio \-o\f1.
Only files with names that match
.I patterns\^
are selected.
.I patterns\^
are regular expressions given in the filename-generating notation of
\f4sh\fP(1).
In
.IR patterns ,
meta-characters
\f4?\f1,
\f4\(**\f1,
and
\f4[\f1 . . . \f4]\f1
match the slash (\f4/\fP)
character, and backslash (\f4\e\fP)
is an escape character.
A \f4!\f1 meta-character means \f2not\f1.
(For example, the \f4!abc*\f1 pattern would exclude all files that
begin with \f4abc\f1.)
Multiple
.I patterns\^
may be specified and if no
.I patterns\^
are specified, the default for
.I patterns\^
is
\f4\(**\f1
(that is, select all files).
Each pattern must be enclosed in double quotes;
otherwise, the name of a file in the current directory might be used.
Extracted files are conditionally created and copied 
into the current directory tree based on the options described below.
The permissions of the files will be those of the previous \f4cpio \-o\f1.
Owner and group permissions will be the same as the current user
unless the current user is super-user.
If this is true, owner
and group permissions will be the same as those resulting
from the previous \f4cpio \-o\f1.
.PP
NOTE: If \f4cpio \-i\f1 tries to create
a file that already exists
and the existing file
is the same age or younger (newer),
\f4cpio\f1 will output a warning message
and not replace the file.
(The \f4\-u\f1 option can be used to overwrite, unconditionally,
the existing file.)
If file names are given as absolute pathnames to
\f4cpio -o\fP,
then when the files are restored via
\f4cpio -i\fP, they will be written to their original directories regardless
of the current directory.
This behavior can be circumvented by using the
\f4-r\fP
option.
.P
\f4cpio \-o\f1 (copy out)
reads the standard input to obtain a list of path names
and copies those files onto the standard output
together with path name and status information.
.P
\f4cpio \-p\f1 (pass)
reads the standard input to obtain a list of path names
of files that are conditionally created and copied into the destination
\f2directory\fP
tree based on the options described below.
.PP
The meanings of the available options are
.PP
.TP
\f4\-a\f1
Reset access times of input files after they have been copied.
Access times are not reset for linked files when
\f4cpio \-pla\f1
is specified (mutually exclusive with \f4\-m\f1).
.TP
\f4\-A\f1
Append files to an archive.
The \f4\-A\f1 option requires 
the \f4\-O\f1 option.
Valid only with archives that are files,
or that are on floppy diskettes or hard disk partitions.
.TP
\f4\-b\f1
Reverse the order of the bytes within each word.
(Use only with the \f4\-i\f1 option.)
.TP
\f4\-B\f1
Input/output is to be blocked 5,120 bytes to the record.
The default buffer size is device dependent when this
and the \f4\-C\f1 options are not used.
.TP
\f4\-c\f1
Read or write header information in
\s-1ASCII\s+1
character
form for portability.
Always use this option 
(or the \f4\-H \f1 option)
when the origin and the destination machines are different types
(mutually exclusive with \f4\-H\f1 and \f4\-6\f1).
(The \f4\-c\f1 option implies expanded device numbers.)
.TP
\f4\-C\f2 bufsize\f1
Input/output is to be blocked \f2bufsize\f1 bytes to the record,
where \f2bufsize\f1 is replaced by a positive integer.
The default buffer size is device dependent
when this and \f4\-B\f1 options are not used.
.TP
\f4\-d\f1
Directories
are to be created as needed.
.TP
\f4\-E \f2file\f1
Specify an input file (\f2file\f1)
that contains a list of filenames
to be extracted from the archive (one filename per line).
.TP
\f4\-f\f1
Copy in all files
except those in
.I patterns.\^
(See the paragraph on \f4cpio \-i\f1 for a description of \f2patterns\f1.)
.TP
\f4\-H\f2 hdr\f1
Read or write header information in \f2hdr\f1 format.
Always use this option or the \f4\-c\f1 option 
when the origin and the destination machines
are different types
(mutually exclusive with \f4\-c\f1 and \f4\-6\f1).
Valid values for \f2hdr\f1 are:
.RS
.TP 16
\f4crc\f1 or \f4CRC\f1
\s-1ASCII\s+1 header with expanded device numbers and
an additional per-file checksum
.TP 16
\f4ustar\f1 or \f4USTAR\f1
IEEE/P1003 Data Interchange Standard header and format
.TP 16
\f4tar\f1 or \f4TAR\f1
\f4tar\f1 header and format
.TP 16
\f4odc\f1
\s-1ASCII\s+1 header with small device numbers
.RE
.TP
\f4\-I \f2file\f1
Read the contents of \f2file\f1 as an input archive.
If \f2file\f1 is a character special device, and the current
medium has been completely read, replace the medium and press
\s-1RETURN\s+1 to continue to the next medium.
This option is used only with the \f4\-i\f1 option.
.TP
\f4\-k\f1
Attempt to skip corrupted file headers and I/O errors that may be encountered.
If you want to copy files from a medium that is corrupted or out of
sequence, this option lets you read only those files with good headers.
(For \f4cpio\fP archives that contain other \f4cpio\f1 archives, if an
error is encountered \f4cpio\fP may terminate prematurely.
\f4cpio\fP will find the next good header, which may be one for
a smaller archive, and terminate when the smaller archive's trailer is encountered.)
Used only with the \f4\-i\f1 option.
.TP
\f4\-l\f1
Whenever possible,
link files rather than copying them.
(Usable only with the \f4\-p\f1 option.)
.TP
\f4\-L\f1
Follow symbolic links.
The default is not to follow symbolic links.
.TP
\f4\-m\f1
Retain previous file modification time.
This option is ineffective on directories that are being copied
(mutually exclusive with \f4\-a\f1).
.TP
\f4\-M \f2message\f1\f1
Define a \f2message\fP to use when switching media.
When you use the \f4\-O\f1 or \f4\-I\f1 options and specify
a character special device, you can use this option to define
the message that is printed when you reach the end of the medium.
One \f4%d\f1 can be placed in \f2message\fP to print the sequence
number of the next medium needed to continue.
.TP
\f4\-O \f2file\f1\f1
Direct the output of
\f4cpio\fP
to \f2file\f1.
If \f2file\f1 is a character special device and the current medium
is full, replace the medium and press \s-1RETURN\s+1 to
continue to the next medium.
Use only with the \f4\-o\f1 option.
.TP
\f4\-r\f1
Interactively rename files.
If the user presses the \s-1RETURN\s+1 key alone, the file is skipped.
If the user types a ``.'' the original pathname will be retained.
(Not available with \f4cpio \-p\f1.)
.TP
\f4\-R\f2 \s-1ID\s+1\f1
Reassign ownership and group information for each file 
to user \f2\s-1ID\s+1\f1 
(\f2\s-1ID\s+1\f1 must be a valid user \s-1ID\s+1
from \f4/etc/passwd\f1).
This option is valid only for the super-user.
.TP
\f4\-s\f1
Swap bytes within each half word.
.TP
\f4\-S\f1
Swap halfwords within each word.
.TP
\f4\-t\f1
Print a table of contents of the input.
No files are created
(mutually exclusive with
\f4\-V\f1).
.TP
\f4\-u\f1
Copy
unconditionally
(normally, an older file will not replace a newer file with the same name).
.TP
\f4\-v\f1
Verbose: causes a list of file names to be printed.
When used with the
\f4\-t\f1
option, the table of contents looks like the output of an
\f4ls \-l\f1
command [see \f4ls\f1(1)].
.TP
\f4\-V\f1
Special Verbose:
print a dot for each file read or written.
Useful to assure the user that \f4cpio\f1 is working without
printing out all file names.
.TP
\f4\-K\f1
1K Blocks:
force the blocking size to be a multiple of 1K.
.TP
\f4\-T\f1
Truncate:
truncate long file names to 14 characters.
.TP
\f4\-6\f1
Process a \s-1UNIX\s+1 System Sixth Edition archive format file.
Use only with the \f4\-i\f1 option
(mutually exclusive with \f4\-c\f1 and \f4\-H\f1)).
.P
NOTE: 
\f4cpio\fP assumes four-byte words.
.br
.ne5
.PP
If, when writing to a character device
\f1(\f4\-o\f1)
or reading from a character device
\f1(\f4\-i\f1),
\f4cpio\fP reaches the end of a medium 
(such as the end of a diskette),
and the \f4\-O\f1 and \f4\-I\f1 options aren't used,
\f4cpio\fP will print the following message:
.PP
.RS
.ft 4
If you want to go on, type device/file name when ready.
.ft 1
.RE
.PP
To continue, you must replace the medium and type the character
special device name
(\f4/dev/rdsk/f0\f1
for example) and
press \s-1RETURN\s+1.
You may want to continue by directing \f4cpio\fP to
use a different device.
For example, if you have two floppy drives 
you may want to switch between them 
so \f4cpio\fP can proceed while you are changing the floppies.
(Simply pressing \s-1RETURN\s+1
causes the \f4cpio\fP process to exit.)
.SH EXAMPLES
The following examples show three uses of \f4cpio\fP.
.PP
When standard input is directed through a pipe to  
\f4cpio \-o\f1,
it groups the files so they can be directed (>) to a single file
(\f4../newfile\f1).
The \f4\-c\f1 option insures that 
the file will be portable to other machines
(as would the \f4\-H\f1 option).
Instead of \f4ls\fP(1),
you could use
\f4find\fP(1),
\f4echo\fP(1),
\f4cat\fP(1),
and so on, to pipe a list of names to \f4cpio\fP.
You could direct the output to a device instead of a file.
.PP
.RS
\f4ls \|\(bv \|cpio \|\-oc \|> ../newfile\f1
.RE
.PP
\f4cpio \-i\f1
uses the output file of 
\f4cpio \-o\f1
(directed through a pipe with \f4cat\f1 in the example below), extracts those 
files that match
the patterns
\f1(\f4memo/a1\f1,
\f4memo/b\(**\f1),
creates directories below the current directory as needed
\f1(\f4\-d\f1
option), and places the files in the appropriate directories.
The \f4\-c\f1 option is used if the input file was created with
a portable header.
If no patterns were given, all files from
\f4newfile\f1
would be placed in the directory.
.PP
.RS
\f4cat newfile \|\(bv \|cpio \|\-icd "memo/a1" "memo/b\(**"\f1
.RE
.PP
\f4cpio \-p\f1 takes the file names piped to it and copies 
or links (\f4\-l\f1 option)
those files to another directory (\f4newdir\f1 in the example below).
The
\f4\-d\f1
option
says to create directories as needed.
The
\f4\-m\f1
option says retain the
modification time.
(It is important to use the
\f4\-depth \f1
option of
\f4find\fP(1)
to generate path names for
\f4cpio\fP.
This eliminates problems 
\f4cpio\fP could have trying to create files under read-only directories.)
The destination directory, \f4newdir\f1, must exist.
.PP
.RS
\f4find . \-depth \-print \|\(bv \|cpio \|\-pdlmv \|newdir\f1
.RE
.PP
Note that when you use \f4cpio\fP in conjunction with \f4find\fP,
if you use the \f4\-L\f1 option with \f4cpio\fP
then you must use the \f4\-follow\f1 option with \f4find\fP
and vice versa.
Otherwise there will be undesirable results.

\f4archives\fP(4)
in the \f2System Administrator's Reference Manual\f1
.SH NOTES
An archive created with the \f4\-c\f1 option on a System V Release 4
system cannot be read on System V Release 3.2 systems, or earlier.
Use the \f4\-H odc\f1 option,
which is equivalent to the header created by the \f4\-c\f1 option
in earlier System V releases, if the \f4cpio\f1 image will be read
on a pre-System V Release 4 system.
.PP
System V Releases prior to Release 4 do not recognize symbolic links.
The result of copying in a symbolic link on an older release
will be a regular file that contains the pathname of the
referenced file.
.PP
Path names are restricted to 256 characters for the binary (the default)
and\p
.br
\f4\-H odc\f1
header formats.
Otherwise, path names are restricted to 1024 characters.
.PP
Only the super-user can copy special files.
.PP
Blocks are reported in 512-byte quantities.
.PP
If a file has \f4000\fP permissions, 
contains more than 0 characters of data,
and the user is not root, 
the file will not be saved or restored.
.P
When attempting to redirect \f4stdin\fP or \f4stdout\fP from or to a
character or block special device (for example, \f4/dev/diskette\fP),
an error message ``\f4Cannot read from device\fP''
or ``\f4Cannot write to device\fP,''
does not necessarily indicate that a true I/O error has occurred.
More likely, the user does not have access to that device,
and should request that the system administrator allocate
that device for the user [see \f4admalloc\fP(1M)].
.P
Prior to Release 4, the default buffer size was 512 bytes.
Beginning with Release 4,
the default buffer size is optimized for the device and
using the \f4-C\fP option to specify a different block size may cause
\f4cpio\fP to fail.
Therefore, care must be taken when choosing the block size.
For example, for floppy disks,
\f2bufsize\f1 must be a multiple of 512 (one floppy sector).
To avoid wasting space on streaming tape drives, use the
\f4-C\fP option with an appropriate block size.

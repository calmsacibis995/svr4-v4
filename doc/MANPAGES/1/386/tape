.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4tape\fP
[ \f4-csf8i\fP ]
[ \f4-a\fP \f2arg\fP ]
\f2command\fP [ \f2device\fP ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4tape\fP
sends commands to and receives status from the tape subsystem.
\f4tape\fP
can communicate with
QIC-24/QIC-02 cartridge tape drives and SCSI tape drives.
.P
\f4tape\fP
reads
\f4/etc/default/tape\fP
to find the default device name for sending commands and receiving status.
For example, the following line in
\f4/etc/default/tape\fP
will cause
\f4tape\fP
to communicate with the QIC-24/QIC-02 cartridge tape device:
.IP
\f4device = /dev/rmt/c0s0\fP
.P
If a device name is specified on the command line,
it overrides the default device.
\f4tape\fP queries the device to determine its device type.
If the device does not respond to the query,
for example if the cartridge tape driver is from
an earlier release,
\f4tape\fP
will print a warning message and assume the
device is a QIC-24/QIC-02 cartridge tape.
.SH OPTIONS
You can explicitly specify the type of the device
by using the device type flags, as follows:
.sp
.RS
.nf
\f4-c\fP	QIC-24/QIC-02 cartridge tape
\f4-s\fP	SCSI tape
.fi
.RE
.SH COMMANDS
The following commands can be used with the
various tape drivers supported under UNIX.
The letters following each description
indicate which drivers support each
command:
.sp
.RS
.nf
A	All drivers
C	QIC-24/QIC-02 cartridge tape driver
S	SCSI tape driver
.RE
.fi
.sp
.TP 12
\f4erase\fP
Erase and retension the tape cartridge.
(C,S)
.TP 12
\f4reset\fP
Reset tape controller and tape drive. Clears error conditions and
returns tape subsystem to power-up state.
(C,S)
.TP 12
\f4reten\fP
Retension tape cartridge.
Should be used periodically to remedy slack tape problems.
Tape slack can cause an unusually large number of tape errors.
(A)
.TP 12
\f4rewind\fP
Rewind to beginning of tape.
(A)
.TP 12
\f4rfm\fP
Wind tape forward to the next file mark.
(C,S)

.SH NOTES
The \f4reset\fP
command can be used while the tape is busy with other operations.
All other commands wait until the currently executing
command has been completed before proceeding.
.P
When you are using the non-rewinding tape device or the \f4tape\fP command
\f4rfm\fP, the tape drive light remains on after the
command has been completed, indicating that more operations may be
performed on the tape.
The \f4tape rewind\fP command may be used to clear this condition.

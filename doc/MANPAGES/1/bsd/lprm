.SH NAME
\f4lprm\f1 \- remove jobs from the printer queue

.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4lprm\f1
removes a job or jobs from a printer's spooling queue.
Since the spool directory is protected from users, using
\f4lprm\f1
is normally the only method by which a user can remove a job.
.P
Without any arguments,
\f4lprm\f1
deletes the job that is currently active, provided that the user who
invoked
\f4lprm\f1
owns that job.
.P
When the privileged user specifies a
.IR username ,
\f4lprm\f1
removes all jobs belonging to that user.
.P
You can remove a specific job by supplying its job number as an
argument, which you can obtain using
\f4lpq\f1(1).
For example:
.P
.nf
.RS
.ta\w'active'u+2n +\w'wendy'u+2n +\w'385'u+2n +\w'standard input'u+16n
\f4lpq  \-Phost\f1

.RE
.P
\f4lprm\f1
reports the names of any files it removes, and is
silent if there are no applicable jobs to remove.
.P
\f4lprm\f1
Sends the request to cancel a job to the print spooler,
\f4LPSCHED\f1.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 10
\f4\-P\f2printer\f1
Specify the queue associated with a specific
printer.
Otherwise the value of the
\f4PRINTER\fP
variable in the environment is used.
If this variable is unset,
the queue for the default printer is used.
.TP
\f4\-\f1
Remove all jobs owned by you.
If invoked by the privileged user, all
jobs in the spool are removed.
Job ownership is determined by the
user's login name and host name on the machine where the
\f4lpr\f1
command was executed.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP
\f4lprm: \f2printer\fP\|: unknown printer\f1
The
\f4printer\f1
was not found in the
System V
.SM LP
database.
Usually this is a typing mistake; however, it 
may indicate that the printer does not exist on the system.
Use
\f1`\f4lptstat \-p\f1'
to find the reason.
.TP
\f4lprm: error on opening queue to spooler\f1
The connection to
\f4lpsched\f1
on the local machine failed.
This usually means the printer server started at
boot time has died or is hung.
Check if the printer
spooler daemon 
\f4/usr/lib/lpsched\f1
is running.
.TP
\f4lprm: Can't send message to the LP print service\f1
.TP
\f4lprm: Can't receive message from the LP print service\f1
These indicate that the
.SM LP
print service has been 
stopped.
Get help from the system administrator. 
.TP
\f4lprm: Received unexpected message from the LP print service\f1
It is likely there is an error in this software.
Get help from system administrator.
.TP 
\f4lprm: Can't cancel request\f1
You are not allowed to remove another's request.
.SH NOTES
.P
An active job may be incorrectly identified for removal by an
\f4lprm\f1
command issued with no arguments.
During the interval between an
\f4lpq\f1(1)
command and the execution of
\f4lprm\f1,
the next job in queue may have become active; that job
may be removed unintentionally if it is owned by you.
To avoid this, supply
\f4lprm\f1
with the job number to remove when a critical job that
you own is next in line.
.P
Only the privileged user can remove print jobs submitted from another host.
.P
\f4lp\f1 is the preferred interface.

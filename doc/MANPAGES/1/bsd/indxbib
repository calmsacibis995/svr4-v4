.SH NAME
\f4indxbib\f1 \- create an inverted index to a bibliographic database
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/usr/ucb/indxbib\f1
\f2database-file\f1 .\ .\ .
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4indxbib\f1
makes an inverted index to the named
.I database-file
(which must reside within the current directory),
typically for use by
\f4lookbib\f1
and
\f4refer\f1.
A
.I database
contains bibliographic references
(or other kinds of information) separated by blank lines.
.P
A bibliographic reference is a set of lines,
constituting fields of bibliographic information. 
Each field starts on a line beginning with a
\f1`\f4%\f1',
followed by a key-letter, then a blank, and finally the
contents of the field, which may continue
until the next line starting with
\f1`\f4%\f1'
(see \f4addbib\f1).
.P
\f4indxbib\f1
is a shell script that calls two programs:
\f4mkey\f1
and
\f4inv\f1.
\f4mkey\f1
truncates words to 6 characters,
and maps upper case to lower case.
It also discards words shorter than 3 characters,
words among the 100 most
common English words, and numbers (dates) < 1900 or > 2000. 
These parameters can be changed.
.P
\f4indxbib\f1
creates an entry file (with a \f4.ia\f1
suffix), a posting file
(\f4.ib\f1),
and a tag file
(\f4.ic\f1),
in the working directory.

.SH NOTES
All dates should probably be indexed,
since many disciplines refer to literature
written in the 1800s or earlier.
.P
\f4indxbib\f1
does not recognize pathnames.

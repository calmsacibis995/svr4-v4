.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/usr/ucb/vacation\f1 [ \f4\-I\f1 ]
.br
\f4/usr/ucb/vacation\f1 [ \f4\-j\f1 ] [ \f4\-a\f2alias\f1 ] [ \f4\-t\f2N\f1 ] \f2username\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4vacation\f1
automatically replies to incoming mail.
The reply is contained in the file
\f4\&.vacation.msg\f1,
that you create in your home directory.
.P
This file should include a header with at least a
`\f4Subject:\f1'
line (it should not include a
`\f4From:\f1'
or a
`\f4To:\f1'
line).
For example:
.RS
.sp .5
.nf
.ft 4
Subject: I am on vacation
I am on vacation until July 22.  If you have something urgent,
please contact Joe Jones (jones@f40).
	--John
.ft 1
.fi
.RE
.P
If the string
\f4$SUBJECT\f1
appears in the
\f4\&.vacation.msg\f1
file,
it is replaced with the subject of the original message when the
reply is sent; thus, a
\f4\&.vacation.msg\f1
file such as
.RS
.sp .5
.nf
.ft 4
Subject: I am on vacation
I am on vacation until July 22.
Your mail regarding "$\s-1SUBJECT\s0" will be read when I return.
If you have something urgent, please contact
Joe Jones (jones@f40).
	--John
.ft 1
.fi
.RE
.P
will include the subject of the message in the reply.
.P
No message is sent if the
`\f4To:\f1'
or the
`\f4Cc:\f1'
line does not list the user to whom the original message was sent or
one of a number of aliases for them,
if the initial
\f4From\f1
line includes the string
\f4\-\s-1REQUEST\s0@\f1,
or if a
`\f4Precedence: bulk\f1'
or
`\f4Precedence: junk\f1'
line is included in the header.
.P
The following options are available:
.TP .5i
\f4\-I\f1
Initialize the
\f4\&.vacation.pag\f1
and
\f4\&.vacation.dir\f1
files and start
\f4/usr/ucb/vacation\f1.
.P
If the
\f4\-I\f1
flag is not specified, and a
\f2user\f1
argument is given,
\f4/usr/ucb/vacation\f1
reads the first line from the standard input
(for a
`\f4From:\f1'
line, no colon).
If absent, it produces an error message.
The following options may be
specified:
.TP .5i
\f4\-a\f2alias\f1
Indicate that
\f2alias\f1
is one of the valid aliases for the user running
\f4/usr/ucb/vacation\f1,
so that mail addressed to that alias generates a reply.
.TP
\f4\-j\f1
Do not check whether the recipient appears in the
`\f4To: '
or the
`\f4Cc:\f1'
line.
.TP
\f4\-t\f2N\f1
Change the interval between repeat replies to the same sender.
The default is 1 week.
A trailing
\f4s\f1,
\f4m\f1,
\f4h\f1,
\f4d\f1,
or
\f4w\f1
scales
\f2N\f1
to seconds, minutes, hours, days, or weeks respectively.
.SH USAGE
To start
\f4/usr/ucb/vacation\f1,
create a
\f4\&.forward\f1
file in your home directory containing a line of the form:
.IP
\f4\e\f2username\f4, "|/usr/ucb/vacation \f2username\f4"\f1
.P
where
\f2username\f1
is your login name.
.P
Then type in the command:
.IP
\f4/usr/ucb/vacation \-I\f1
.P
To stop
\f4/usr/ucb/vacation\f1,
remove the
\f4\&.forward\f1
file, or move it to a new name.
.P
If
\f4/usr/ucb/vacation\f1
is run with no arguments, it will permit you to interactively turn
\f4/usr/ucb/vacation\f1
on or off.
It will create a
\f4\&.vacation.msg\f1
file for you, or edit an existing one,
using the editor specified by the
\f4VISUAL\f1
or
\f4EDITOR\f1
environment variable, or
\f4vi\f1(1)
if neither of those environment variables are set.
If a
\f4\&.forward\f1
file is present in your home directory, it will ask whether you want
to remove it and turn off
\f4/usr/ucb/vacation\f1.
If it is not present in your home directory, it creates
it for you, and automatically performs a
`\f4/usr/ucb/vacation \-I\f1'
function, turning on
\f4/usr/ucb/vacation\f1.

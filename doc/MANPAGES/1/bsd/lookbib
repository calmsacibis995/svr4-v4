.SH NAME
\f4lookbib\f1 \- find references in a bibliographic database
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/usr/ucb/lookbib\f1
.I database
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
A bibliographic reference is a set of lines,
constituting fields of bibliographic information. 
Each field starts on a line beginning with a
\f1`\f4%\f1',
followed by a key-letter, then a blank, and finally the
contents of the field, which may continue
until the next line starting with
\f1`\f4%\f1'.
See
\f4addbib\f1.
.P
\f4lookbib\f1
uses an inverted index made by
\f4indxbib\f1
to find sets of bibliographic references. 
It reads keywords typed after the
\f1`\f4>\f1'
prompt on the terminal, and retrieves records
containing all these keywords.
If nothing matches, nothing is returned
except another
\f1`\f4>\f1'
prompt.
.P
It is possible to search multiple databases, as long as they have a
common index made by
\f4indxbib\f1.
In that case, only the first argument given to
\f4indxbib\f1
is specified to
\f4lookbib\f1.
.P
If
\f4lookbib\f1
does not find the index files (the
\f4\&.i[abc]\f1
files), it looks for a
reference file with the same name as the argument,
without the suffixes.
It creates a file with a
\f4\&.ig\f1
suffix, suitable for use with
\f4fgrep \f1
(see \f4grep\f1).
\f4lookbib\f1
then uses this
\f4fgrep\f1
file to find references. 
This method is simpler to use, but the
\f4\&.ig\f1
file is slower to use than the
\f4\&.i[abc]\f1
files, and does not allow the use of multiple reference files.

.SH NOTES
Probably all dates should be indexed,
since many disciplines refer to literature
written in the 1800s or earlier.

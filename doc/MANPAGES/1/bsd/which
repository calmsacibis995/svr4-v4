.SH NAME
\f4which\f1 \- locate a command; display its pathname or alias
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/usr/ucb/which\f1 [ \f2filename\f1 ] .\ .\ .
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4which\f1
takes a list of names and looks for the files which would be
executed had these names been given as commands.
Each argument is expanded if it is aliased,
and searched for along the user's path.
Both aliases and path are taken from the user's
\f4\&.cshrc\f1
file.
.SH FILES
.PD 0
.TP 20
\f4~/\&.cshrc\f1
source of aliases and path values
.PD
.SH SEE ALSO
\f4csh\fP(1),
\f4ksh\fP(1),
\f4sh\fP(1)
in the \f2User's Reference Manual\f1.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
A diagnostic is given for names which
are aliased to more than a single word,
or if an executable file with the
argument name was not found in the path.
.SH NOTES
Only aliases and paths from
\f4~/\&.cshrc\f1
are used; importing from the current
environment is not attempted.
.P
\f4which\f1
must be executed by
\f4csh\f1(1),
since only
\f4csh\f1
knows about aliases.
If you are using \f4sh\f1 instead of \f4csh\f1,
\f4whence \-v\f1 provides similar functionality.
.P
To compensate for
\f4\&~/.cshrc\f1
files in which aliases depend upon the
\f4prompt\f1
variable being set,
\f4which\f1
sets this variable.
If the
\f4\&~/.cshrc\f1
produces output or prompts for input when
\f4prompt\f1
is set,
\f4which\f1
may produce some strange results.

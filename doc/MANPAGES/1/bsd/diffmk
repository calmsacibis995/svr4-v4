.SH NAME
\f4diffmk\f1 \- mark differences between versions of a \f4troff\f1 input file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/usr/ucb/diffmk\f1
.I oldfile newfile markedfile
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
The
\f4diffmk\f1
command compares two versions of a file and creates a
third version that includes ``change mark''
\f1(\f4.mc\f1)
commands for
\f4nroff\f1
and 
\f4troff\f1.
.I oldfile
and
.I newfile
are the old and new versions of the file.
\f4diffmk\f1
generates
.IR markedfile ,
which, contains the text from
.I newfile
with 
\f4troff\f1(1)
``change mark'' requests
\f1(\f4.\|mc\f1)
inserted where 
.I newfile
differs from 
.IR oldfile .
When
.I markedfile
is formatted,
changed or inserted text is shown by a
\f4|\f1
at the right margin of each line.
The position of deleted text is shown by a single
\f4*\f1.
.P
\f4diffmk\f1
can also be used in conjunction with the proper 
\f4troff\f1
requests to produce program listings with marked changes.
In the following command line:
.IP
.ft 4
diffmk old.c new.c marked.c ; nroff reqs marked.c | pr
.ft 1
.P 
the file
\f4reqs\f1
contains the following
\f4troff\f1
requests:
.RS
.ft 4
.nf
\&.\|pl \|1
\&.\|ll \|77
\&.\|nf
\&.\|eo
\&.\|nh
.ft 1
.fi
.RE
.P
which eliminate page breaks, adjust the line length, set no-fill
mode, ignore escape characters, and turn off hyphenation,
respectively.
.P
If the characters 
\f4|\f1
and
\f4*\f1
are inappropriate, you might run 
.I markedfile 
through 
\f4sed\f1
to globally change them.

.SH NOTES
Aesthetic considerations may dictate
manual adjustment of some output.
File differences involving only formatting
requests may produce undesirable
output, that is, replacing
\f4\&.\|sp\f1
by
\f4\&.\|sp 2\f1
will produce a ``change mark'' on the preceding
or following line of output.

.SH NAME
\f4unifdef\f1 \- resolve and remove \f4ifdef\f1'ed lines from \f4C\f1 program source
.SH SYNOPSIS
.na
\f4/usr/ucb/unifdef\f1 [ \f4\-clt\f1 ] [ \f4\-D\f2name\f1 ] [ \f4\-U\f2name\f1 ] [ \f4\-iD\f2name\f1 ]
[ \f4\-iU\f2name\f1 ] \&.\ .\ .\ [\ \f2filename\f1\ ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4unifdef\f1
removes
\f4ifdef\f1ed
lines from a file while otherwise leaving the file alone.
It is smart enough to deal with the nested
\f4ifdef\f1s,
comments, single and double quotes of C
syntax, but it does not do any including or interpretation of macros.
Neither does it strip out comments,
though it recognizes and ignores them.
You specify which symbols you want defined with
\f4\-D\f1
options, and which you want undefined with
\f4\-U\f1
options.
Lines within those
\f4ifdef\f1s
will be
copied to the output, or removed, as appropriate.
Any
\f4ifdef\f1,
\f4ifndef\f1,
\f4else\f1,
and
\f4endif\f1
lines associated with
.I filename
will also be removed.
.P
\f4ifdef\f1s
involving symbols you do not specify are untouched and copied out
along with their associated
\f4ifdef\f1,
\f4else\f1,
and
\f4endif\f1
lines.
.P
If an
\f4ifdef\f2X\f1
occurs nested inside another
\f4ifdef\f2X\f1,\f1
then the inside
\f4ifdef\f1
is treated as if it were an unrecognized symbol.
If the same symbol appears in more than one argument, only the first
occurrence is significant.
.P
\f4unifdef\f1
copies its output to the standard output
and will take its input from the standard input
if no
.I filename
argument is given.
.P
The following options are available:
.TP 10
\f4\-c\f1
Complement the normal operation.
Lines that would have been removed or blanked
are retained, and vice versa.
.TP
\f4\-l\f1
Replace ``lines removed'' lines with blank lines.
.TP
\f4\-t\f1
Plain text option.
\f4unifdef\f1
refrains from attempting to recognize
comments and single and double quotes.
.TP
\f4\-iD\f2name\f1
Ignore, but print out, lines associated with the defined symbol
.IR name .
If you use
\f4ifdef\f1s
to delimit non-C
lines, such as comments or code which is
under construction, then you must tell
\f4unifdef\f1
which symbols are used for that purpose so that it will
not try to parse
for quotes and comments within them.
.TP
\f4\-iU\f2name\f1
Ignore, but print out, lines associated with the undefined symbol
.IR name .

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP 20
\f4Premature EOF\f1
Inappropriate
\f4else\f1
or
\f4endif\f1.
.P
Exit status is 0 if output is exact copy of input,
1 if not, 2 if 
\f4unifdef\f1
encounters problems.

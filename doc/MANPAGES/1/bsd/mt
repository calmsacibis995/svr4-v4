.SH NAME
\f4mt\f1 \- magnetic tape control
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/usr/ucb/mt\f1
[
\f4\-f\f1
.I tapename
]
.I command
[
.I count
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4mt\f1
sends commands to a magnetic tape drive.
If
.I tapename
is not specified, the environment variable
\f4TAPE\f1
is used.
If
\f4TAPE\f1
does not exist,
\f4mt\f1
uses the device
\f4/dev/rmt12\f1.
.I tapename
must refer to a raw (not block) tape device.
By default,
\f4mt\f1
performs the requested operation once;  multiple operations
may be performed by specifying
.IR count .
.P
The available commands are listed below.
Only as many
characters as are required to uniquely identify a command
need be specified.
.P
\f4mt\f1
returns a 0 exit status when the operation(s)
were successful, 1 if the command was
unrecognized or if
\f4mt\f1
was unable to open the specified tape drive,
and 2 if an operation failed.
.P
the following commands are available to
\f4mt\f1:
.TP 13
\f4eof\f1,\f4 weof\f1
Write
.I count
.SM EOF
marks at the current position on the tape.
.TP
\f4fsf\f1
Forward space
.I count
files.
.TP
\f4fsr\f1
Forward space
.I count
records.
.TP
\f4bsf\f1
Back space
.I count
files.
.TP
\f4bsr\f1
Back space
.I count
records.
.TP
\f4asf\f1
Absolute space to 
.I count
file number.
This is equivalent to a
\f4rewind\f1
followed by a
\f4fsf\f1
.I count.
.P
For the following commands,
.I count
is ignored:
.TP 13
\f4eom\f1
Space to the end of recorded media on the tape
(\s-1SCSI\s0 only).
This is useful for appending files onto previously written tapes.
.TP
\f4rewind\f1
Rewind the tape.
.TP
\f4offline\f1,\f4 rewoffl\f1
Rewind, unload, and place the tape drive unit off-line.
.TP
\f4status\f1
Print status information about the tape unit.
.TP
\f4retension\f1
Wind the tape to the end of the reel
and then rewind it, smoothing out
the tape tension.
.TP
\f4erase\f1
Erase the entire tape.

.SH NOTES
Not all devices support all options.
For example,
\f4ar\f1
currently does not support the
\f4fsr\f1,
\f4bsf\f1,
or
\f4bsr\f1
options.
The half-inch tape driver,
\f4/dev/rmt*,\f1
does not support the
\f4retension\f1
option.

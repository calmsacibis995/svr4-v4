.SH NAME
\f4prt\f1 \- display the delta and commentary history of an SCCS file

.SH DESCRIPTION
Note: the
\f4prt\f1
command is an older version of
\f4prs\f1(1)
that in most circumstances is more convenient to use,
but is less flexible than
\f4prs\f1.
.P
\f4prt\f1
prints part or all of an
.SM SCCS
file in a useful format.
If a directory is named,
\f4prt\f1
behaves as though each file in the directory were
specified as a named file,
except that non-\s-1SCCS\s0 files
(last component of the pathname does not begin with
\f4s.\f1)
and unreadable files
are silently ignored.
If a name of
\f1`\f4\-\f1'
is given, the standard input is read;
each line of the standard input is taken to be the name of an
.SM SCCS
file to be processed.
Again, non-\s-1SCCS\s0 files and unreadable files are silently ignored.
.P
The following options are available with
\f4prt :\f1
.TP
\f4\-a\f1
Print those types of deltas normally not printed by the
\f4d\f1
keyletter.  These are types
\f4R\f1
(removed).
This keyletter is effective only if the
\f4d\f1
keyletter is also specified (or assumed).
.TP
\f4\-b\f1
Print the body of the
.SM SCCS
file.
.TP
\f4\-d\f1
This keyletter normally prints
delta table entries of the
\f4D\f1
type.
.TP
\f4\-e\f1
This keyletter implies the
\f4d\f1,
\f4i\f1,
\f4u\f1,
\f4f\f1,
and
\f4t\f1
keyletters and is provided for convenience.
.TP
\f4\-f\f1
Print the flags of the named file.
.TP
\f4\-i\f1
Print the serial numbers of those deltas included,
excluded, and ignored.
This keyletter is effective only if the
\f4d\f1
keyletter is also specified (or assumed).
.RS
.P
The following format is used to print those
portions of the
.SM SCCS
file as specified by the above keyletters.
The printing of each delta table entry
is preceded by a
.SM NEWLINE\s0.

.PD

.TP
\f4\-s\f1
Print only the first line of the delta table entries;
that is, only up to the statistics.
This keyletter is effective only if the
\f4d\f1
keyletter is also specified (or assumed).
.TP
\f4\-t\f1
Print the descriptive text
contained in the file.
.TP
\f4\-u\f1
Print the login-names and/or numerical group
.SM ID\s0s
of those users allowed to make deltas.
.TP
\f4\-y\fP[\f2\s-1SID\s0\f1]
Print the delta table entries to stop
when the delta just printed has the specified
\s-1SID\s0.
If no delta in the table has the specified
\s-1SID\s0,
the entire table is printed.  If no
.SM SID
is specified, the first delta in the delta table is printed.
This keyletter will print the entire
delta table entry for each delta 
as a single line (the
.SM NEWLINE
in the normal multi-line format of the
\f4d\f1
keyletter are replaced by
.SM SPACE
characters)
preceded by the name of the
.SM SCCS
file being processed, followed by a
\f4:\f1,
followed by a
.SM TAB\s0.
This keyletter
is effective only if the
\f4d\f1
keyletter is also specified (or assumed).
.TP
\f4\-c\fP[\f2cutoff\^\f1]
Stop printing the delta table entries
if the delta about to be printed is older than the
specified cutoff date-time (see
\f4get\f1(1)
for the format of date-time).
If no date-time is supplied, the
epoch 0000
\s-1GMT\s0
Jan. 1, 1970 is used.
As with the
\f4y\f1
keyletter, this keyletter will cause the entire delta table
entry to be printed as a single line and
to be preceded by the name of the
.SM SCCS
file being processed,
followed by a
\f4:\f1,
followed by a tab.
This keyletter is effective only if the
\f4d\f1
keyletter is also specified (or assumed).
.TP
\f4\-r\fP[\f2rev-cutoff\^\f1]
Begin printing the delta table entries
when the delta about to be printed
is older than or equal to the
specified cutoff date-time (see
\f4get\f1(1)
for the format of date-time).
If no date-time is supplied, the
epoch 0000
\s-1GMT\s0
Jan. 1, 1970 is used.
(In this case, nothing will be printed).
As with the
\f4y\f1
keyletter, this keyletter will cause the entire delta table
entry to be printed as a single line and
to be preceded by the name of the
.SM SCCS
file being processed,
followed by a
\f4:\f1,
followed by a tab.
This keyletter is effective only if the
\f4d\f1
keyletter is also specified (or assumed).
.P
If any keyletter but
\f4y\f1,
\f4c\f1,
or
\f4r\f1
is supplied, the name of the file being
processed (preceded by one
.SM NEWLINE
and followed by two
.SM NEWLINE
characters) is printed before its contents.
.P
If none of the
\f4u\f1,
\f4f\f1,
\f4t\f1,
or
\f4b\f1
keyletters is supplied, the
\f4d\f1
keyletter is assumed.
.P
Note: the
\f4s\f1
and
\f4i\f1
keyletters, and the
\f4c\f1
and
\f4r\f1
keyletters are mutually exclusive;
therefore, they may not be specified together on the same
\f4prt\f1
command.
.P
The form of the delta table
as produced by the
\f4y\f1,
\f4c\f1,
and
\f4r\f1
keyletters makes it easy to sort multiple delta tables in
chronological order.
.P
When both the
\f4y\f1
and
\f4c\f1
or the
\f4y\f1
and
\f4r\f1
keyletters are supplied,
\f4prt\f1
will stop printing when the first of the two conditions is met.

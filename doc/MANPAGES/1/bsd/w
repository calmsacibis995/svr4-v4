.SH NAME
\f4w\f1 \- who is logged in, and what are they doing
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/usr/ucb/w\f1
[
\f4\-hls\f1
] [
.I user
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\f4w\f1
command displays a summary of the current activity on the system,
including what each user is doing.
The heading line shows the current time of day, how long the system has
been up, and the number of users logged into the system.
.P
The fields displayed are: the users login name, the name of the tty
the user is on, the time of day the user logged on (in \f2hours:minutes\fP),
the idle time\(emthat is, the number of minutes since the user last
typed anything (in \f2hours:minutes\fP), the
.SM CPU
time used by all processes and their children on that terminal
(in \f2minutes:seconds\fP), the
.SM CPU
time used by the currently active processes
(in \f2minutes:seconds\fP), the name and arguments of the current process.
.P
If a
.I user
name is included, output is restricted to that user.
.P
The following options are available:
.TP
\f4\-h\f1
Suppress the heading.
.TP
\f4\-l\f1
Produce a long form of output, which is the default.
.TP
\f4\-s\f1
Produce a short form of output.
In the short form, the tty is abbreviated,
the login time and
.SM CPU
times are left off, as are the arguments to commands.

.SH NOTES
The notion of the ``current process'' is muddy.
The current algorithm is
`the highest numbered process on the terminal that is not ignoring
interrupts, or, if there is none, the highest numbered process on the
terminal'.
This fails, for example, in critical sections of programs
like the shell and editor, or when faulty programs running in the
background fork and fail to ignore interrupts.
In cases where no process can be found, \f4w\f1 prints \f5\-\f1.
.P
The
.SM CPU
time is only an estimate, in particular, if someone leaves a
background process running after logging out, the person currently
on that terminal is ``charged'' with the time.
.P
Background processes are not shown, even though they account for
much of the load on the system.
.P
Sometimes processes, typically those in the background, are
printed with null or garbaged arguments.
In these cases, the name of the command is printed in parentheses.
.P
\f4w\f1
does not know about the conventions for detecting background jobs.
It will sometimes find a background job instead of the right one.

.SH NAME
\f4copy\fP \- copy groups of files
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4copy\fP [\f2option\f1]. . .\f2source\f1. . .\f2dest\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4copy\fP command copies the contents of directories to another
directory.
It is possible to copy whole file systems since directories 
are made when needed.
.P
If files, directories, or special files do not exist at the destination,
then they are created with the same modes and flags as the source.
In addition, the super-user may set the user and group \f4ID\fP.
The owner and mode are not changed if the destination file exists.
Note that there may be more than one source directory.
If so, the effect
is the same as if the \f4copy\fP command had been issued for each source 
directory with the same destination directory for each copy.
.P
All of the options must be given as separate arguments, and they may
appear in any order even after the other arguments.
The arguments are:
.TP 10
\f4-a\fP
Asks the user before attempting a copy.
If the response does not begin
with a "y", then a copy is not done.
This option also sets the \f4ad\fP
option.
.TP
\f4-l\fP
Uses links instead whenever they can be used.
Otherwise a copy is done.
Note that links are never done for special files or directories.
.TP
\f4-n\fP
Requires the destination file to be new.
If not, then the \f4copy\fP
command does not change the destination file.
The \f4-n\fP flag is
meaningless for directories.
For special files an \f4-n\fP flag is 
assumed (that is, the destination of a special file must not exist).
.TP
\f4-o\fP
If set then every file copied has its owner and group set to those of
source.
If not set, then the file's owner is the user who invoked
the program.
.TP
\f4-m\fP
If set, then every file copied has its modification time and access time
set to that of the source.
If not set, then the modification time is set
to the time of the copy.
.TP
\f4-r\fP
If set, then every directory is recursively examined as it is encountered.
If not set, then any directories that are found are ignored.
.TP
\f4-ad\fP
Asks the user whether an \f4-r\fP flag applies when a directory is 
discovered.
If the answer does not begin with a ``\f4y\fP'', then the
directory is ignored.
.TP
\f4-v\fP
If the verbose option is set, messages are printed that reveal what the
program is doing.
.TP
\f2source\fP
This may be a file, directory or special file.
It must exist.
If it is not a directory, then the results of the command are the same as
for the \f4cp\fP command.
.br
.ne5
.TP
\f2dest\fP
The destination must be either a file or directory that is different
from the source.
If \f2source\f1 and \f2destination\f1 are anything but
directories, then \f4copy\fP acts just like a \f4cp\fP command.
If
both are directories, then \f4copy\fP copies each file into the
destination directory according to the flags that have been set.
.SH NOTES
Special device files can be copied.
When they are copied, any data
associated with the specified device is not copied.

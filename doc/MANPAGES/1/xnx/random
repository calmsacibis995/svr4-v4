.SH NAME
\f4random\fP \- generate a random number
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4random\f1 [\f4-s\f1] [\f2scale\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4random\fP generates a random number on the standard
output, and returns the number as its exit value.
By default, this
number is either 0 or 1.
If \f2scale\f1 is given a value between
1 and 255, then the range of the random value is from 0 to \f2scale\f1.
If \f2scale\f1 is greater than 255, an error message is printed.
.P
When the \f4-s\fP (silent) option is given, then the random number is
returned as an exit value, but is not printed on the standard output.
If an error occurs, \f4random\fP returns an exit value of zero.
.SH SEE ALSO
\f4rand\fP(3C)
.SH NOTES
This command does not perform any floating point computations.
\f4random\fP uses the time of day as a seed.

.SH NAME
\f4ls\f1, \f4lc\f1 \- list contents of directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4ls\f1
[\f4\-RadLCxmlnogrtucpFbqisf1\f1]
[\f2names\f1]
.br
\f4lc\f1
[\f4-1CFLRabcfgilmnopqrstux\fP] [\f2name. . .\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
For each directory argument,
\f4ls\fP
lists the contents of the directory
for each file argument.
\f4lc\fP functions the same as \f4ls\fP except that the \f4lc\fP
default output format is columnar, even if the output is redirected.
\f4ls\fP
repeats its name and any other information requested.
The output is sorted alphabetically by default.
When no argument is given, the current directory is listed.
When several arguments are given,
the arguments are first sorted appropriately,
but file arguments appear
before directories and their contents.
.PP
There are three major listing formats.
The default format for output directed to a terminal
is multi\-column with entries
sorted down the columns.
The
\f4\-1\f1
option allows single column output
and
\f4\-m\f1
enables stream output format.
In order to determine output formats for the
\f4\-C\f1,
\f4\-x\f1,
and
\f4\-m\f1
options,
\f4ls\fP
uses an environment variable,
\f4COLUMNS\f1,
to determine the number of character positions available on one
output line.
If this variable is not set,
the
\f4terminfo\fP(4)
database is used to determine the number of columns, based on the
environment variable
\f4TERM\f1.
If this information cannot be obtained, 80 columns are assumed.
.PP
The 
\f4ls\fP
command has the following options:
.TP
\f4 \-R\f1
Recursively list subdirectories encountered.
.TP
\f4 \-a\f1
List all entries, including those that begin with a dot (\^\f4.\f1\^), which
are normally not listed.
.TP
\f4 \-d\f1
If an argument is a directory, list only its name
(not its contents);
often used with
\f4\-l\f1
to get the status
of a directory.
.TP
\f4 \-L\f1
If an argument is a symbolic link, list the file or directory
the link references rather than the link itself.
.TP
\f4 \-C\f1
Multi-column output with entries sorted down the columns.
This is the
default output format.
.TP
\f4 \-x\f1
Multi-column output with entries sorted across rather than
down the page.
.TP
\f4 \-m\f1
Stream output format; files are listed across the page, separated by commas.
.TP
\f4 \-l\f1
List in long format, giving mode, number of links, owner, group,
size in bytes, and time of last modification
for each file (see below).
If the file is a special file,
the size field instead contains
the major and minor device numbers rather than a size.
If the file is a symbolic link, the filename is printed
followed by
\f1``\f4->\f1''
and the pathname of the referenced file.
.TP
\f4 \-n\f1
The same as
\f4\-l\f1,
except that the owner's
\f4UID\f1
and group's
\f4GID\f1
numbers are printed, rather than
the associated character strings.
.TP
\f4 \-o\f1
The same as
\f4\-l\f1,
except that the group is not printed.
.TP
\f4 \-g\f1
The same as
\f4\-l\f1,
except that the owner is not printed.
.TP
\f4 \-r\f1
Reverse the order of sort to get reverse alphabetic
or oldest first as appropriate.
.TP
\f4 \-t\f1
Sort by time stamp (latest first) instead of
by name.
The default is the last modification time.
(See \f4\-n\f1 and \f4\-c\f1.)
.TP
\f4 \-u\f1
Use time of last access instead of last
modification for sorting (with the 
\f4\-t\f1
option) or printing (with the
\f4\-l\f1
option).
.TP
\f4 \-c\f1
Use time of last modification of the i-node
(file created, mode changed, etc.) for sorting
\f1(\f4\-t\f1)
or printing
\f1(\f4\-l\f1).
.TP
\f4 \-p\f1
Put a slash
\f1(\f4/\f1)
after each filename if the file is a directory.
.TP
\f4 \-F\f1
Put a slash
\f1(\f4/\f1)
after each filename if the file is a directory,
an asterisk
\f1(\f4*\f1)
if the file is an executable,
and an ampersand
\f1(\f4@\f1)
if the file is a symbolic link.
.TP
\f4 \-b\f1
Force printing of non-printable characters to be in the octal
\f4\e\f2ddd\f1
notation.
.TP
\f4 \-q\f1
Force printing of non-printable characters in file names as
the character question mark
\f1(\f4?\f1).
.TP
\f4 \-i\f1
For each file,
print the i-number in the first column of the report.
.TP
\f4 \-s\f1
Give size in blocks,
including indirect blocks, for each entry.
.TP
\f4 \-f\f1
Force each argument to be interpreted as a directory
and list the name found in each slot.
This option turns off
\f4\-l, \-t, \-s,\f1
and
\f4\-r,\f1
and
turns on
\f4\-a;\f1
the order is the order in which entries
appear in the directory.
.TP
\f4 \-1\f1
Print one entry per line of output.
.PP
The mode printed under the
\f4\-l\f1
option consists of ten characters.
The first character may be one of the following:
.PP
.RS
.PD 0
.TP 4
\f4d\f1
the entry is a directory;
.TP
\f4l\f1
the entry is a symbolic link;
.TP
\f4b\f1
the entry is a block special file;
.TP
\f4c\f1
the entry is a character special file;
.TP
\f4p\f1
the entry is a fifo (named pipe) special file;
.TP
\f4\-\f1
the entry is an ordinary file.
.TP
\f4s\fP
the entry is a \f4XENIX\fP semaphore.
.TP
\f4m\fP
the entry is a \f4XENIX\fP shared data (memory).
.RE
.PD
.PP
The next 9 characters are interpreted
as three sets of three bits each.
The first set refers to the owner's permissions;
the next to permissions of others in the user-group of the file;
and the last to all others.
Within each set, the three characters indicate
permission to read, to write, and to
execute the file as a program, respectively.
For a directory, ``execute'' permission is interpreted
to mean permission to search the directory
for a specified file.
.PP
\f4ls \-l\f1 (the \f4l\f1ong list) prints its output as follows:
.PP
.RS
.ft 4
\-rwxrwxrwx\0\01\0smith\0\0dev\0\0\0\010876\0\0May\016\09:42\0part2
.ft 1
.RE
.PP
Reading from right to left, you see that the current directory holds
one file, named
\f4part2\f1.
Next, the last time that file's contents were modified was 9:42 A.M. on
May 16.
The file contains 10,876 characters, or bytes.
The owner of the file, or the user, belongs to the group
\f4dev\f1
(perhaps indicating ``development''), and his or her login name is
\f4smith\f1.
The number, in this case
\f41\f1,
indicates the number of links to file
\f4part2\f1;
see
\f4cp\fP(1).
Finally, the dash and letters tell you that
user, group, and others
have permissions to read, write, and execute
\f4part2\f1.
.PP
The execute (\f4x\f1)
symbol here occupies the third position of the three-character sequence.
A \f4\-\f1 in the third position would have indicated a denial of
execution permissions.
.PP
The permissions are indicated as follows:
.PP
.RS
.PD 0
.TP 4
\f4r\f1
the file is readable
.TP
\f4w\f1
the file is writable
.TP
\f4x\f1
the file is executable
.TP
\f4\-\f1
the indicated permission is
.I not\^
granted
.TP
\f4l\f1
mandatory locking occurs during access
(the set-group-\s-1ID\s+1 bit
is on and the group execution bit is off)
.TP
\f4s\f1
the \f4s\f1et-user-\s-1ID\s+1 or \f4s\f1et-group-\s-1ID\s+1 bit is on,
and the corresponding user or group execution bit is also on
.TP
\f4S\f1
undefined bit-state (the set-user-\s-1ID\s+1 bit is on
and the user execution bit is off)
.TP
\f4t\f1
the 1000 (octal) bit, or sticky bit, is on [\^see \f4chmod\fP(1)\^],
and execution is on
.TP
\f4T\f1
the 1000 bit is turned on, and execution is off (undefined bit-state)
.RE
.PD
.PP
For user and group permissions,
the third position is sometimes occupied by a character other
than \f4x\f1 or \f4\-\f1.
\f4s\f1 also may occupy this position,
referring to the state of the \f4s\f1et-\s-1ID\s+1 bit, whether it be the
user's or the group's.
The ability to assume the same \s-1ID\s+1 as the user during
execution is, for example, used during login when you begin as root
but need to assume the identity of the user you login as.
.PP
In the case of the sequence of group permissions, \f4l\f1 may occupy
the third position.
\f4l\f1 refers to mandatory file and record \f4l\f1ocking.
This permission describes a file's ability to
allow other files to lock its reading or writing permissions during access.
.PP
For others permissions,
the third position may be occupied by \f4t\f1 or \f4T\f1.
These refer to the state of the sticky bit and execution permissions.
.SH EXAMPLES
An example of a file's permissions is:
.IP
\f4\-rwxr\-\-r\-\-\fP
.PP
This describes a file that is readable, writable, and executable
by the user and readable by the group and others.
.PP
Another example of a file's permissions is:
.IP
\f4\-rwsr\-xr\-x\fP
.PP
This describes a file that is readable, writable, and
executable by the user,
readable and executable by the group and others,
and allows its user-\s-1ID\s+1 to be assumed, during execution,
by the user presently executing it.
.PP
Another example of a file's permissions is:
.IP
\f4\-rw\-rwl\-\-\-\fP
.PP
This 
describes a file that is readable and writable
only by the user and the group and can be locked during access.
.br
.ne 6
.PP
An example of a command line:
.IP
\f4ls \|\-a\f1
.PP
This command prints the names of all files in the current directory,
including those that begin with a dot (\^\f4.\f1\^), which normally
do not print.
.PP
Another example of a command line:
.IP
\f4ls \|\-aisn\f1
.PP
This command provides information
on \f4a\f1ll files, including those that begin with a dot (\f4a\f1),
the \f4i\f1-number\(emthe memory
address of the i-node associated with the file\(emprinted in the left-hand
column (\f4i\f1);
the \f4s\f1ize (in blocks) of the files, printed in the column
to the right of the i-numbers (\f4s\f1);
finally, the report is displayed in the \f4n\f1umeric version of the
long list, printing the \f4\s-1UID\s+1\f1 (instead of user name)
and \f4\s-1GID\s+1\f1 (instead of group name) numbers associated with the files.
.PP
When the sizes of the files in a directory
are listed, a total count of blocks,
including indirect blocks, is printed.

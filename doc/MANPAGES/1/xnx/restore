.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4restore\f1
[\f4\-c\f1]
[\f4\-i\f1]

[\f4\-t\f1]
[\f4\-d \f2device\f1] | [\f2pattern\f1 [\f2pattern\f1]. . .]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.TP
\f4-c\f1
complete restore.
All files on the tape are restored.
.TP
\f4-i\fP
gets the index file off of the medium.
This only works when the archive was created
using \f4backup\fP.
The output is a list of all the files on the medium.
No files are actually restored.
.TP
\f4-o\fP
overwrite existing files.
If the file being restored already exists it
will not be restored unless this option is specified.
.TP
\f4-t\fP
indicates that the tape device is to be used.
Must be used with the \f4-d\fP option when restoring
from tape.
.TP
\f4-d\fP
\f2device\f1 is the raw device to be used.
It defaults to \f4dev/SA/diskette\fP
.P
When doing a restore, one or more patterns can be specified.
These patterns are matched against the files on the tape.
When a match is found, the file is restored.
Since backups are done using full pathnames,
the file is restored to its original directory.
Metacharacters can be used to match multiple files.
The patterns should be in quotes to prevent the
characters from being expanded before they are passed to the
command.
If no patterns are specified, it defaults
to restoring all files.
If a pattern does not match any file on the tape,
a message is printed.
.P
When end of medium is reached, the user is prompted
for the next media.
The user can exit at this point by typing
\f4q\fP.
(This may cause files to be corrupted if a file
happens to span a medium.)
In general, quitting in the middle is not a good idea.
.P
If the file already exists and an attempt is made to
restore it without the \f4-o\f1 option,
the file name will be printed on the screen followed by a
question mark.
This file will not be retored.
.P
In order for multi-volume restores to work correctly,
the raw device must be used.

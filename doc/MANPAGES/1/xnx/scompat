.SH NAME
\f4scompat\f1 \- set up compatibility environment for console applications
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4scompat\f1 [-r \f2interpretnumber\fP] [\f2UNIX System command line\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
COFF- or ELF-based applications developed for SCO UNIX System V/386 3.2
(or later releases) that use graphics may not
work correctly on the system VGA/EGA/CGA console or Fiber Optic
Workstations, which are now STREAMS-based in UNIX System
V/386 Release 4.
.P
The \f4scompat\f1 command sets up the workstation environment
so that these applications may function correctly.
While the environment is in effect, access to the workstation
as a STREAMS device will not work correctly unless the \f4-r\fP
option is used with the argument \f44\fP (see below).
.SH OPTIONS
For COFF or ELF executables,
\f4scompat\f1 may be invoked with no arguments to give you XENIX
\f4ioctl\fP interpretation
[see \f4ioctl\fP(2) in the \f2Programmer's Reference Manual\fP].
In this case, a sub-shell is created.
For the lifetime of the shell,
the compatibility environment is in effect on the workstation.
.P
\f4scompat\fP may also be invoked with the \f4-r\fP
\f2interpretnumber\fP option, where \%\f2interpretnumber\fP is:
.TP
3
UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 \f4ioctl\fP interpretation for XENIX applications
.TP
4
STREAMS \f4ioctl\fP interpretation for COFF executables or XENIX applications
.P
\f4scompat\f1 also accepts as arguments a shell command line
(that is, \f4scompat ls -l\f1).
This results in the command line being
executed with the compatibility environment in effect.
When the command completes execution, the compatibility
environment is restored to its previous state.
.SH NOTES
For computers based on Intel microprocessors,
if \f4SCOMPAT\fP is set to \f43.2\fP, \f4uname -a\fP
gives a value of \f43.2\fP for \f2release\fP and a value of \f42\fP
for \f2version\fP.
.P
To set \f4SCOMPAT\fP to any other version, use the syntax
.P
.RS
\f4SCOMPAT=\f2release\fP:\f2version\f1
.RE
.P
To return to the beginning state, unset \f4SCOMPAT\fP.
.P
In all cases, when \f4SCOMPAT\fP is set, it must be exported [see \f4sh\fP(1) in
the \f2User's Reference Manual\fP].

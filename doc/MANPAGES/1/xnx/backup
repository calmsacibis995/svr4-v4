.SH DESCRIPTION
.TP
\f4-h\fP
produces a history of backups.
Tells the user when the last complete
and incremental/partial backups were done.
.TP
\f4-c\fP
complete backup.
All files changed since the system was installed are backed up.
If an incremental/partial backup was done, all files modified
since that time are backed up,
otherwise all files modified since the last complete backup are backed up.
A complete backup must be done before a partial backup.
.TP
\f4-f\fP
backup files specified by the \f2files\fP argument.
file names may contain characters to be expanded
(that is, *, .) by the shell.
The argument must be in quotes.
.TP
\f4-u\fP
backup a user's home directory.
All files in the user's home directory will be backed up.
At least one user must be specified but it
can be more.
The argument must be in quotes if more than one
user is specified.
If the user name is "all",
then all the user's home directories will be backed up.
.TP
\f4-d\fP
used to specify the device to be used.
It defaults to \f4/dev/SA/diskette\fP.
.TP
\f4-t\fP
used when the device is a tape.
This option must be used with the \f4\-d\fP option
when the tape device is specified.
.P
A complete backup must be done before a partial backup can
be done.
Raw devices rather than block devices should always be used.
The program can handle multi-volume backups.
The program will prompt the user when it is ready for the next
medium.
The program will give you an estimated number of floppies/tapes
that will be needed to do the backup.
Floppies must be formatted before the backup is done.
Tapes do not need to be formatted.
If backup is done to tape, the tape must be rewound.

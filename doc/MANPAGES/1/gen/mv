.SH NAME
\f4mv\fP \- move files
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4mv\fP
[ 
\f4\-f\fP
]
[ 
\f4\-i\fP
]
\f2file1\fP [ \f2file2\f1 ...] \f2target\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4mv\fP command moves
.I filen\^
to
.IR target .
.I filen\^
and
.I target\^
may not have the same name.
(Care must be taken when using
\f4sh\fP(1)
metacharacters).
If
.I target\^
is not a directory, only one file
may be specified before it; if it is
a directory, more than one file
may be specified.
If 
.I target\^
does not exist,
\f4mv\fP creates a file named \f2target\fP.
If 
.I target\^
exists and is not a directory, its contents are overwritten.
If
.I target\^
is a directory
the file(s) are moved to that directory.
.I target
and
.I filen
do not have to share the same parent directory.
.PP
If
\f4mv\fP
determines that the mode of
.I target\^
forbids writing, it will
print the mode [see
\f4chmod\fP(2)],
ask for a response,
and read the standard input for one line.
If the line begins with
\f4y\fP,
the 
\f4mv\fP
occurs, if permissible; otherwise, the command exits.
When the parent directory of \f2filen\fP is
writable and has the sticky bit set, one or more of
the following conditions must be true:
.P
.nf
	the user must own the file
	the user must own the directory
	the file must be writable by the user
	the user must be a privileged user
.fi
.P
The following options are recognized:
.P
.TP
\f4\-i\fP
\f4mv\fP will prompt for confirmation whenever the move
would overwrite an existing \f2target\fP.
A
\f4y\fP
answer means that the move should proceed.  
Any other answer prevents
\f4mv\fP
from overwriting the \f2target\fP.
.TP
\f4\-f\fP
\f4mv\fP will move the file(s) without
prompting even if it is writing
over an existing \f2target\fP.
This option overrides the
\f4\-i\fP
option.
Note that this is the default if the standard input is not a terminal.
.PP
You can use \f4mv\fP to move directories as well as files.
If
.I filen\^
is a directory,
.I target
must be a directory in the same physical file system.
.PP
If 
.I filen
is a file and 
.I target
is a link to another file with links, the other
links remain and
.I target
becomes a new file.
.SH NOTES
If
.I filen\^
and
.I target\^
are on different file systems,
\f4mv\fP
copies the file and deletes the original;
any links to other files are lost.
.PP
A \f4\-\^\-\fP
permits the user to mark explicitly the end of any command
line options, allowing
\f4mv\fP
to recognize filename arguments that begin with a \f4\-\fP.
As an aid to BSD migration, \f4mv\fP will accept \f4\-\fP as
a synonym for \f4\-\^\-\fP.
This migration aid may disappear in a future release.
If a \f4\-\^\-\fP
and a \f4\-\fP
both appear on the same command line, the second will be interpreted as
a filename.

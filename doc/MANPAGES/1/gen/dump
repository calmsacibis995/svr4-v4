.SH NAME
\f4dump\f1 \- dump selected parts of an object file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4dump\f1 [ \f2options\f1 ] \f2files\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4dump\f1
command
dumps selected parts of each
of its object \f2file\fP arguments.
.PP
This command
will accept both object files and archives
of object files.
It processes each file argument according
to one or more of the following options:
.TP \w'\f4\-d~number~~'u
\f4\-a\f1
Dump the archive header of each member of an archive.
.TP
\f4\-C\f1
Dump decoded C++ symbol table names.
.TP
\f4\-c\f1
Dump the string table(s).
.TP
\f4\-D\f1
Dump debugging information.
.TP
\f4\-f\f1
Dump each file header.
.TP
\f4\-g\f1
Dump the global symbols in the symbol table of an archive.
.TP
\f4\-h\f1
Dump the section headers.
.TP
\f4\-L\f1
Dump dynamic linking information and static shared library information, if
available.
.TP
\f4\-l\f1
Dump line number information.
.TP
\f4\-o\f1
Dump each program execution header.
.TP
\f4\-r\f1
Dump relocation information.
.TP
\f4\-s\f1
Dump section contents in hexadecimal.
.TP
\f4\-T \f2index\f1 or \f4\-T \f2index1\f4,\f2index2\f1
Dump only the indexed symbol table entry defined by \f2index\f1
or a range of entries defined by \f2index1\f4,\f2index2\f1.
.TP
\f4\-t\f1
Dump symbol table entries.
.TP
\f4\-u\f1
When reading a \s-1COFF\s0 object file, \f4dump\f1 translates the file to
\s-1ELF\s0
internally (this translation does not affect the file contents).
This option controls how much translation occurs from \s-1COFF\s0
values to \s-1ELF\s0.
Normally (without \f4\-u\f1), the \s-1COFF\s0 values are preserved as much
as possible,
showing the actual bytes in the file.
If \f4\-u\f1 is used, \f4dump\f1 updates the values and completes the
internal translation,
giving a consistent \s-1ELF\s0 view of the contents.
Although the bytes displayed under this option might not match the file
itself,
they show how the file would look if it were converted to \s-1ELF\s0.
(See \f4cof2elf\f1(1) for more information.)
.PP
.TP 12
\f4\-V\f1
Print
version information.
.PP
The following modifiers are used in conjunction with the options
listed above to modify their capabilities.
.TP \w'\f4\-d~number~~'u
\f4\-d\f1~\f2number\f1 or \f4\-d\f1~\f2number1\f4,\f2number2\f1
Dump the section number indicated by \f2number\fP or the range of sections 
starting at \f2number1\fP
and ending at \f2number2\fP.
This modifier can be used with \f4\-h\f1, \f4\-s\f1, and \f4\-r\f1.
When \f4\-d\f1 is used with \f4\-h\f1 or \f4\-s\f1,
the argument is treated as the number of a section or range of sections.
When \f4\-d\f1 is used with \f4\-r\f1,
the argument is treated as the number of the section or range of sections to
which the relocation applies.
For example,
to print out all relocation entries associated with the \f4.text\f1 section,
specify the number of the section as the argument to \f4\-d\f1.
If \f4.text\f1 is section number 2 in the file,
\f4dump~\-r~\-d~2\f1 will print all associated entries.
To print out a specific relocation section use
\f4dump~\-s~\-n~\f2name\f1
for raw data output, or
\f4dump~\-sv~\-n~\f2name\f1
for interpreted output.
.TP
\f4\-n\f1~\f2name\f1
Dump information pertaining only to the named entity.
This
modifier
can be used with
\f4\-h\f1,
\f4\-s\f1,
\f4\-r\f1,
and 
\f4\-t\f1.
When \f4\-n\f1 is used with \f4\-h\f1 or \f4\-s\f1,
the argument will be treated as the name of a section.
When \f4\-n\f1 is used with \f4\-t\f1 or \f4\-r\f1,
the argument will be treated as the name of a symbol.
For example, \f4dump~\-t~\-n~.text\f1 will dump the symbol table entry
associated with the symbol
whose name is \f4.text\f1, where
\f4dump~\-h~\-n~.text\f1
will dump the section header information for the \f4.text\f1
section.
.TP
\f4\-p\f1
Suppress printing of the headings.
.TP
\f4\-v\f1
Dump information in symbolic representation rather than numeric.
This modifier can be used with
\f4\-a\f1 (date, user id, group id),
\f4\-f\f1 (class, data, type, machine, version, flags),
\f4\-h\f1 (type, flags),
\f4\-o\f1 (type, flags),
\f4\-r\f1 (name, type),
\f4\-s\f1 (interpret section contents wherever possible),
\f4\-t\f1 (type, bind), and
\f4\-L\f1 (value).
When \f4\-v\f1 is used with \f4\-s\f1,
all sections that can be interpreted, such as the string table or symbol
table, will be interpreted.
For example,
\f4dump \-sv \-n .symtab \f2files\f1
will produce the same formatted output as
\f4dump \-tv \f2files\f1,
but
\f4dump \-s \-n .symtab \f2files\f1
will print raw data in hexadecimal.
Without additional modifiers,
\f4dump \-sv \f2files\f1
will dump all sections in the files interpreting all those that it can and
dumping the rest (such as \f4.text\f1
or \f4.data\f1)
as raw data.
.PP
The
\f4dump\f1
command
attempts to format the information it dumps in a meaningful way,
printing certain information in character,
hexadecimal, octal or decimal representation as appropriate.

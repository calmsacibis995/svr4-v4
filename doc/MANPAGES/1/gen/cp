.SH NAME
\f4cp\f1 \- copy files
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4cp\f1
[
\f4\-i\f1
]
[
\f4\-p\f1
]
[
\f4\-r\f1
]
\f2file1\f1 [ \f2file2\f1 ...] \f2target\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4cp\fP command copies
.I filen\^
to
.IR target .
.I filen\^
and
.I target\^
may not have the same name.
(Care must be taken when using
\f4sh\fP(1)
metacharacters.)
If
.I target\^
is not a directory, only one file
may be specified before it; if it is
a directory, more than one file
may be specified.
If
.I target\^
does not exist,
\f4cp\fP creates a file named \f2target\f1.
If 
.I target\^
exists and is not a directory, its contents are overwritten.
If
.I target\^
is a directory,
the file(s) are copied to that directory.
.PP
The following options are recognized:
.PP
.TP
\f4\-i\f1
\f4cp\fP will prompt for confirmation whenever the copy
would overwrite an existing \f2target\f1.
A
\f4y\f1
answer means that the copy should proceed.  
Any other answer prevents
\f4cp\fP
from overwriting \f2target\f1.
.TP
\f4\-p\f1
\f4cp\fP will duplicate not only the contents of \f2filen\f1,
but also preserves the modification time and permission modes.
.TP
\f4\-r\f1
If \f2filen\f1 is a directory, \f4cp\fP will copy the directory
and all its files, including any subdirectories and their files;
\f2target\f1 must be a directory.
.PP
If
.I filen\^
is a directory,
.I target
must be a directory in the same physical file system.
.I target
and
.I filen
do not have to share the same parent directory.
.PP
If 
.I filen
is a file and 
.I target
is a link to another file with links, the other
links remain and
.I target
becomes a new file.
.PP
If 
.I target\^
does not exist,
\f4cp\fP creates a new file named \f2target\f1
which has the same mode as  
.I filen\^
except that the sticky bit 
is not set
unless the user is a privileged user;
the owner and group of 
.I target\^
are those of the user.
.PP
If \f2target\f1 is a file, its contents are overwritten, but
the mode, owner, and group associated with it are not changed.
The last modification time
of
.I target\^
and the last access time
of 
.I filen\^
are set to the time the copy was made.
.PP
If \f2target\f1
is a directory,
then for each file named, a new file with the same mode
is created in the target directory;
the owner and the group are those of the user making the copy.
.SH NOTES
A \f4\-\^\-\f1
permits the user to mark the end of any command
line options explicitly, thus allowing 
\f4cp\fP
to recognize filename arguments that begin with a \f4\-\f1.
If a \f4\-\^\-\f1 
and a \f4\-\f1 
both appear on the same command line, the second
will be interpreted as a filename.

.SH NAME
\f4cd\f1 \- change working directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4cd\f1
[ \f2directory\f1 ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
If
\f2directory\fP
is not specified, the value of shell parameter
\f4$HOME\fP
is used as the new working directory.
If
\f2directory\fP
specifies a complete path starting with
\f4/\f1,
\f4\&.\f1,
or
\f4\&.\|.\f1,
\f2directory\fP
becomes the new working directory.
If neither case applies,
\f4cd\fP
tries to find the designated directory relative to one of the
paths specified by the
\f4$CDPATH\fP
shell variable.
\f4$CDPATH\fP
has the same syntax as, and similar semantics to, the
\f4$PATH\fP
shell variable.
\f4cd\fP
must have execute (search) permission in
\f2directory\fP.
.PP
Because a new process is created to execute each command,
\f4cd\fP
would be ineffective if it were written as a
normal command;
therefore, it is recognized by and is internal to
the shell.
.SH SEE ALSO
\f4pwd\fP(1), \f4sh\fP(1).
.br
\f4chdir\fP(2) in the \f2Programmer's Reference Manual\f1.

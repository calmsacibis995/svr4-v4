.SH NAME
\f4as\f1 \- assembler
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4as \f1[\f2options\f1] \f2file\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
\f4as\fP
command
creates object files from assembly language source
\f2files\f1.
.if ''b16' \{\
The output file is executable if no errors
occurred during the assembly, transfer vectors were not used,
and there are no unresolved external references.\}
The following flags
may be specified in any order:
.if ''m32' \{\
.TP 12
\f4\-v\f2 type\f1
type is either an 'x' indicating the original
\f4\f1
assembler or an 'a' indicating the
\f4a\f1
assembler.
\}
.TP 12
\f4\-o\f2 objfile\f1
Put the output of the assembly in
\f2objfile\f1.
By default, the output file name is formed by
removing the 
\f4\&.s\f1
suffix, if there is one, from the input file name
and appending a 
\f4\&.o\f1
suffix.
.if ''x86' \{\
.TP
\f4\-x\f1
This
flag is
\f2required\f1
for all x86 files.
\}
.if ''3b' \{
.TP
\f4\-Q\f1
Warn the user if a transfer vector operand is used
in any context other than a "call" instruction.
\}
.TP
\f4\-n\f1
Turn off long/short address optimization.
By default, address optimization takes place.
.if ''vax' \{\
.TP
\f4\-j\f1
Invoke the long-jump assembler
(for the \s-1VAX\s+1 version of the common assembler only).
The address optimization algorithm chooses between long and short
address lengths, with short lengths chosen when possible.
Often, three distinct lengths are allowed by the machine architecture;
a choice must be made between two of those lengths.
When the two choices given to the assembler exclude the largest length
allowed, then some addresses might be unrepresentable.
The long-jump assembler will always have the largest length as one of
its allowable choices.
If the assembler is invoked without this option, and the case arises
where an address is unrepresentable by either of the two allowed choices,
then the user will be informed of the error, and advised to try again
using the
\f4\-j\f1
option.
\}
.TP
\f4\-m\f1
Run the 
\f4m4\fP
macro processor
on the input to the assembler.
.TP
\f4\-R\f1
Remove (unlink) the input file after assembly
is completed.
.if ''vax' \{\
.TP
\f4\-r\f1
Place all assembled data
(normally placed in the \f4.data\f1 section)
into the \f4.text\f1 section
(for the \s-1VAX\s+1 version of the common assembler only).
This option effectively disables the
\f4\&.data\f1
pseudo operation.
This option is off by default.
\}
.if ''vax' \{\
.TP
\f4\-[bwl]\f1
Create byte
\f1(\f4b\f1),
halfword
\f1(\f4w\f1)
or long
\f1(\f4l\f1)
displacements for undefined symbols
(for the \s-1VAX\s+1 version of the common assembler only).
(An undefined symbol is a reference to a symbol
whose definition is external to the input file or a forward reference.)
The default value for this option is long 
\f1(\f4l\f1)
displacements.
\}
.TP
\f4\-dl\f1
Obsolete.
Assembler issues a warning saying that it is ignoring the \f4\-dl\fP option.
.TP
\f4\-T\f1
Accept obsolete assembler directives.
.TP
\f4\-V\f1
Write the version number of the assembler being run
on the standard error output.
.TP
\f4\-Q\f1{\f4y\f1\||\f4n\f1}
If \f4\-Qy\f1 is specified, place the version number of the
assembler being run in the object file.
The default is
\f4\-Qn\f1.
.TP
\f4\-Y\f1 [\f4md\f1],\f2dir\f1
Find the 
\f4m4\f1
preprocessor
\f1(\f4m\f1)
and/or the file of predefined macros
\f1(\f4d\f1)
in directory
\f2dir\f1
instead of in the customary place.
.SH "FILES"
By default,
\f4as\fP
creates its temporary files in
\f4/var/tmp\fP.
This location can be changed by setting 
the environment variable
\f4TMPDIR\f1
[see \f4tempnam\fP in \f4tmpnam\fP(3S)].
.SH "SEE ALSO"
\f4cc\fP(1),
\f4ld\fP(1),
\f4m4\fP(1),
\f4nm\fP(1),
\f4strip\fP(1),

\f4a.out\fP(4)
.SH NOTES
.if ''3b' \{
.P
If the input file does not contain a 
\f4\&.file\f1
assembler directive and the
\f4\-m\f1
flag was not specified,
the file name given by the assembler when an
error occurs is one of the temporary files
\f1(\f4/var/tmp/as\f1\s-1XXXXXX\s+1)
\}
.P
If the 
\f4\-m\f1
(\f4m4\fP
macro processor invocation) option is used,
keywords for
\f4m4\fP
[see \f4m4\fP(1)]
cannot be used as symbols (variables, functions, labels)
in the input file since
\f4m4\fP
cannot determine which keywords are assembler symbols and 
which keywords are real 
\f4m4\fP
macros.
.if ''vax' \{\
.P
Use the
\f4\-b\f1
or 
\f4\-w\f1
option only when undefined symbols are known to refer to locations
representable by the specified default displacement.
Use of either option when assembling a file containing a reference
to a symbol that is to be resolved by the loader can lead to
unpredictable results,
since the loader may be unable to place the address of the symbol
into the space provided.
\}
.P
The
.if ''b16' \f4\&.even\fP
.if ''x86' \f4\&.even\fP
.if ''3b' \f4\&.align\fP
.if ''m32' \f4\&.through align\fP
.if ''' \f4\&.align\fP
assembler directive may not work
in the
\f4\&.text\f1
section when long/short address
optimization is performed.
.P
Arithmetic expressions may only have
one forward referenced symbol per expression.
.P
Whenever possible, you should access the assembler through a
compilation system interface program such as \f4cc\fP.

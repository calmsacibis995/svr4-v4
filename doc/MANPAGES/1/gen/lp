.SH NAME
\f4lp\f1, \f4cancel\f1 \- send/cancel requests to an \s-1LP\s+1 print service
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4lp\fP [\f2printing-options\fP] [\f2files\fP]
.br
\f4lp\fP \f4-i\fP \f2request-IDs\fP \f2printing-options\fP
.br
\f4cancel\fP [\f2request-IDs\fP] [\f2printers\fP]
.br
\f4cancel \-u\fP \f2login-ID-list\fP [\f2printers\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The first form of the \f4lp\fP command 
arranges for the named \f2files\fP and associated information
(collectively called a
.IR request )
to be printed.
If no file names are specified on the command line,
the standard input is assumed.
The standard input may be specified
along with named \f2files\f1
on the command line by listing the file name(s) and specifying
\f4\-\f1
for the standard input.
The \f2files\f1 will be printed
in the order in which they appear on the shell command line.
.PP
The LP print service
associates a unique \f2request-ID\f1 with each request 
and displays it on the standard output.
This \f2request-ID\f1 can be used later
when canceling or changing a request, or 
when determining its status.
[See the section on \f4cancel\fP for details about canceling a request,
and \f4lpstat\fP(1) for information
about checking the status of a print request.]
.PP
The second form of \f4lp\fP is used to change the options for a request.
The print request identified by
the \f2request-ID\f1 is changed according to the
printing options specified with this shell command.
The printing options available are the same as those
with the first form of the \f4lp\fP shell command.
If the request has
finished printing,
the change is rejected.
If the request is already printing,
it will be stopped and restarted
from the beginning (unless the \f4\-P\f1 option has been given).
.PP
The \f4cancel\fP command allows users to cancel print requests
previously sent with the \f4lp\fP command.
The first form of \f4cancel\fP permits cancellation of requests
based on their \f2request-ID\fP.
The second form of cancel permits cancellation of requests based
on the \f2login-ID\fP of their owner.
.ig
The wait may be considerable if changing a print
request sent to a remote machine.
..
.SS "Sending a Print Request"
The first form of the \f4lp\fP command is used to
send a print request to a particular printer or group of
printers.
.PP
Options to
\f4lp\fP
must always precede file names,
but may be specified in any order.
The following options are available for \f4lp\fP:
.TP .75i
\f4\-c\f1
Make copies
of the
.I files
before printing.
Normally,
.I files
will not be copied,
but will be linked
whenever possible.
If the
\f4\-c\f1
option is not given,
then the user
should be careful
not to remove
any of the
.I files
before the request
has been printed
in its entirety.
It should also be noted
that if the \f4\-c\f1 option is not specified,
any changes made to the named
.I files
after the request
is made
but before it is printed
will be reflected
in the printed output.
.TP
\f4\-d \f2dest\f1
Choose \f2dest\f1 as the printer or class of printers
that is to do the printing.
If \f2dest\f1 is a printer,
then the request will be printed only
on that specific printer.
If \f2dest\f1 is a class of printers,
then the request will be printed on the first
available printer that is a member of the class.
If \f2dest\fP is \f4any\fP, then the request will
be printed on any printer which can handle it.
Under certain conditions
(unavailability of printers,
file space limitations, and so on)
requests for specific destinations
may not be accepted
[see
\f4lpstat\fP(1)].
By default,
.I dest
is taken from
the environment variable
\f4\s-1LPDEST\s+1\f1 (if it is set).
Otherwise, a default destination (if one exists)
for the computer system is used.
Destination names vary between systems
[see \f4lpstat\fP(1)].
.TP
\f4\-f \f2form-name\f1 [\f4\-d any\f1]
Print the request on the form \f2form-name\f1.
The LP print service ensures that the form is mounted on the printer.
If \f2form-name\f1 is requested with a printer destination that cannot support
the form, the request is rejected.
If \f2form-name\f1 has not been defined for the system, 
or if the user is not allowed to use the form, 
the request is rejected [see \f4lpforms\fP(1M)].
When the \f4\-d any\f1 option is given, the request 
is printed on any printer that has the requested form mounted
and can handle all other needs of the print request.
.TP
\f4\-H \f2special-handling\f1
Print the request according to the value of \f2special-handling\f1.
Acceptable values for \f2special-handling\f1 are
defined below:
.RS .75i
.TP .75i
\f4hold\f1
Don't print the request until notified.
If printing has already begun, stop it.
Other print requests will go ahead of a held request until it is resumed.
.TP .75i
\f4resume\f1
Resume a held request.
If it had been printing when held,
it will be the next request printed, unless subsequently bumped by an
\f4immediate\f1 request.
The \f4\-i\fP option (followed by a \f2request-ID\fP)
must be used whenever this argument is specified.
.TP .75i
\f4immediate\f1
(Available only to LP administrators)
.br
Print the request next.
If more than one request is assigned
\f4immediate\f1, the requests are printed in
the reverse order queued.
If a request is currently printing on the desired
printer, you have to put it on hold to allow the
immediate request to print.
.RE
.TP
\f4\-m\f1
Send mail [see \f4mail\f1(1)]
after the files have been printed.
By default, no mail is sent
upon normal completion of the print request.
.TP
\f4\-n \f2number\f1
Print
.I number
copies (default is 1) of the output.
.TP
\f4\-o \f2option\f1
Specify printer-dependent
.IR options .
Several such \f2options\f1
may be collected by specifying 
the \f4\-o\f1 keyletter more than once
(\f4\-o $option sub 1$\f4
\-o $option sub 2$\f2 ... \f4\-o $option sub n$\f1),
or by specifying a list of options 
with one \f4\-o\f1 keyletter enclosed in double quotes
(that is, \f4\-o "$option sub 1$\f4
$option sub 2$\f4 \f2... $option sub n$\f4"\f1).
The standard interface recognizes
the following options:
.RS .75i
.TP .75i
\f4nobanner\f1
Do not print a banner page with this request.
(The administrator can disallow this option at any time.)
.TP .75i
\f4nofilebreak\f1
Do not insert a form feed between the files given,
if submitting a job to print more than one file.
.TP .75i
\f4length\f1=\f2scaled-decimal-number\f1
Print this request with pages
\f2scaled-decimal-number\f1 lines long.
A \f2scaled-decimal-number\f1 is an optionally
scaled decimal number that gives a size in lines,
columns, inches, or centimeters,
as appropriate.
The scale is indicated by appending 
the letter ``i'' for inches,
or the letter ``c'' for centimeters.
For length or width settings, an unscaled number indicates
lines or columns;
for line pitch or character pitch settings, an unscaled number indicates
lines per inch or characters per inch 
(the same as a number scaled with ``i'').
For example, \f4length=66\f1 indicates a page length of 66 lines,
\f4length=11i\f1 indicates a page length of 11 inches, and
\f4length=27.94c\f1 indicates a page length of 27.94 centimeters.
.sp .5
This option may not be used with the \f4\-f\f1 option.
.TP .75i
\f4width\f2=scaled-decimal-number\f1
Print this request with page-width set to 
\f2scaled-decimal-number\f1 columns wide.
(See the explanation of \f2scaled-decimal-numbers\f1
in the discussion of \f4length\f1, above.)
This option may not be used with the \f4\-f\f1 option.
.TP .75i
\f4lpi\f1=\f2scaled-decimal-number\f1
Print this request 
with the line pitch set to
\f2scaled-decimal-number\f1 lines per inch.
This option may not be used with the
\f4\-f\f1 option.
.TP .75i
\f4cpi\f1=\f2scaled-decimal-number\f1
Print this request
with the character pitch set to
\f2scaled-decimal-number\f1 characters per inch.
Character pitch can also be set to
\f4pica\f1 
(representing 10 characters per inch) 
or \f4elite\f1
(representing 12 characters per inch),
or it can be \f4compressed\f1
(representing as many characters as a printer can handle).
There is no standard number of characters per inch for all printers;
see the Terminfo database [\f4terminfo\fP(4)]
for the default character pitch for your printer.
.sp .5
This option may not be used with the
\f4\-f\f1 option.
.TP .75i
\f4stty\f1=\f4'\f2stty-option-list\f4'\f1
A list of options valid for the \f4stty\f1 command;
enclose the list with single quotes if it contains blanks.
.RE
.TP .75i
\f4\-P \f2page-list\f1
Print the pages specified in \f2page-list\f1.
This option can be used only
if there is a filter available to handle it;
otherwise, the print request will be rejected.
.IP
The \f2page-list\f1 may consist of range(s) of numbers,
single page numbers, or
a combination of both.
The pages will be printed in ascending order.
.TP
\f4\-q \f2priority-level\f1
Assign this request \f2priority-level\f1 in the printing queue.
The values of \f2priority-level\f1 range from 0, the highest priority,
to 39, the lowest priority.
If a priority is not specified, the default for the print service is
used, as assigned by the system administrator.
A priority limit may be assigned to individual users by the
system administrator.
.TP
\f4\-s\f1
Suppress messages from \f4lp\f1
such as those that begin with \f4request id is\f1.
.PD 0
.TP
\f4\-S \f2character-set \f1[\f4\-d any\f1]
.TP
\f4\-S \f2print-wheel\f1 [\f4\-d any\f1]
.PD
Print this request using the specified \f2character-set\f1
or \f2print-wheel\f1.
If a form was requested and it requires a character set or
print wheel other than
the one specified with the \f4\-S\f1 option, the
request is rejected.
.IP
For printers that take print wheels:  if
the print wheel specified is not one
listed by the administrator as acceptable 
for the printer specified in this request, 
the request is rejected
unless the print wheel is already mounted on the
printer.
.IP
For printers that use selectable or programmable character sets: if
the \f2character-set\f1 specified is not one
defined in the Terminfo database for the printer [see \f4terminfo\fP(4)],
or is not an alias defined by the administrator,
the request is rejected.
.IP
When the \f4\-d any\f1 option is used, the request
is printed on any printer that
has the print wheel mounted or 
any printer that can select the character set,
and that can handle any other needs of the request.
.TP
\f4\-t \f2title\f1
Print
.I title
on the banner page of the output.
The default is no title.
Enclose \f2title\fP in quotes if it contains blanks.
.TP
\f4\-T \f2content-type\f1 [\f4\-r\f1]
Print the request on a printer that can support 
the specified \f2content-type\f1.
If no printer accepts this type directly,
a filter will be used to convert the content into an acceptable type.
If the \f4\-r\f1 option is specified, a filter will not be used.
If \f4\-r\f1 is specified, and no printer accepts the
\f2content-type\f1 directly, the request is rejected.
If the \f2content-type\f1 is not acceptable to any printer,
either directly or with
a filter, the request is rejected.
.IP
In addition to ensuring that no filters will be used,
the \f4-r\fP option will force the equivalent
of the \f4-o 'stty=-opost' option.
.TP
\f4\-w\f1
Write a message on the user's terminal after the
.I files
have been printed.
If the user is not logged in, 
then mail will be sent instead.
.TP
\f4\-y \f2mode-list\f1
Print this request 
according to the printing modes listed in \f2mode-list\f1.
The allowed values for \f2mode-list\f1 are locally defined.
This option may be used only if there is a filter
available to handle it;
otherwise, the print request will be rejected.
.SS "Canceling a Print Request"
The 
\f4cancel\fP
command cancels requests for print jobs made with the
\f4lp\f1 command.
The first form allows a user to specify one or more \f2request-IDs\fP of
print jobs to be canceled.
Alternatively, the user can specify one or more \f2printers\fP, on
which only the currently printing job will be canceled.
.PP
The second form of \f4cancel\fP permits a user to cancel all of
his or her own jobs on all printers.
In this form the \f2printers\fP option can be used to restrict
the printers on which the user's jobs will be canceled.
Note that in this form, when the \f2printers\fP option is used, all jobs
queued for those printers will be canceled.
A printer class is not a valid argument.
.PP
Users without special privileges can cancel only 
requests associated with their own login IDs.
The system administrator can cancel jobs submitted by any user.
The \f2login-ID-list\fP must be enclosed in quotes if it contains
blanks.
.ig
That is, a user can issue only the following type of command:
.PP
.TP .5i
\f4cancel \-u \f2loginID\f1
Cancels print requests associated with the login_ID 
of the person making the request.
.IP
Administrators and superusers 
(but not users without special privileges) 
can issue the following types of commands to cancel print jobs:
.TP
\f4cancel \-u ``\f2login_ID_list\f1'' all\f1 
Cancels all requests by the specified user(s),
including those for jobs currently being printed.
The argument \f2login_ID_list\f1 
may include any or all of the following constructs: 
.RS .5i
.TP 1.35i
\f2login_ID\f1
A user on the local system
.TP
\f2system_name\f4!\f2login_ID\f1
A user on \f2system_name\f1
.TP
\f2system_name\f4!all\f1
All users on \f2system_name\f1
.TP
\f4all!\f2login_ID\f1
A user not on the local system
.TP
\f4all!all\f1
All users not on the local system
.TP
\f4all\f1
All users on the local system
.RE
.TP .5i
\f4cancel \-u all ``\f2printer_1, printer_2, printer_n''\f1
Cancels all requests for the specified printer(s),
including those for jobs currently being printed.
(For a complete list of printers available on your system,
run the \f4lpstat\f1 command.)
.TP
\f4cancel \-u ``\f2login_ID_list\f1'' printer\f1
Cancels all requests by the specified users for the specified printer,
including those for jobs currently being printed on that printer.
(For a list of acceptable forms of the \f2login_ID_list\f1 argument,
see \f4cancel \-u ``\f2login_ID_list\f1'' above.)
.TP
\f4cancel \-u all all\f1
Cancels all print requests in the system
(that is, requests by \f4all\f1 users for \f4all\f1 printers),
including those for jobs currently being printed.
.TP
\f4cancel \-u all!\f2user_name\f1
Cancels print requests from a user not on the local system
.TP
\f4cancel \-u all!all\f1
Cancels print requests from all users not on the local system
.TP
\f4cancel \-u all\f1
Cancels print requests from all users on the local system
.PP
In any of these cases,
the cancellation of a request that is currently printing
frees the printer to print its next available request.
..
.SH NOTES
Printers for which requests are not being accepted 
will not be considered 
when the \f4lp\f1 command is run and 
the destination is \f4any\f1.
(Use the \f4lpstat \-a\f1 command to see
which printers are accepting requests.)
On the other hand,
if (1) a request is destined
for a class of printers
and (2) the class itself is accepting requests,
then \f2all\f1 printers in the class will be considered,
regardless of their acceptance status.
.PP
For printers that take mountable print wheels or font cartridges,
if you do not specify a particular print wheel or font with the \f4\-S\f1
option, whichever one happens to be mounted at the time your
request is printed will be used.
Use the \f4lpstat \-p \f2printer\f4 \-l\f1 command 
to see which print wheels
are available on a particular printer,
or the \f4lpstat \-S \-l\f1 command to find out
what print wheels are available and on which printers.
For printers that have selectable character sets,
you will get the standard character set
if you don't use the \f4\-S\f1 option.

.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4diff\fP
tells what lines must be changed in two files to bring them
into agreement.
If
.I filename1\^
.RI ( filename2 )
is
\f4\-\f1,
the standard input is used.
If
.I filename1\^
.RI ( filename2 )
is a directory, then a file in that directory with the name
.I filename2\^
.RI ( filename1 )
is used.
The normal output contains lines of these forms:
.IP "" 5
.I n1\^
\f4a\f1
.I n3,n4\^
.br
.I n1,n2\^
\f4d\f1
.I n3\^
.br
.I n1,n2\^
\f4c\f1
.I n3,n4\^
.PP
These lines resemble
\f4ed\fP
commands to convert
.I filename1\^
into
.IR filename2 .
The numbers after the letters pertain to
.IR filename2 .
In fact, by exchanging
\f4a\f1
for
\f4d\f1
and reading backward one may ascertain equally how to convert 
.I filename2\^
into
.IR filename1 .
As in 
\f4ed\fP,
identical pairs, where
.I n1\^
=
.I n2\^
or
.I n3\^
=
.IR n4 ,
are abbreviated as a single number.
.PP
Following each of these lines come all the lines that are
affected in the first file flagged by \f4<\fP, 
then all the lines that are affected in the second file
flagged by \f4>\fP.
.TP
\f4\-b\f1
Ignores trailing blanks (spaces and tabs) and treats 
other strings of blanks as equivalent.
.TP
\f4\-i\f1
Ignores the case of letters; for example,
\f1`\f4A\f1'
will compare equal to
\f1`\f4a\f1'.
.TP
\f4\-t\f1
Expands
.SM TAB
characters in output lines.
Normal or
\f4\-c\f1
output adds character(s) to the
front of each line that may adversely affect the indentation
of the original source lines and make the output lines difficult
to interpret.
This option will preserve the original source's indentation.
.TP
\f4\-w\f1
Ignores all blanks (\s-1SPACE\s+1
and
.SM TAB
characters)
and treats all other strings of blanks as
equivalent;
for example,
\f1`\f4if\ (\ a\ =\|=\ b\ )\f1'
will compare equal to
\f1`\f4if(a=\|=b)\f1'.
.PP
The following options are mutually exclusive:
.TP
\f4\-c\f1
Produces a listing of differences
with three lines of context.
With this option output format is modified slightly:
output begins with identification of the files
involved and their creation dates, then each
change is separated by a line with a dozen 
\f4*\f1's.
The lines removed from
.I filename1
are marked with '\(em'; those added to
.I filename2
are marked '\|+\|'.
Lines that are changed from one file to the
other are marked in both files with '\|!\|'.
.TP
\f4\-C\f2 number\f1
Produces a listing of differences identical
to that produced by
\f4\-c\f1
with
.I number
lines of context.
.TP
\f4\-e\f1
Produces a script of
.IR a,
.IR c ,
and 
.I d\^
commands for the editor
\f4ed\fP,
which will recreate
.I filename2\^
from
.IR filename1 .
In connection with
\f4\-e\f1,
the following shell program may help maintain
multiple versions of a file.
Only an ancestral file ($1) and a chain of 
version-to-version
\f4ed\fP
scripts ($2,$3,...) made by
\f4diff\fP
need be on hand.
A ``latest version'' appears on
the standard output.
.IP "" 5
\f4(shift; cat $\(**; echo \(fm1,$p\(fm) \(bv ed \- $1\f1
.PP
Except in rare circumstances,
\f4diff\fP
finds a smallest sufficient set of file
differences.
.TP
\f4\-f\f1
Produces a similar script,
not useful with
\f4ed\fP,
in the opposite order.
.TP
\f4\-h\f1
Does a fast, half-hearted job.
It works only when changed stretches are short
and well separated,
but does work on files of unlimited length.
Options 
\f4\-e\f1
and
\f4\-f\f1
are unavailable with
\f4\-h\f1.
.TP
\f4\-n\f1
Produces a script similar to
\f4\-e\f1,
but in the opposite order and with a count
of changed lines on each insert or delete
command.
.TP
\f4\-D\f2 string\f1
Creates a merged version of
.I filename1
and
.I filename2
with C preprocessor controls
included so that a compilation of the result without
defining
.I string
is equivalent to compiling
.IR filename1 ,
while defining
.I string
will yield
.IR filename2 .
.PP
The following options are used for
comparing directories:
.TP
\f4\-l\f1
Produce output in long format.
Before the \f4diff\f1, each text file
is piped through
\f4pr\f1(1)
to paginate it.
Other differences
are remembered and summarized after all text file
differences are reported.
.TP
\f4\-r\f1
Applies
\f4diff\f1
recursively to common subdirectories
encountered.
.TP
\f4\-s\f1
Reports files that are the
identical; these would not otherwise
be mentioned.
.TP
\f4\-S\f2 name\f1
Starts a directory
\f4diff\f1
in the middle, beginning with the
file
.IR name .
.SH FILES

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Exit status is 0 for no differences, 1 for some differences, 2 for trouble.
.SH NOTES
Editing scripts produced under the
\f4\-e\f1 or
\f4\-f\f1 option are naive about
creating lines consisting of a single period (\f4.\fP).
.P
\f4Missing newline at end of file X\f1
.br
indicates that the last line of file X did not have a new-line.
If the lines are different, they will be flagged and output;
although the output will seem to indicate they are the same.

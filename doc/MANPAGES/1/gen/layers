.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4layers\fP
manages asynchronous windows [see \f4layers\fP(5)] on a windowing terminal.
Upon invocation, \f4layers\fP finds an unused 
\f4xt\fP(7)
channel group and associates it with the terminal line on its
standard output.
It then waits for commands from the terminal.
.PP
Command-line options:
.TP 8
\f4\-s\f1
Report protocol statistics on standard error
at the end of the session after you exit from \f4layers\fP.
The statistics may be printed
during a session by invoking the program
\f4xts\fP(1M).
.TP
\f4\-t\f1
Turn on \f4xt\fP(7) driver packet tracing, and produces a trace dump
on standard error at the end of the session after you exit from \f4layers\fP.
The trace dump may be printed
during a session by invoking the program
\f4xtt\fP(1M).
.TP
\f4\-D\f1
Send debugging messages to standard error.
.TP
\f4\-m\f1 \f2max-pkt\f1
Set maximum size for the data part of regular \f4xt\fP packets sent from the host 
to the terminal.
Valid values are 32 to 252.
This option also implies that regular rather than network \f4xt\f1 protocol
should be used.
See \f4xtproto\fP(5).
.TP
\f4\-d\f1
If a firmware patch has been downloaded,
print out the sizes of the text, data,
and bss portions of the firmware patch
on standard error.
.TP
\f4\-p\f1
If a firmware patch has been downloaded,
print the down-loading protocol statistics and a trace
on standard error.
.TP
\f4\-h\f1 \f2modlist\f1
Push a list of \s-1STREAMS\s0 modules separated by a comma on a layer.
.TP
\f4\-f\f2 file\f1
Start \f4layers\fP with an initial configuration
specified by \f2file\f1.
Each line of the file represents a layer to be
created, and has the following format:
.IP "" 10
\f2origin_x origin_y corner_x corner_y command_list\fP
.IP "" 8
The coordinates specify the size and position of the layer
on the screen in the terminal's coordinate
system.
If all four are \f40\f1, the user must define
the layer interactively.
\f2command_list\f1,
a list of one or more commands,
must be provided.
It is executed in the new layer using the user's shell
(by executing: \f4$SHELL -i -c "\f2command_list\f4"\f1).
This means that the last command should invoke a shell, such as \f4/usr/bin/sh\f1.
(If the last command is not a shell,
then, when the last command has completed,
the layer will not be functional.)
.TP
.I layersys-prgm
A file containing a firmware patch that the
\f4layers\fP
command downloads to the terminal before layers are created and
.I "command_list"
is executed.
.PP
Each layer is in most ways functionally identical to a separate terminal.
Characters typed on the keyboard are sent to the standard input of
the \s-1UNIX\s0 system process attached to the current
layer (called the host process), and characters written on the
standard output by the host process appear in that layer.
When a layer is created, a separate shell is established and bound
to the layer.
If the environment variable \f4SHELL\f1 is set, the user
gets that shell: otherwise, \f4/usr/bin/sh\fP is used.
In order to enable communications with other users via
\f4write\fP(1),
\f4layers\fP
invokes the command
\f4relogin\fP(1M)
when the first layer is created.
\f4relogin\fP(1M)
will reassign that layer as the user's logged-in terminal.
An alternative layer can be designated by using
\f4relogin\fP(1M)
directly.
\f4layers\fP
will restore the original assignment on termination.
.PP
Layers are created, deleted, reshaped,
and otherwise manipulated in a terminal-dependent manner.
For instance, the \s-1AT&T\s0  630 \s-1MTG\s0 terminal provides
a mouse-activated pop-up menu of layer operations.
The method of ending a \f4layers\fP session is also
defined by the terminal.
.P
If a user wishes to take advantage of a terminal-specific
application software package, the
environment variable
\f4DMD\f1
should be set to the path name of the directory where the package
was installed.
Otherwise \f4DMD\f1 should not be set.
.SH EXAMPLES
A typical startup command is:
.P
.RS
.ft 4
layers -f startup
.ft 1
.RE
.P
where
\f4startup\f1
contains
.P
.RS
\f48 8 700 200 date ; pwd ; exec $SHELL
.br
8 300 780 850 exec $SHELL\fP
.RE
.P
The command
.P
.RS
\f4layers -h FILTER,LDTERM\fP
.RE
.P
pushes the \s-1STREAMS\s0 modules \f4FILTER\fP and \f4LDTERM\fP
on each layer that is opened.

.SH NOTES
The \f4xt\fP(7) driver supports an alternate
data transmission scheme known as \s-1ENCODING MODE\s0.
This mode makes \f4layers\fP operation possible even
over data links which intercept control characters or
do not transmit 8-bit characters.
\s-1ENCODING MODE\s0 is selected either by
setting a setup option on your windowing terminal
or by setting the environment variable
\f4DMDLOAD\f1 to the value \f4hex\f1 before
running \f4layers\fP:
.P
.RS
\f4DMDLOAD=hex; export DMDLOAD\f1
.RE
.P
If, after executing \f4layers -f\f2 file\f1, the terminal does not respond in
one or more of the layers, often the last command in the \f2command_list\f1
for that layer did not invoke a shell.
.PP
To access this version of \f4layers\fP,
make sure \f4/usr/bin\f1
appears before any other directory,
such as \f4$DMD/bin\f1,
you have in your path that contains a layers
program.
[For information about defining the shell
environmental variable
\f4PATH\f1
in your \f4.profile\f1, see \f4profile\fP(4).]
Otherwise, if there is a terminal-dependent
version of \f4layers\fP, you may get it instead of the correct one.
.PP
\f4layers\fP sends all debugging and error messages to standard error.
Therefore, when invoking \f4layers\f1 with the \f4\-D, \-d\fP, or \f4\-p\fP
option, it is necessary to redirect standard error to a file.
For example,
.P
.RS
\f4layers -D 2>layers.msgs\fP
.RE
.PP
If \f4layers\fP encounters an error condition and standard error is not redirected,
the last error encountered will be printed when the \f4layers\fP commands exits.
.PP
When using \f4layers\f1 the mimimum acceptable baud rate is 1200.
Behavior of \f4layers\fP is unpredictable when using baud rate below 1200.
.PP
When using V7\/\s-1BSD\s0\/Xenix applications (for example, the \f4jim\fP editor) \f4layers\fP should
be invoked as
.P
.RS
\f4layers -h ldterm,ttcompat\fP
.RE
.P
This pushes the \f4ttcompat\fP module on each window and converts the \s-1BSD\s0
interface into the \f4termio\fP(7) interface.

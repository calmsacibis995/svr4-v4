.SH NAME
\f4fmt\f1 \- simple text formatters
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4fmt\f1 [ \f4\-cs\f1 ] [ \f4\-w\f2 width\f1 ] [ \f2file\f1  .\ .\ . ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4fmt \f1
is a simple text formatter that fills and joins lines 
to produce output lines of (up to) the number of characters
specified in the
\f4\-w\f2 width\f1
option.
The default 
.I width
is 72.
\f4fmt\f1
concatenates the
.IR inputfile s
listed as arguments.
If none are given,
\f4fmt\f1
formats text from the standard input.
.PP
Blank lines are preserved in the output, as is the
spacing between words.
\f4fmt\f1
does not fill lines beginning with a ``\f4.\fP'' (dot),
for compatibility with 
\f4nroff\f1(1).
Nor does it fill lines starting with
``\f4From:\f1''.
.PP
Indentation is preserved in the output, and input lines with differing
indentation are not joined (unless
\f4\-c\f1
is used).
.PP
\f4fmt\f1
can also be used as an in-line text filter for
\f4vi\f1(1);
the 
\f4vi\f1
command:
.IP
\f4!}fmt\f1
.PP
reformats the text between the cursor location and the end of
the paragraph.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 12
\f4\-c\f1
Crown margin mode.
Preserve the indentation of the first two lines within a
paragraph, and align the left
margin of each subsequent line with that of the second line.
This is useful for tagged paragraphs.
.TP
\f4\-s\f1
Split lines only.
Do not join short lines to form longer ones.
This prevents sample lines of code, and other such \(lqformatted\(rq text,
from being unduly combined.
.TP
\f4\-w\f2 width\f1
Fill output lines to up to 
.I width
columns.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
\f4nroff\fP(1),
\f4vi\fP(1)
.SH NOTES
The
\f4\-w\f2 width\f1
option is acceptable for
.SM BSD
compatibility, but it may go away in future releases.

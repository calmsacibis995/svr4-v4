.SH NAME
\f4dpost\fP \- \f4troff\fP postprocessor for PostScript printers
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/usr/lib/lp/postscript/dpost\fP [\f2options\fP] [\f2files\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4dpost\fP translates
.I files
created by \f4troff\fP(1)
into PostScript and writes the results on the
standard output.
If no
.I files
are specified, or if \- is one of the input
.I files,
the standard input is read.
The following
.I options
are understood:
.TP 1.0i
\f4\-c \f2num\f1
Print
.I num
copies of each page.
By default only one copy is printed.
.TP 1.0i
\f4\-e \f2num\f1
Sets the text encoding level to \f2num\f1.
The recognized choices are 0, 1, and 2.
The size of the output file and print time should
decrease as
.I num
increases.
Level 2 encoding will typically be about 20 percent faster than
level 0, which is the default and produces output essentially
identical to previous versions of
\f4dpost\fP.
.TP 1.0i
\f4\-m \f2num\fP
Magnify each logical page by the factor
\f2num\fP.
Pages are scaled uniformly about the origin,
which is located near the upper left corner of
each page.
The default magnification is 1.0.
.TP 1.0i
\f4\-n\fP \f2num\fP
Print
.I num
logical pages on each piece of paper,
where
.I num
can be any positive integer.
By default,
.I num
is set to 1.
.TP 1.0i
\f4\-o\fP \f2list\fP
Print those pages for which numbers are given in the comma-separated
\f2list\fP.
The list contains single numbers
.I N
and ranges
.IB N1 \- N2.
A missing
.I N1
means the lowest numbered page, a missing
.I N2
means the highest.
.TP 1.0i
\f4\-p \f2mode\f1
Print
.I files
in either portrait or landscape
.I mode.
Only the first character of
.I mode
is significant.
The default
.I mode
is portrait.
.TP 1.0i
\f4\-w \f2num\f1
Set the line width used to implement
.I troff
graphics commands to
.I num
points, where a point is approximately 1/72
of an inch.
By default,
.I num
is set to 0.3 points.
.TP 1.0i
\f4\-x \f2num\f1
Translate the origin
.I num
inches along the positive x axis.
The default
coordinate system has the origin fixed near the
upper left corner of the page, with positive
x to the right and positive y down the page.
Positive
.I num
moves everything right.
The default offset is 0 inches.
.TP 1.0i
\f4\-y \f2num\f1
Translate the origin
.I num
inches along the positive y axis.
Positive
.I num
moves text up the page.
The default offset is 0.
.TP 1.0i
\f4\-F d\f2ir\f1
Use
.I dir
as the font directory.
The default
.I dir
is \f4/usr/lib/font\f1, and
.I dpost
reads binary font files from directory
\f4/usr/lib/font/devpost\f1.
.TP 1.0i
\f4\-H \f2dir\f1
Use
.I dir
as the host resident font directory.
Files in this directory should be complete PostScript font descriptions,
and must be assigned a name that corresponds to the appropriate
two-character
\f4troff\fP
font name.
Each font file is copied to the output file only when needed
and at most once during each job.
There is no default directory.
.TP 1.0i
\f4\-L \f2file\f1
Use
.I file
as the PostScript prologue
which, by default, is \f4/usr/lib/postscript/dpost.ps\fP.
.TP 1.0i
\f4\-O\fP
Disables PostScript picture inclusion.
A recommended option when
\f4dpost\fP
is run by a spooler in a networked environment.
.TP 1.0i
\f4\-T \f2name\fP
Use font files for device
.I name
as the best description of available PostScript fonts.
By default,
.I name
is set to \f4post\fP and \f4dpost\fP
reads binary files from \f4/usr/lib/font/devpost\fP.
.PP
The
.I files
should be prepared by \f4troff\fP.
The default font files in \f4/usr/lib/font/devpost\fP produce the
best and most efficient output.
They assume a resolution of 720 dpi, and can be used
to format files by adding the
\f4\-Tpost\fP
option to the \f4troff\fP call.
Older versions of the
\f4eqn\fP and \f4pic\fP
preprocessors need to know the resolution that
\f4troff\fP will be using to format the
.I files.
If those are the versions installed on your system,
use the \f4\-r720\fP option with \f4eqn\fP 
and \f4\-T720\fP with \f4pic\fP.
.PP
\f4dpost\fP makes no assumptions about resolutions.
The first
\&\f4x res\fP
command sets the resolution used
to translate the input
.I files,
the \f4DESC.out\fP file,
usually \f4/usr/lib/font/devpost/DESC.out\fP,
defines the resolution used in the binary font files,
and the PostScript prologue is responsible for setting up
an appropriate user coordinate system.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
If the old versions of \f4eqn\fP and \f4pic\fP
are installed on your system,
you can obtain the best possible looking output
by issuing a command line such as the following:
.PP
.RS
\f4pic -T720 \f2file\fP | tbl | eqn -r720 | troff -mm -Tpost | dpost\f1
.RE
.PP
Otherwise,
.PP
.RS
\f4pic \f2file\fP | tbl | eqn | troff -mm -Tpost | dpost\f1
.RE
.PP
should give the best results.
.SH NOTES
.PP
Output files
often do not conform to Adobe's file structuring conventions.
Piping the output of \f4dpost\fP
through \f4postreverse\fP
should produce a minimally conforming PostScript file.
.PP
Although \f4dpost\fP
can handle files formatted for any device,
emulation is expensive and
can easily double the print time and the size of the output file.
No attempt has been made to implement the character sets
or fonts available on all devices supported by
\f4troff\fP.
Missing characters will be replaced by white space,
and unrecognized fonts will usually default to one
of the Times fonts (that is, \f4R\fP, \f4I\fP, \f4B\fP, or \f4BI\fP).
.PP
An
\&\f4x res\fP command 
must precede the first \&\f4x init\fP command,
and all the input
.I files
should have been prepared for the same output device.
.PP
Use of the \f4\-T\fP option is not encouraged.
Its only purpose is to enable the use of other
PostScript font and device description files, that perhaps use
different resolutions, character sets, or fonts.
.PP
Although level 0 encoding is the only scheme that has been thoroughly
tested, level 2 is fast and may be worth a try.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
An exit status of 0 is returned if
.I files
have been translated successfully,
while 2 often indicates a syntax error in the input
.I files.

.SH NAME
\f4download\fP \- host resident PostScript font downloader
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4download\fP [\f2options\fP] [\f2files\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4download\fP prepends host resident fonts to
.I files
and writes the results on the standard output.
If no
.I files
are specified, or if \f4\-\fP is one of the input
.I files,
the standard input is read.
\f4download\fP
assumes the input
.I files
make up a single PostScript job and that requested fonts
can be included at the start of each input
.I file.
The following
.I options
are understood:
.TP 12n
\f4\-f\fP
Force a complete scan of each input
.I file.
In the absence of an explicit comment pointing
\f4download\fP
to the end of the file, the default scan stops
immediately after the PostScript header comments.
.TP
\f4\-p\fP \f2printer\fP
Before downloading,
check the list of printer-resident fonts
in \f4/etc/lp/printers/\f2printer\f4/residentfonts\f1.
.TP
\f4\-m\fP \f2name\fP
Use
.I name
as the font map table.
A
.I name
that begins with \f4/\fP is the full pathname of the
map table and is used as is.
Otherwise
.I name
is appended to the pathname of the host font directory.
.TP
\f4\-H\fP \f2dir\fP
Use
.I dir
as the host font directory.
The default is \f4/usr/lib/lp/postscript\fP.
.PP
Requested fonts are named in
a comment (marked with \f4%%DocumentFonts:\fP)
in the input
.IR files .
Available fonts are the ones listed in the map table
selected using the
\f4\-m\fP
option.
.PP
The map table consists of fontname\-filename pairs.
The fontname is the full name of the PostScript font,
exactly as it would appear in a \&\f4%%DocumentFonts:\fP
comment.
The filename is the pathname of the host resident font.
A filename that begins with a \f4/\fP is used as is.
Otherwise the pathname is relative to the host font
directory.
Comments are introduced by % (as in PostScript) and
extend to the end of the line.
.PP
The only candidates for downloading are
fonts listed in the map table
that point \f4download\fP to readable files.
A font is downloaded once, at most.
Requests for unlisted fonts or inaccessible files
are ignored.
All requests are ignored if the map table can't be read.
.SH EXAMPLES
The following
map table could be used to control the downloading
of the Bookman font family:
.P
.ft4
.nf

  %
  % The first string is the full PostScript font name.
  % The second string is the file name - relative to the
  % host font directory unless it begins with a /.
  %
    Bookman-Light            bookman/light
    Bookman-LightItalic      bookman/lightitalic
    Bookman-Demi             bookman/demi
    Bookman-DemiItalic       bookman/demiitalic
.fi
.ps
.ft
.PP
Using the file \f4myprinter/map\fP
(in the default host font directory)
as the map table,
you could download fonts
by issuing the following command:
.PP
.RS
\f4download \-m\fP \f2myprinter/map file\fP
.RE
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
An exit status of \f40\fP is returned if
.I files
were successfully processed.
.SH NOTES
The \f4download\fP program
should be part of a more general program.
.PP
\f4download\fP
does not look for \&\f4%%PageFonts:\fP comments
and there is no way to force multiple downloads of
a particular font.
.PP
We do not recommend the use of full pathnames
in either map tables or the names of map tables.

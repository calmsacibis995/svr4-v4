.SH NAME
\f4tftp\f1 \- trivial file transfer program
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4tftp\f1
[
.I host
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\f4tftp\f1
is the user interface to the Internet
.SM TFTP
(Trivial File Transfer Protocol),
which allows users to transfer files to and from a remote machine.
The remote
.I host
may be specified on the command line, in which case
\f4tftp\f1
uses
.I host
as the default host for future transfers (see the
\f4connect\f1
command below).
.SH USAGE
.SS Commands
Once
\f4tftp\f1
is running, it issues the prompt
\f4tftp>\f1
and recognizes the following commands:
.TP .6i
\f4connect \f2host-name\fP [ \f2port\fP ]\f1
Set the
.I host
(and optionally
\f2port\f1)
for transfers.
The
.SM TFTP
protocol, unlike the
.SM FTP
protocol, does not maintain connections between transfers; thus, the
\f4connect\f1
command does not actually create a connection,
but merely remembers what host is to be used for transfers.
You do not have to use the
\f4connect\f1
command; the remote host can be specified as part of the
\f4get\f1
or
\f4put\f1
commands.
.TP
\f4mode \f2transfer-mode\f1
Set the mode for transfers;
.I transfer-mode
may be one of
\f4ascii\f1
or
\f4binary\f1.
The default is
\f4ascii\f1.
.TP
\f4put \f2filename\f1
.PD 0
.TP
\f4put \f2localfile remotefile\f1
.TP
.PD
\f4put\fP \fIfilename1 filename2 .\|.\|. filenameN remote-directory\fP
Transfer a file, or a set of files, to the specified
remote file or directory.  The destination
can be in one of two forms:
a filename on the remote host if the host has already been specified,
or a string of the form
.RS
.IP
\f2host\f4:\f2filename\f1
.RE
.IP
to specify both a host and filename at the same time.
If the latter form is used,
the specified host becomes the default for future transfers.
If the remote-directory form is used, the remote host is
assumed to be running the
.SM UNIX
system.
.PD 0
.TP
\f4get \f2filename\f1
.TP
\f4get \f2remotename localname\f1
.TP
.PD
\f4get \f2filename1 filename2 filename3\f1 .\|.\|. \f2filenameN\f1
Get a file or set of files (three or more) from the specified remote
.IR sources .
.I source
can be in one of two forms:
a filename on the remote host if the host has already been specified,
or a string of the form
.RS
.IP
\f2host\f4:\f2filename\f1
.RE
.IP
to specify both a host and filename at the same time.
If the latter form is used,
the last host specified becomes the default for future transfers.
.TP .6i
\f4quit\f1
Exit
\f4tftp\f1.
An
.SM EOF
also exits.
.TP
\f4verbose\f1
Toggle verbose mode.
.TP
\f4trace\f1
Toggle packet tracing.
.TP
\f4status\f1
Show current status.
.TP
\f4rexmt \f2retransmission-timeout\f1
Set the per-packet retransmission timeout, in seconds.
.br
.ne 5
.TP
\f4timeout \f2total-transmission-timeout\f1
Set the total transmission timeout, in seconds.
.TP
\f4ascii\f1
Shorthand for
\f4mode ascii\f1.
.TP
\f4binary\f1
Shorthand for
\f4mode binary\f1.
.TP
\f4? [  \f2command-name\fP .\|.\|. ]
Print help information.
.SH NOTES
.LP
Because there is no user-login or validation within
the
.SM TFTP
protocol, many remote sites restrict file access in various ways.
Approved methods for file access are specific to each site, and
therefore cannot be documented here.
.LP
When using the \f4get\f1 command to transfer multiple files
from a remote host, three or more files must be
specified.  The command returns an error message if
only two files are specified.

\f4cdc\f1 \- change the delta comment of an \s-1SCCS\s+1 delta
.SH SYNOPSIS
.na
\f4cdc \-r
\f2SID\f1

]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4cdc\fP
changes the
delta comment,
for the \s-1SID\s+1 (\s-1SCCS\s+1 identification string) specified by the
\f4\-r\f1
keyletter,
of each
named \s-1SCCS\s+1 file.
.PP
The delta comment is the Modification Request (\s-1MR\s+1) and comment
information normally specified via the
\f4\-m\f1
and
\f4\-y\f1
keyletters of the
\f4delta\fP
command.
.PP
If
\f2file\f1
is a directory,
\f4cdc\fP
behaves as though each file in the directory were
specified as a named file,
except that non-\s-1SCCS\s+1 files
(last component of the path name does not begin with \f4s.\f1)
and unreadable files
are silently ignored.
If a name of
\f4\-\f1
is given, the standard input is read (see the
.SM NOTES
section)
and each line of the standard input is taken to be the name of an \s-1SCCS\s+1 file
to be processed.
.PP
Arguments to
\f4cdc\fP,
which may appear in any order, consist of
keyletter
arguments and file names.
.PP
All the described
keyletter
arguments apply independently to each named file:
.RS 3
.TP 12
\f4\-r\f2\s-1SID\s+1\f1
Used
to specify the \f2S\f1CCS \f2ID\f1entification
(\s-1SID\s+1)
string
of a delta for
which the delta comment is to be changed.
.TP
\f4\-m\f2mrlist\f1
If
the \s-1SCCS\s+1 file has the
\f4v\f1
flag set
[see
\f4admin\fP(1)]
then a
list of \s-1MR\s+1 numbers to be added and/or deleted in
the delta comment of
the \s-1SID\s+1 specified by the
\f4\-r\f1
keyletter
may
be supplied.
A null \s-1MR\s+1 list has no effect.
.IP
\f2mrlist\f1
entries are added to the list of \s-1MR\s+1s in the same manner as that of
\f4delta\fP.
In order to delete an \s-1MR\s+1, precede the \s-1MR\s+1 number
with the character \f4!\f1 (see the
.SM EXAMPLES
section).
If the \s-1MR\s+1 to be deleted is currently in the list of \s-1MR\s+1s, it is
removed
and changed into a comment line.
A list of all deleted \s-1MR\s+1s is placed in the comment section
of the delta comment and preceded by a comment line stating
that they were deleted.
.IP
If
\f4\-m\f1
is not used and the standard input is a terminal, the prompt
\f4\s-1MR\s+1s?\f1
is issued on the standard output before the standard input
is read; if the standard input is not a terminal, no prompt is issued.
The \f4\s-1MR\s+1s?\f1 prompt always precedes the \f4comments?\f1 prompt
(see
\f4\-y\f1
keyletter).
.IP
\f2mrlist\f1
entries in a list are separated by blanks and/or tab characters.
An unescaped new-line character terminates the \s-1MR\s+1 list.
.IP
Note that if the
\f4v\f1
flag has a value
[see
\f4admin\fP(1)],
it is taken to be the name of a program (or shell procedure) that validates
the correctness of the \s-1MR\s+1 numbers.
If a non-zero exit status is returned from the \s-1MR\s+1 number validation program,
\f4cdc\fP
terminates
and the delta comment remains unchanged.
.TP
\f4\-y\f1[comment]
Arbitrary
text used to replace the \f2comment\^\f1(s) already existing
for the delta specified by the
\f4\-r\f1
keyletter.
The previous comments are kept and preceded by a comment
line stating that they were changed.
A null \f2comment\^\f1 has no effect.
.IP
If
\f4\-y\f1
is not specified and the standard input is a terminal, the
prompt \f4comments?\f1 is issued on the standard output before
the standard input is read;
if the standard input is not a terminal, no prompt is issued.
An unescaped new-line character terminates the \f2comment\^\f1 text.
.RE

.PP
If you made the delta and have the appropriate file permissions,
you can change its delta comment.
If you own the file and directory you can modify the delta comment.

.SH NOTES
If \s-1SCCS\s+1 file names are supplied to the
\f4cdc\fP
command via the standard input
(\f4\-\f1 on the command line),
then the
\f4\-m\f1
and
\f4\-y\f1
keyletters must also be used.

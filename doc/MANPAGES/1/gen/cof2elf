.SH NAME
\f4cof2elf\f1 \- COFF to ELF object file translation
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4cof2elf [\-iqV] [\-Q{yn}] [\-s \f2directory\f4] \f2files\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4cof2elf\f1
converts one or more COFF object
\f2files\f1
to ELF.
This translation occurs in place, meaning the original
file contents are modified.
If an input file is an archive, each
member will be translated as necessary,
and the archive will be rebuilt with its members in the original order.
\f4cof2elf\f1
does not change input files that are not COFF.
.P
Options have the following meanings.
.TP 12
\f4\-i\f1
Normally, the files are modified only when full translation occurs.
Unrecognized data, such as unknown relocation types, are treated
as errors and prevent translation.
Giving the
\f4\-i\f1
flag ignores these partial translation conditions and modifies
the file anyway.
.TP
\f4\-q\f1
Normally,
\f4cof2elf\f1
prints a message for each file it examines, telling
whether the file was translated, ignored, etc.
The
\f4\-q\f1
flag (for quiet) suppresses these messages.
.TP
\f4\-Q\f2arg\f1
If
\f2arg\f1
is
\f4y\f1,
identification information about
\f4cof2elf\f1
will be added to the output files.
This can be useful for software administration.
Giving
\f4n\f1
for
\f2arg\f1
explicitly asks for no such information, which is
the default behavior.
.TP
\f4\-s\f2directory\fP
As mentioned above,
\f4cof2elf\f1
modifies the input files.
This option saves a copy of the original files in the specified
\f2directory\fP,
which must exist.
\f4cof2elf\f1
does not save files it does not modify.
.TP
\f4\-V\f1
This flag tells
\f4cof2elf\f1
to print a version message on standard error.

.SH NOTES
Some debugging information is discarded.
Although this does not affect the behavior of a running program,
it may affect the information available for symbolic debugging.
.P
\f4cof2elf\f1
translates only COFF relocatable files.
It does not translate executable or static shared library files
for two main reasons.
First, the operating system supports executable files and
static shared libraries, making translation unnecessary.
Second, those files have specific address and alignment constraints
determined by the file format.
Matching the constraints with a different object file format
is problematic.
.P
When possible, programmers should recompile their source
code to build new object files.
\f4cof2elf\f1
is provided for those times when source code is unavailable.

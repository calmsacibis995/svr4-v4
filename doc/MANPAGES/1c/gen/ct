.SH NAME
\f4ct\f1 \- spawn login to a remote terminal
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4ct\f1 [\f2options\f1] \f2telno\f1 . . .
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4ct\fP
dials the telephone number of a modem that is attached to a terminal and
spawns a
\f4login\fP
process to that terminal.
.I Telno\^
is a telephone number,
with equal signs for secondary dial tones and minus
signs for delays at appropriate places.
(The set of legal characters for \f2telno\f1 is
\f40\fP through \f49\fP, \f4\-\fP, \f4=\fP, \f4\(***\fP,
and \f4#\fP.
The maximum length of
.I telno
is 31 characters).
If more than one telephone number is specified,
\f4ct\fP
tries each in succession until one answers;
this is useful for specifying alternate dialing paths.
.PP
\f4ct\fP
tries each line listed in the file
\f4/etc/uucp/Devices\f1
until it finds an available line with appropriate
attributes, or runs out of entries.
.\"	Commented out for 3B 2-->Inapplicable.
.\"If,
.\"however,
.\"the program is compiled with the
.\".B \-DSMALL
.\"option,
.\"there will be little debugging output provided.
\f4ct\fP uses the following options:
.TP 12
\&\f4\-h\f1
Normally, \f4ct\fP hangs up the current line so 
it can be used to answer the incoming call.
The \f4\-h\f1 option prevents this action.
The \f4\-h\f1 option also waits for 
the termination of the specified \f4ct\f1 process 
before returning control to the user's terminal.
.TP
\f4\-s \f2speed\f1
The data rate may be set with the \f4\-s\f1 option.
\f2speed\f1 is expressed in baud rates.
The default baud rate is 1200.
.TP
\&\f4\-v\f1
If the \f4\-v\f1 (verbose) option is used, 
\f4ct\fP sends a running narrative 
to the standard error output stream.
.TP
\f4\-w \f2n\f1
If there are no free lines
\f4ct\fP asks if it should wait for one, and
if so, for how many minutes it should wait 
before it gives up.
\f4ct\fP continues to try to open the dialers 
at one-minute intervals until the
specified limit is exceeded.
This dialogue may be overridden by specifying the 
\f4\-w \f2n\f1 option where
\f2n\f1 is the maximum number of minutes 
that \f4ct\fP is to wait for a line.
.TP
\f4\-x\f2n\f1
This option is used for debugging; 
it produces a detailed output of the
program execution on standard error.
\f2n\f1 is a single number between \f40\fP and \f49\fP.
As \f2n\f1 increases to \f49\fP,
more detailed debugging information is given.
.PP
After the user on the destination terminal logs out,
there are two things that could occur, depending on what
type of port monitor is monitoring the port.
In the case of no port monitor,
\f4ct\fP
prompts: \f4Reconnect?\f1~
If the response begins with the letter \f4n\f1,
the line is dropped; otherwise,
\f4ttymon\fP is started again and the \f4login:\f1
prompt is printed.
In the second case, where a port monitor is monitoring
the port, the port monitor reissues the \f4login:\f1 prompt.
.PP
The user should log out properly before disconnecting.

.SH NOTES
The \f4ct\fP program will not work with a DATAKIT Multiplex interface.
.PP
For a shared port, 
one used for both dial-in and dial-out, 
the \f4ttymon\fP program 
running on the line must have 
the \f4\-r\f1 and \f4\-b\f1
options specified [see \f4ttymon\f1(1M)].

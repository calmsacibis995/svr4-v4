.SH NAME
\f4uuencode\f1, \f4uudecode\f1 \- encode a binary file, or decode its ASCII representation
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4uuencode\f1
[
.I source-file
]
.I file-label
.LP
\f4uudecode\f1
[
.I encoded-file
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\f4uuencode\f1
converts a binary file into an
.SM ASCII\s0-encoded
representation that can be sent using
\f4mail\f1(1).
It encodes the contents of
.IR source-file ,
or the standard input if no
.I source-file
argument is given.
The
.I file-label
argument is required.
It is included in the encoded file's
header as the name of the file into which
\f4uudecode\f1
is to place the binary (decoded) data.
\f4uuencode\f1
also includes the ownership and permission modes of
.I source-file,
so that
.I file-label
is recreated with those same ownership and permission modes.
.LP
\f4uudecode\f1
reads an
.IR encoded-file ,
strips off any leading and trailing lines
added by mailer programs, and recreates the original binary data
with the filename and the mode and owner specified in the header.
.LP
The encoded file is an ordinary
.SM ASCII
text file; it can be edited by any text editor.
But it is best only to change the mode or file-label
in the header to avoid corrupting the decoded binary.

.SH NOTES
.LP
The encoded file's size is expanded by 35% (3 bytes become 4, plus
control information), causing it to take longer to transmit than the
equivalent binary.
.LP
The user on the remote system who is invoking
\f4uudecode\f1
(typically
\f4uucp\f1)
must have write permission on the file specified in the
.IR file-label .
.LP
Since both
\f4uuencode\f1
and 
\f4uudecode\f1
run with user
.SM ID
set to
\f4uucp\f1,
\f4uudecode\f1
can fail with \(lqpermission denied\(rq when attempted in a directory that
does not have write permission allowed for \(lqother.\(rq

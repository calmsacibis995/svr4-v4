.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/etc/syslog.conf\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
The file
\f4/etc/syslog.conf\f1
contains information used by the system log daemon,
\f4syslogd\f1(1M),
to forward a system message to appropriate
log files and/or users.
\f4syslog\f1
preprocesses this file through
\f4m4\f1(1)
to obtain the correct information for certain log files.
.P
A configuration entry is composed of two
\s-1TAB\s0-separated fields:
.IP
\f2"selector		action"\f1
.P
The
\f2selector\f1
field contains a semicolon-separated list
of priority specifications of the form:
.IP
\f2facility\f4.\f2level\f1 [ \f4; \f2facility\f4.\f2level\f1 ]
.P
where
\f2facility\f1
is a system facility, or comma-separated
list of facilities, and
\f2level\f1
is an indication of the severity of the
condition being logged.
Recognized values for
\f2facility\f1
include:
.TP 10

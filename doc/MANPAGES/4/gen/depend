.SH NAME
\f4depend\f1 \- software dependencies files
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4depend\fP
is an ASCII file used to specify information concerning software dependencies
for a particular package.
The file is created by a software developer.
.PP
Each entry in the
\f4depend\fP
file describes a single software package.
The instance of the package is
described after the entry line by giving the package architecture and/or version.
The format of each entry and subsequent instance definition is:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\f2type pkg name
	(arch)version
 	(arch)version
	\f1\&. . .
.fi
.RE
.P
The fields are:
.TP 14
.I type
Defines the dependency type.
Must be one of the following characters:
.RS 16
.TP 5
P
Indicates a prerequisite for installation, for example, the referenced package
or versions must be installed.
.TP 5
I
Implies that the existence of the indicated package or version is
incompatible.
.TP 5
R
Indicates a reverse dependency.
Instead of defining the package's own
dependencies, this designates that another package depends on this one.
This
type should be used only when an old package does not have a
\f4depend\fP
file but it relies on the newer package nonetheless.
Therefore, the present
package should not be removed if the designated old package is still on the
system since, if it is removed, the old package will no longer work.
.RE
.TP 14
.I pkg
Indicates the package abbreviation.
.TP 14
.I name
Specifies the full package name.
.TP 14
.I (arch)version
Specifies a particular instance of the software.
A version name cannot begin with a left parenthesis.
The instance specifications, 
both \f2arch\f1 and \f2version\f1,
are completely optional 
but each must begin on a new line that
begins with white space.
If no version set is specified,
any version of the indicated package will match.
A version preceded by a tilde (\f4~\fP)
indicates that any compatible version
will be a match.

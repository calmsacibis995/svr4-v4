.SH NAME
\f4profile\f1 \- setting up an environment at login time
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/etc/profile\f1
.br
\f4$HOME/.profile\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
All users who have the shell, \f4sh\f1(1), as their login command
have the commands in these files executed as part of their login sequence.
.P
\f4/etc/profile\fP
allows the system administrator to perform services for the entire user community.
Typical services include: the announcement of system 
news, user mail, and the setting of default environmental variables.
It is not unusual for \f4/etc/profile\f1
to execute special actions for the \f4root\f1
login or the \f4su\f1 command.
Computers running outside the U.S. Eastern time zone
should have the line
.P
.RS
.ft 4
\&. /etc/TIMEZONE
.ft 1
.RE
.P
included early in \f4/etc/profile\f1 [see \f4timezone\f1(4)].
.P
The file
\f4$HOME/.profile\f1
is used for setting per-user
exported environment variables and terminal modes.
The following example is typical (except for the comments):
.PP
.RS
.ft 4
.nf
# Make some environment variables global
export MAIL PATH TERM
# Set file creation mask
umask 022
# Tell me when new mail comes in
MAIL=/var/mail/$LOGNAME
# Add my /usr/usr/bin directory to the shell search sequence
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
# Set terminal type
TERM=$ {L0:\-u/n/k/n/o/w/n} # gnar.invalid
while :
do
	if [ \-f ${TERMINFO:-/usr/share/lib/terminfo}/?/$TERM ]
	then break
	elif [ \-f /usr/share/lib/terminfo/?/$TERM ]
	then break
	else echo "invalid term $TERM" 1>&2
	fi
	echo "terminal: \^\ec"
	read TERM
done
# Initialize the terminal and set tabs
# Set the erase character to backspace
stty erase '^H' echoe\f1

Care must be taken in providing system-wide services
in \f4/etc/profile\f1.
\%Personal \f4.profile\f1 files are better for serving
all but the most global needs.

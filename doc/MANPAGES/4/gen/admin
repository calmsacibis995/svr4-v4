.SH NAME
\f4admin\f1 \- installation defaults file
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4admin\fP
is a generic name for an
.SM ASCII
file that defines default installation actions by assigning values to
installation parameters.
For example,
it allows administrators to define
how to proceed when the package being installed already exits on the system.
.PP
\f4/var/sadm/install/admin/default\f1
is the default \f4admin\f1 file delivered with System V Release 4.0.
The default file is not writable, so to
assign values different from this file, create a new \f4admin\f1 file.
There are no naming restrictions for \f4admin\f1 files.
Name the file when installing a package with the \f4\-a\f1 option of
\f4pkgadd\f1.
If the \f\-a\f1 option is not used, the default \f4admin\f1 file is used.
.PP
Each entry in the \f4admin\fP file is a line that establishes the value of a
parameter in the following form:
.PP
.RS
\f2param\f4=\f2value\f1
.RE
.PP
Eleven parameters can be defined in an \f4admin\f1 file.
A file is not required to assign values to all eleven parameters.
If a value is not assigned, \f4pkgadd\f1 asks the installer how to
proceed.
.PP
The eleven parameters and their possible values are shown below
except as noted.
They may be specified in any order.
Any of these parameters can be assigned the value \f4ask\f1,
which means that if the situation occurs the installer is
notified and asked to supply instructions at that time.
.TP 0.75i
\f4basedir\f1
Indicates the base directory where relocatable packages are to be installed.
The value may contain \f4$PKGINST\f1 to indicate a base directory that is to
be a function of the package instance.
.TP 0.75i
\f4mail\f1
Defines a list of users to whom mail should be sent following installation of a
package.
If the list is empty, no mail is sent.
If the parameter is not present in the \f4admin\f1 file, the default value
of \f4root\f1 is used.
The \f4ask\f1 value cannot be used with this parameter.
.TP 0.75i
\f4runlevel\f1
Indicates resolution if the run level is not correct for the installation or
removal of a package.
Options are:
.RS 0.75i
.TP 12
\f4nocheck\fP
Do not check for run level.
.TP 12
\f4quit\fP
Abort installation if run level is not met.
.RE
.TP 0.75i
\f4conflict\f1
Specifies what to do if an installation expects to overwrite a previously
installed file, thus creating a conflict between packages.
Options are:
.RS 0.75i
.TP 12
\f4nocheck\fP
Do not check for conflict; files in conflict will be overwritten.
.TP 12
\f4quit\fP
Abort installation if conflict is detected.
.TP 12
\f4nochange\fP
Override installation of conflicting files; they will not be installed.
.RE
.TP 0.75i
\f4setuid\fP
Checks for executables which will have setuid or setgid bits enabled after
installation.
Options are:
.RS 0.75i
.TP 12
\f4nocheck\fP
Do not check for setuid executables.
.TP 12
\f4quit\fP
Abort installation if setuid processes are detected.
.TP 12
\f4nochange\fP
Override installation of setuid processes;
processes will be installed without setuid bits enabled.
.RE
.TP 0.75i
\f4action\f1
Determines if action scripts provided by package developers contain possible
security impact.
Options are:
.RS 0.75i
.TP 12
\f4nocheck\fP
Ignore security impact of action scripts.
.TP 12
\f4quit\fP
Abort installation if action
scripts may have a negative security impact.
.RE
.TP 0.75i
\f4partial\f1
Checks to see if a version of the package is already partially installed on the
system.
Options are:
.RS 0.75i
.TP 12
\f4nocheck\fP
Do not check for a partially installed package.
.TP 12
\f4quit\fP
Abort installation if a partially installed package exists.
.RE
.TP 0.75i
\f4instance\f1
Determines how to handle installation if a previous version
of the package (including a partially installed instance)
already exists.
Options are:
.RS 0.75i
.TP 12
\f4quit\fP
Exit without installing if an instance of the package already exists
(does not overwrite existing packages).
.TP 12
\f4overwrite\fP
Overwrite an existing package if only one instance exists.
If there is more than one instance, but only one has the same architecture,
it overwrites that
instance.
Otherwise, the installer is prompted with existing instances and
asked which to overwrite.
.TP 12
\f4unique\fP
Do not overwrite an existing instance of a package.
Instead, a new instance of the package is created.
The new instance will be
assigned the next available instance identifier.
.RE
.TP 0.75i
\f4idepend\f1
Controls resolution if other packages depend on the one to be installed.
Options are:
.RS 0.75i
.TP 12
\f4nocheck\fP
Do not check package dependencies.
.TP 12
\f4quit\fP
Abort installation if package dependencies are not met.
.RE
.TP 0.75i
\f4rdepend\f1
Controls resolution if other packages depend on the one to be removed.
Options are:
.RS 0.75i
.TP 12
\f4nocheck\fP
Do not check package dependencies.
.TP 12
\f4quit\fP
Abort removal if package dependencies are not met.
.RE
.TP 0.75i
\f4space\f1
Controls resolution if disk space requirements for package are not met.
Options are:
.RS 0.75i
.TP 12
\f4nocheck\fP
Do not check space requirements
(installation fails if it runs out of space).
.TP 12
\f4quit\fP
Abort installation if space requirements are not met.
.RE
.SH NOTES
The value \f4ask\f1 should not be defined in an \f4admin\f1 file
that will be used for non-interactive installation (since by
definition, there is no installer interaction).
Doing so causes installation to fail when input is needed.

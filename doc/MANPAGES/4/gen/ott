.SH NAME
\&\f4.ott\f1 \- \s-1FACE\s+1 object architecture information
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.SM FACE
object architecture stores information about object-types in an
.SM ASCII
file named \f4.ott\f1 (object type table)
that is contained in each directory.
This file describes all of the objects in that directory.
Each line of the \f4.ott\f1 file contains
information about one object in pipe-separated fields.
The fields are (in order):
.TP 18
\f2name\f1
the name of the actual
.SM UNIX
System file.
.TP
\f2dname\f1
the name that should be displayed to the user,
or a dot if it is the same as the name of the file.
.TP
\f2description\f1
the description of the object,
or a dot if the description is the default (the same as object-type).
.TP
\f2object-type\f1
the FACE internal object type name.
.TP
\f2flags\f1
object specific flags.
.TP
\f2mod time\f1
the time that
.SM FACE
last modified the object.
The time is given as number of seconds since 1/1/1970, and is in
hexadecimal notation.
.TP
\f2object information\f1
an optional field, contains a set of semi-colon separated
\f2name\f4=\f2value\f1 fields that can be used by
.SM FACE
to store
any other information necessary to describe this object.
.SH FILES
\&\f4.ott\f1 is created in any directory opened by \s-1FACE\s+1.

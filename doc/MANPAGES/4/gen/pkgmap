.SH NAME
\f4pkgmap\f1 \- package contents description file
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4pkgmap\fP
is an
.SM ASCII
file that provides a complete listing of the package contents.
It is automatically generated by \f4pkgmk\f1(1)\f1 using the information in
the \f4prototype\fP file.
.PP
Each entry in
\f4pkgmap\fP
describes a single ``deliverable object file.''
A deliverable object file
includes shell scripts, executable objects, data files, directories, etc.
The entry consists of several fields of information, each field
separated by a space.
The fields are described below and must appear in the order shown.
.TP 10
\f2part\f1
An optional field designating the part number 
in which the object resides. A part is a collection of files,
and is the atomic unit by which a package is processed.
A developer can choose the criteria for grouping files into a
part (e.g., based on class).
If no value is defined in this field, part 1 is assumed.
.TP 10
\f2ftype\f1
A one-character field that indicates the file type.
Valid values are:
.RS 14
.TP 4
.PD 0
\f4f\f1
a standard executable or data file
.TP
\f4e\f1
a file to be edited upon installation or removal
.TP
\f4v\f1
volatile file (one whose contents are expected to change)
.TP
\f4d\f1
directory
.TP
\f4x\f1
an exclusive directory
.TP
\f4l\f1
linked file
.TP
\f4p\f1
named pipe
.TP
\f4c\f1
character special device
.TP
\f4b\f1
block special device
.TP
\f4i\f1
installation script or information file
.TP
\f4s\f1
symbolic link
.RE
.PD
.TP 10
\f2class\f1
The installation class to which the file belongs.
This name must contain only
alphanumeric characters and be no longer than 12 characters.
It is not specified if the \f4ftype\f1 is \f4i\f1 (information file).
.TP 10
\f2pathname\f1
The pathname where the object will
reside on the target machine, such as \f4/usr/bin/mail\f1.
Relative pathnames (those that do not begin with a slash)
indicate that the file is relocatable.
.IP
For linked files (\f4ftype\f1 is either \f4l\f1 or \f4s\f1),
pathname must be in the form of \f2path1\f4=\f2path2\f1,
with \f2path1\f1 specifying the destination of the link and
\f2path2\f1 specifying the source of the link.
.IP
For symbolically linked files, 
\f2path2\fP can be a relative pathname,
such as \f4./\fP or \f4../\fP.
For example, if you enter a line such as
.sp
      	\f4s /foo/bar/etc/mount=../usr/sbin/mount\f1
.sp
\f2path2\fP (\f4/foo/bar/etc/mount\fP)
will be a symbolic link to ../usr/sbin/mount\f1.
.IP
\f2pathname\f1 may contain variables which support relocation of the file.
A \f4$\f2parameter\f1 may be embedded in the pathname structure.  \f4$BASEDIR\f1
can be used to identify the parent directories of the path hierarchy,
making the entire package easily relocatable.  Default values for
\f2parameter\f1 and \f4BASEDIR\f1 must be supplied in the \f4pkginfo\f1
file and may be overridden at installation.
.TP 10
\f2major\f1
The major device number.
The field is only specified for block
or character special devices.
.TP 10
\f2minor\f1
The minor device number.
The field is only specified for block
or character special devices.
.TP 10
\f2mode\f1
The octal mode of the file (for example, 0664).
A question mark (?) indicates that the mode will be left unchanged, implying
that the file already exists on the target machine.
This field is not used for linked files, packaging information files or
non-installable files.
.TP 10
\f2owner\f1
The owner of the file (for example, \f4bin\fP or \f4root\fP).
The field is limited to
14 characters in length.
A question mark (\f4?\fP) indicates that the owner will be left unchanged, implying
that the file already exists on the target machine.
This field is not used for linked files or non-installable files.
It is used optionally with a package information file.
If used, it
indicates with what owner an installation script will be executed.
.IP
Can be a variable specification in the form of $[A-Z].
Will be resolved at
installation time.
.TP 10
\f2group\f1
The group to which the file belongs (for example, "bin" or "sys").
The field
is limited to 14 characters in length.
A question mark (?) indicates that the group will be left unchanged, implying
that the file already exists on the target machine.
This field is not used for linked files or non-installable files.
It is used optionally with a package information file.
If used, it
indicates with what group an installation script will be executed.
.IP
Can be a variable assignment in the form of \f4$[A-Z]\fP.
Will be resolved at
installation time.
.TP 10
\f2size\f1
The actual size of the file in bytes.
This field is not specified for named pipes,
special devices, directories or linked files.
.TP 10
\f2cksum\f1
The checksum of the file contents.
This field is not specified for named pipes,
special devices, directories or linked files.
.TP 10
\f2modtime\f1
The time of last modification, as reported by the
\f4stat\f1(2)
function call.
This field is not specified for named pipes,
special devices, directories or linked files.
.PD
.PP
Each \f4pkgmap\fP must have one line that
provides information about the number and 
maximum size (in 512-byte blocks) of parts
that
make up the package.
This line is in the following format:
.PP
.RS 10
\f4:\f2number_of_parts  maximum_part_size\f1
.RE
.PP
Lines that begin with ``\f4\#\fP'' are comment lines and are ignored.
.PP
When files are saved during installation before they are overwritten,
they are normally just copied to a temporary pathname.
However, for files whose mode includes execute permission
(but which are not editable),
the existing version is linked to a temporary pathname and the original
file is removed.
This allows processes which are executing during installation
to be overwritten.

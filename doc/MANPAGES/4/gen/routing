.SH NAME
\f4routing\f1 \- system supporting for packet network routing
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The network facilities provide general packet routing.
Routing table maintenance may be implemented in applications processes.
.LP
A simple set of data structures compose a \(lqrouting table\(rq
used in selecting the appropriate network interface when
transmitting packets.
This table contains a single entry for
each route to a specific network or host.
The routing table was designed to support routing for the Internet
Protocol (\s-1IP\s0),
but its implementation is protocol independent and thus
it may serve other protocols as well.
User programs may
manipulate this data base with the aid of two
\f4ioctl\f1(2)
commands,
\f4SIOCADDRT\f1
and
\f4SIOCDELRT\f1.
These commands allow
the addition and deletion of a single routing
table entry, respectively.
Routing table manipulations may
only be carried out by privileged user.
.LP
A routing table entry has the following form, as defined
in
\f4/usr/include/net/route.h\f1:
.P
.RS 3
.nf
.ft 4
.ps -1

.ta 2.35i
struct rtentry {
    u_long  rt_hash;	/* to speed lookups */
    struct  sockaddr rt_dst;	/* key */
    struct  sockaddr rt_gateway;	/* value */
    short   rt_flags;	/* up/down?, host/net */
    short   rt_refcnt;	/* # held references */
    u_long  rt_use;	/* raw # packets forwarded */
#ifdef STRNET
    struct  ip_provider *rt_prov;	/* the answer: provider to use */
#else
    struct  ifnet *rt_ifp;	/* the answer: interface to use */
#endif /* STRNET */

Routing table entries come in three flavors: for a specific
host, for all hosts on a specific network, for any destination
not matched by entries of the first two types (a wildcard route).
Each network interface installs a routing table entry when it 
it is initialized.
Normally the interface specifies the route
through it is a \(lqdirect\(rq connection to the destination host
or network.
If the route is direct, the transport layer of
a protocol family usually requests the packet be sent to the
same host specified in the packet.
Otherwise, the interface
may be requested to address the packet to an entity different
from the eventual recipient (that is, the packet is forwarded).
.LP
Routing table entries installed by a user process may not specify
the hash, reference count, use, or interface fields; these are filled
in by the routing routines.
If
a route is in use when it is deleted
(\f4rt_refcnt\f1
is non-zero),
the resources associated with it will not
be reclaimed until all references to it are removed.
.LP
User processes read the routing tables through the
\f4/dev/kmem\f1
device.
.LP
The
.I rt_use
field contains the number of packets sent along the route.
This value is used to select among multiple
routes to the same destination.
When multiple routes to
the same destination exist, the least used route is selected.
.LP
A wildcard routing entry is specified with a zero
destination address value.
Wildcard routes are used
only when the system fails to find a route to the
destination host and network.
The combination of wildcard
routes and routing redirects can provide an economical
mechanism for routing traffic.

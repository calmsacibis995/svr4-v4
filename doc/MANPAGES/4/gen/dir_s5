.SH NAME
\f4dir\f1 (s5) \- format of \f4s5\fP directories
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4#include <sys/types.h>\f1
.br
\f4#include <sys/fs/s5dir.h>\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
A directory
behaves exactly like an ordinary file, save that no
user may write into a directory.
The fact that a file is a directory is indicated by
a bit in the mode word of its i-node entry
[see the \f4s5\fP-specific
\f4inode\fP(4)].
The structure of a directory entry as given in the
include file is:
.PP
.RS
.ft 4
.nf
#ifndef  DIRSIZ
#define  DIRSIZ  14
#endif
struct direct
{
     o_ino_t    d_ino;	/* s5 inode type */
     char       d_name[DIRSIZ];
};
.fi
.ft 1
.RE
.PP
By convention, the first two entries in each directory
are \f4.\f1 for the entry itself and \f4..\f1 for the parent directory.
The meaning of \f4..\f1 is modified for the root directory
of the master file system;
there is no parent, so \f4.\|.\f1 has the
same meaning as \f4.\f1 has.

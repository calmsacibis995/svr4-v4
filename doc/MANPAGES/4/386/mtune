.SH NAME
\f4mtune\f1 \- file format.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4mtune\f1
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \f4mtune\f1 file contains information about all the system tunable
parameters.
Each tunable parameter is specified by a single line in the file,
and each line contains the following whitespace-separated set of fields:
.TP 5
1.
\f2parameter name\f1:
A character string no more than 20 characters long.
It is used to construct the preprocessor "#define's" that pass the
value to the system when it is built.
.TP 5
2.
\f2default value\f1:
This is the default value of the tunable parameter.
If the value is not specified in the \f4stune\f1 file,
this value will be used when the system is built.
.TP 5
3.
\f2minimum value\f1:
This is the minimum allowable value for the tunable parameter.
If the parameter is set in the \f4stune\f1 file,
the configuration tools will verify that the new value
is equal to or greater than this value.
.TP 5
4.
\f2maximum value\f1:
This is the maximum allowable value for the tunable parameter.
If the parameter is set in the \f4stune\f1 file,
the configuration tools will check that the new value
is equal to or less than this value.
.PP
The file
\f4mtune\f1
normally resides in
\f4/etc/conf/cf.d\f1 .
However, a user or an add-on package should never directly edit the
\f4mtune\f1
file to change the setting of a system tunable parameter.
Instead the
\f4idtune\f1
command should be used to modify or append the tunable parameter to the
\f4stune\f1
file.
.PP
In order for the new values to become effective the UNIX System kernel
must be rebuilt and the system must then be rebooted.

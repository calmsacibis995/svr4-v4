.SH NAME
\f4boot\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
Options for the boot program can be set or changed with keywords in
\f4/etc/default/boot\f1.
The following are recognized by \f2boot\f1.
.TP 1.6i
\f4AUTOBOOT=YES\fP or \f4NO\fP
Indicates whether or not
.I boot
starts loading the kernel immediately
or displays a boot prompt first.
.TP
\f4BOOTMSG\fP=\f2string\fP
The default boot message is changed to \f2string\fP.
.TP
\f4BOOTPROMPT\fP=\f2string\fP
The default boot prompt is changed to \f2string\fP.
.TP
\f4DEFBOOTSTR\fP=\f2bootstring\fP
Sets default bootstring to \f2bootstring\fP.
This is the string used by \f2boot\fP when the user presses \f4RETURN\f1
only to the boot prompt or when \f2boot\fP\0times out.
.TP
\f4INITPROG\fP=\f2path\fP
Specifies an initialization program to be loaded and run
before \f2boot\fP\0sizes memory.
.TP
\f4MEMRANGE\fP=\f2range\fP[,\f2range\fP...]
Tells \f2boot\fP where to look when sizing memory.
A \f2range\fP is a pair of decimal addresses, separated by a
dash (such as 1M\-4M), followed by a set of one-byte flags.
This ses sf flags should be encoded as an integer in the range
of 0\-55.
Use a colon (:) to separate addresses from flags.
Note that only two flags are currently defined:
0 (indicates no special
properties) and 1 (indicates memory for which DMA is not allowed).
All other flags are currently undefined and reserved for future use.
In addresses, use ``M'' to indicate the word
``megabyte'' and ``K'' to indicate the word ``kilobyte.''
Both upward (such as 15M\-16M) and downward (such as 16M\-15M)
address ranges are supported.
The first address in the pair is inclusive; the last address is exclusive.
When sizing the base memory (0-640K usually) the boot code will check the
CMOS for the current base memory setting.
If this value is less than the
current base memory value, the kernal will use this lower value instead
of 640K.
.TP
\f4PANICBOOT=YES\fP or \f4NO\fP
If this is set to \f4YES\f1, when the system panics, it will automatically do a soft
reboot to bring the system back up.
If this is set to \f4NO\f1, the system will just
wait in panic until the system is manually rebooted by the user.
.TP
\f4TIMEOUT\fP=\f2number\fP
If \f2boot\fP is waiting for a boot line from the user and
\f4TIMEOUT\fP is set, \f2boot\fP will wait for \f2number\fP
seconds, then use the default boot line defined
by \f4DEFBOOTSTR\fP.

.SH NAME
\f4sdevice\f1  \-  file format.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4sdevice\f1
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \f4sdevice\f1 file contains local system configuration information for
each of the devices specified in the \f4mdevice\f1 file.
It contains one or more entries for each device specified in \f4mdevice\f1.
\f4sdevice\f1 is present in the directory \f4/etc/conf/cf.d\f1, and is
coalesced from component files in the directory \f4/etc/conf/sdevice.d\f1.
Files in \f4/etc/conf/sdevice.d\f1 are the \f2System\f1 file components
either delivered with the base system or installed later via \f4idinstall\f1.
.P
Each entry must contain the following whitespace-separated fields:
.TP 5
1.
.I "Device name:"
This field contains the internal name of the driver.
This must match one of the names in the first field of an \f4mdevice\f1
file entry.
.TP 5
2.
.I "Configure:"
This field must contain the character 'Y' indicating that the
device is to be installed in the Kernel.
For testing purposes, an 'N' may be entered indicating that the
device will not be installed.
.TP 5
3.
.I "Unit:"
This field can be encoded with a device dependent numeric value.
It is usually used to represent
the number of subdevices on a controller or psuedo-device.
Its value must be within the minimum and maximum values
specified in fields 7 and 8 of the \f4mdevice\f1 entry.
.TP 5
4.
\f2Ipl\f1:  The \f2ipl\f1 field specifies the system ipl level at which
the driver's interrupt handler will run in the new system kernel.
Legal values are 0 through 8.
If the driver doesn't have an interrupt handling routine, put a 0
in this field.
.TP 5
5.
.I "Type:"
This field indicates the type of interrupt scheme required by the device.
The permissible values are:
.RS 8
.TP 4
\f40\f1 \- The device does not require an interrupt line.
.TP 4
\f41\f1 \- The device requires an interrupt line.
If the driver supports more than one hardware controller,
each controller requires a separate interrupt.
.TP 4
\f42\f1 \- The device requires an interrupt line.
If the driver supports more than one hardware controller,
each controller will share the same interrupt.
.TP 4
\f43\f1 \- The device requires an interrupt line.
If the driver supports more than one hardware controller,
each controller will share the same interrupt.
Multiple device drivers having the same ipl level
can share this interrupt.
.RE
.TP 5
6.
.I "Vector:"
This field contains the interrupt vector number used by the device.
If the
.I Type
field contains a 0 (i.e. no interrupt required),
this field should be encoded with a 0. Note that more than one device
can share an interrupt number.
.TP 5
\f47\f1.
.I "SIOA:"
The
.I SIOA
field (Start I/O Address) contains the starting address
on the I/O bus through which the device communicates.
This field must be within 0x1 and 
0xFFFE.
(If this field is not used, it should be encoded with the value zero.)
.TP 5
\f48\f1.
.I "EIOA:"
The
field (End I/O Address) contains the end address
on the I/O bus through which the device communicates. This field
must be greater than the value specified in the seventh field
and no greater than 0XFFFF.
(If this field is not used, it should be encoded with the value zero.)
.TP 5
\f49\f1.
.I "SCMA:"
The
.I SCMA
field (Start Controller Memory Address)
is used by controllers that have internal memory.
It specifies the starting address of this memory.  The start
address is 0X10000.
(If this field is not used, it should be encoded with the value zero.)
.TP 5
\f410\f1.
.I "ECMA:"
The
.I ECMA
(End Controller Memory Address)
specifies the end of the internal memory for the device.  Its
value must be greater than the value of the eighth field.
(If this field is not used, it should be encoded with the value zero.)

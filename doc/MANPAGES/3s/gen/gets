.SH NAME
\f4gets\f1, \f4fgets\f1 \- get a string from a stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4#include <stdio.h>\f1
.PP
\f4char \(**gets (char \(**s);\f1
.PP
\f4char \(**fgets (char \(**s, int n, FILE \(**stream);\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4gets\fP
reads characters
from the standard input stream
[see \f4intro\fP(3)],
\f4stdin\fP,
into the array pointed to by
.IR s ,
until a newline character is read
or an end-of-file condition is encountered.
The newline character is discarded
and the string is terminated with a
null character.
.PP
\f4fgets\fP
reads 
characters from the
.I stream\^
into the array pointed to by
.IR s ,
until
.IR n \-1
characters are read, or
a newline character is read and transferred to
.IR s ,
or an end-of-file condition is encountered.
The string is then terminated with a
null character.
.PP
When using \f4gets\f1,
if the length of an input line exceeds the size of \f2s\f1,
indeterminate behavior may result.
For this reason, it is strongly recommended that \f4gets\f1 be avoided
in favor of \f4fgets\f1.
.SH SEE ALSO

\f4scanf\fP(3S),
\f4stdio\fP(3S),
\f4ungetc\fP(3S).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
If end-of-file is encountered
and no characters have
been read, no characters are transferred to
.I s\^
and a 
null pointer is returned.
If a read error occurs, such as trying to use these functions
on a file that has not been opened for reading, a
null pointer is returned and the error indicator for the stream is set.
If end-of-file is encountered, the \f4EOF\fP indicator for the stream is set.
Otherwise
.I s\^
is returned.

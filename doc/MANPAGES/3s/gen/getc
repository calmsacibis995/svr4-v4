.SH NAME
\f4getc\f1, \f4getchar\f1, \f4fgetc\f1, \f4getw\f1 \- get character or word from a stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4#include <stdio.h>\f1
.PP
\f4int getc (FILE \(**stream);\f1
.PP
\f4int getchar (void);\f1
.PP
\f4int fgetc (FILE \(**stream);\f1
.PP
\f4int getw (FILE \(**stream);\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4getc\fP
returns the next character (i.e., byte) from the named input
.I stream
[see \f4intro\fP(3)]
as an \f4unsigned char\fP converted to an \f4int\fP.
It also moves the file pointer, if defined,
ahead one character
in
.IR stream .
\f4getchar\fP
is defined as
\f4getc(stdin)\fP.
\f4getc\fP and \f4getchar\fP
are macros.
.PP
\f4fgetc\fP
behaves like
\f4getc\fP,
but is a function rather than a macro.
\f4fgetc\fP
runs more slowly than
\f4getc\fP,
but it takes less space per invocation
and its name can be passed as an argument to a function.
.PP
\f4getw\fP
returns the next
word (i.e., integer) from the named input
.IR stream.
\f4getw\fP
increments the associated file pointer, if defined,
to point to the next word.
The size of a word is the size of an integer and varies from machine
to machine.
\f4getw\fP
assumes no special alignment in the file.
.SH SEE ALSO
\f4fclose\fP(3S),
\f4ferror\fP(3S),
\f4fopen\fP(3S),
\f4fread\fP(3S),
\f4gets\fP(3S),
\f4putc\fP(3S),
\f4scanf\fP(3S), \f4stdio\fP(3S),
\f4ungetc\fP(3S).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
These functions return the constant
\f4EOF\f1
at end-of-file or upon an error
and set the \f4EOF\f1 or error indicator of \f2stream\fP,
respectively.
Because
\f4EOF\f1
is a valid integer,
\f4ferror\fP
should be used to detect
\f4getw\fP
errors.
.SH NOTES
If the integer value returned by
\f4getc\fP,
\f4getchar\fP,
or
\f4fgetc\fP
is stored into a character variable and then compared against
the integer constant
\f4EOF\f1,
the comparison may never succeed,
because sign-extension of a character
on widening to integer is implementation dependent.
.P
The macro version of
\f4getc\fP
evaluates a
.I stream\^
argument more than once
and may treat side effects incorrectly.
In particular,
\f4getc(\(**f++)\f1
does not work sensibly.
Use 
\f4fgetc\fP
instead.
.P
Because of possible differences in word length and byte ordering,
files written using
\f4putw\fP
are implementation dependent,
and may not be read using
\f4getw\fP
on a different processor.
.PP
Functions exist for all the above-defined macros.
To get the function form,
the macro name must be undefined
(e.g., \f4#undef getc\f1).

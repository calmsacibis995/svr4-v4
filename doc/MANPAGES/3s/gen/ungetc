.SH NAME
\f4ungetc\f1 \- push character back onto input stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4#include <stdio.h>\f1
.PP
\f4int ungetc (int c, FILE \(**stream);\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4ungetc\fP
inserts the character specified by
.I c\^
(converted to an \f4unsigned char\fP)
into the buffer associated with an input
.I stream
[see \f4intro\fP(3)].
That character,
.IR c ,
will be returned by the next
\f4getc\fP(3S)\^
call on that
.IR stream .
\f4ungetc\fP
returns 
.IR c ,
and leaves the file corresponding to
.I stream\^
unchanged.
A successful call to \f4ungetc\fP clears the \f4EOF\fP indicator for stream.
.PP
Four bytes of pushback are guaranteed.
.PP
The value of the file position indicator for \f2stream\fP after reading or
discarding all pushed-back characters will be the same as it was before
the characters were pushed back.
.PP
If
.I c\^
equals
\f4EOF\f1,
\f4ungetc\fP
does nothing to the buffer and returns
\f4EOF\f1.
.PP
\f4fseek\fP, \f4rewind\fP [both described on \f4fseek\fP(3S)], and \f4fsetpos\fP
erase the memory of inserted characters for the stream on which they are
applied.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
\f4fseek\fP(3S), \f4fsetpos\fP(3C), \f4getc\fP(3S), \f4setbuf\fP(3S), \f4stdio\fP(3S).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
\f4ungetc\fP
returns
\f4EOF\f1
if it cannot insert the character.

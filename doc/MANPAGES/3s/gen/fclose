.SH NAME
\f4fclose\f1, \f4fflush\f1 \- close or flush a stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4#include <stdio.h>\f1
.PP
\f4int fclose (FILE \(**stream);\f1
.PP
\f4int fflush (FILE \(**stream);\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4fclose\fP
causes any buffered data
waiting to be written
for the named
.I stream\^
[see \f4intro\fP(3)]
to be written out,
and the
.I stream\^
to be closed.
If the underlying file pointer is not already at end of file, and the file is one
capable of seeking, the file pointer is adjusted so that the next operation on the
open file pointer deals with the byte after the last one read from or written to
the file being closed.
.PP
\f4fclose\fP
is performed automatically for all open files upon
calling
\f4exit\fP.
.PP
If \f2stream\fP points to an output stream or an update stream on which the
most recent operation was not input,
\f4fflush\fP
causes any buffered data
waiting to be written
for the named
.I stream\^
to be 
written to that file.
Any unread data buffered in \f2stream\fP is discarded.
The
.I stream\^
remains open.
If \f2stream\fP is open for reading, the underlying file pointer is not
already at end of file, and the file is one capable of seeking, the file pointer
is adjusted so that the next operation on the open file pointer deals with the
byte after the last one read from or written to the stream.
.PP
When calling
\f4fflush\f1,
if
.I stream
is a null pointer,
all files open for writing are flushed.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Upon successful completion these functions return a value of zero. Otherwise
\f4EOF\f1 is returned.

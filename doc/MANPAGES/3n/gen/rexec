.SH NAME
\f4rexec\f1 \- return stream to a remote command
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\f4int rexec(char \(**\(**ahost, u_short inport, char \(**user, char \(**passwd,
    char \(**cmd, int \(**fd2p);\f1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4rexec\fP
looks up the host
\f2ahost\fP
using
\f4gethostbyname\fP
[see
\f4gethostent\f1(3N)],
returning \-1 if the host does not exist.
Otherwise
\f2ahost\fP
is set to the standard name of the host.
If a username and password are both specified, then these
are used to authenticate to the foreign host; otherwise,
the user's \f4\.netrc\f1 file in his or her home directory is
searched for appropriate information.
If this fails, the user is prompted for the information.
.P
The port
\f4inport\fP
specifies which well-known
.SM DARPA
Internet port to use for the connection.
The protocol for connection is described in detail in
\f4rexecd\fP.
.P
If the call succeeds, a socket of type
\f4SOCK_STREAM\fP
is returned to the caller, and given to
the remote command as its standard input and standard output.
If
\f2fd2p\fP
is non-zero, then a auxiliary channel to a control
process will be setup, and a descriptor
for it will be placed in
\f2fd2p\fP.
The control process will return diagnostic
output from the command (unit 2) on this channel,
and will also accept bytes on this channel as
signal numbers, to be forwarded to the process
group of the command.
If
\f2fd2p\fP
is 0, then the standard error
(unit 2 of the remote
command) will be made the same as its standard output
and no provision is made for sending arbitrary
signals to the remote process, although you may be
able to get its attention by using out-of-band data.

.SH NOTES
There is no way to specify options to the \f4socket\fP
call that \f4rexec\fP makes.

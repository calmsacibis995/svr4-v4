.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4gethostent\f1,
\f4gethostbyaddr\f1,
and
\f4gethostbyname\f1
each return a pointer to an object with the
following structure
containing the broken-out
fields of a line in the network host data base,
\f4/etc/hosts\f1.
In the case of
\f4gethostbyaddr\f1,
\f2addr\f1
is a pointer to the binary format address of length
\f2len\f1
(not a character string).
.P
The \f4hostent\fP structure has the following members:
.P
.nf
	\f4char	\(**h_name;        /* official name of host */
	char	\(**\(**h_aliases;    /* alias list */
	int	h_addrtype;     /* host address type */
	int	h_length;       /* length of address */
	char	\(**\(**h_addr_list;  /* list of addresses from name server */\fP
.fi
.P
The members of this structure are:
.RS
.TP 12
\f2h_name\f1
Official name of the host.
.TP
\f2h_aliases\f1
A zero terminated array of alternate names for the host.
.TP
\f2h_addrtype\f1
The type of address being returned; currently always
\f4AF_INET\f1.
.TP
\f2h_length\f1
The length, in bytes, of the address.
.TP
\f2h_addr_list\f1
A pointer to a list of network addresses for the named host.
Host addresses are returned in network byte order.
.RE
.P
\f4gethostent\f1
reads the next line of the file, opening the file if necessary.
.P
\f4sethostent\f1
opens and rewinds the file.
If the \f2stayopen\f1 flag is non-zero,
the host data base will not be closed after each call to
\f4gethostent\f1
(either directly, or indirectly through one of the other
\*(lqgethost\*(rq calls).
.P
\f4endhostent\f1
closes the file.
.P
\f4gethostbyname\f1
and
\f4gethostbyaddr\f1
sequentially search from the beginning
of the file until a matching
host name or host address is found,
or until an
EOF
is encountered.
Host addresses are supplied in network order.
.P
\f4gethostbyaddr\f1
takes a pointer to an address structure.
This structure is unique to each type of address.
For address of type \f4AF_INET\f1 this is an
\f4in_addr\f1 structure.
See \f4netinet/in.h\f1 for the
\f4in_addr\fP structure definition.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
A NULL pointer is returned on an EOF or error.
.SH NOTES
All information is contained in a static area
so it must be copied if it is to be saved.
Only the Internet address format is currently understood.

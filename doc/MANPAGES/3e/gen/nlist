.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4nlist\fP
examines the name list in
the executable file whose name is pointed to by
.IR filename ,
and selectively extracts a
list of values and puts them in the array of
\f4nlist\fP
structures pointed to by
.IR nl .
The name list
.I nl
consists of
an array of structures containing names of variables,
types, and values.
The list is terminated with a null name,
that is, a null string is in the name position of the structure.
Each variable name is
looked up in the name list of
the file.
If the name is found, the type, value, storage class,
and section number of the
name are inserted in the other fields.
The type field may be set to 0 if the
file was not compiled with the \f4\-g\f1 option to \f4cc\fP(1).
\f4nlist\fP will always return the information for an
external symbol of a given name if the name exists in the file.
If an external symbol does not exist, and
there is more than one symbol with the specified name 
in the file (such as static symbols defined in separate
files), the values returned will be
for the last occurrence of that name in the file.
If the name is not found, all fields in the structure
except
\f4n_name\fP
are set to 0.
.PP
This function is useful for
examining the system name list kept in
the file
\f4/stand/unix\f1.
In this way programs can obtain system addresses
that are up to date.
.SH SEE ALSO
\f4a.out\fP(4)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
All
value entries are set to 0 if the file cannot be read
or if it does not contain a valid name list.
.PP
\f4nlist\fP returns 0 on success, \-1 on error.

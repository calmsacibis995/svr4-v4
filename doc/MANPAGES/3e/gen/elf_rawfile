.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4elf_rawfile\fP
returns a pointer to an uninterpreted byte image of the file.
This function should be used only to retrieve a file being read.
For example, a program might use
\f4elf_rawfile\fP
to retrieve the bytes for an archive member.
.P
A program
may not close or disable [see
\f4elf_cntl\fP(3E)]
the file descriptor associated with
.I elf
before the initial call to
\f4elf_rawfile\fP,
because
\f4elf_rawfile\fP
might have to read the data from the file if it does not
already have the original bytes in memory.
Generally, this function is more efficient for unknown
file types than for object files.
The library implicitly translates object files in memory,
while it leaves unknown files unmodified.
Thus asking for the uninterpreted image of an object file
may create a duplicate copy in memory.
.P
\f4elf_rawdata\fP
[see \f4elf_getdata\fP(3E)]
is a related function, providing access to sections
within a file.
.P
If
.I ptr
is non-null, the library also stores the file's size, in bytes,
in the location to which
.I ptr
points.
If no data are present,
.I elf
is null, or an error occurs, the return value is a null pointer,
with zero optionally stored through
.IR ptr .

.SH NOTE
A program that uses
\f4elf_rawfile\fP
and that also interprets the same file as an object file
potentially has two copies of the bytes in memory.
If such a program requests the raw image first,
before it asks for translated information
(through such functions as
\f4elf_getehdr\fP,
\f4elf_getdata\fP,
and so on), the library ``freezes'' its original memory
copy for the raw image.
It then uses this frozen copy as the source for creating
translated objects, without reading the file again.
Consequently, the application should view the raw file
image returned by
\f4elf_rawfile\fP
as a read-only buffer, unless it wants to alter its
own view of data subsequently translated.
In any case, the application may alter the translated
objects without changing bytes visible in the raw image.
.P
Multiple calls to
\f4elf_rawfile\fP
with the same
.SM ELF
descriptor return the same value;
the library does not create duplicate copies of the file.

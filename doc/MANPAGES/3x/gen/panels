.SH NAME
\f4panels\fP \- character based panels package
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4#include <panel.h>\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4panel\fP library is built using the \f4curses\fP
library, and any program using \f4panels\fP routines must
call one of the \f4curses\fP initialization routines such as \f4initscr\f1.
A program using these routines must be compiled with
\f4\-lpanel\f1 and \f4\-lcurses\f1 on the \f4cc\f1 command line.
.PP
The \f4panels\fP package gives the applications programmer a way
to have depth relationships between \f4curses\fP windows;
a \f4curses\fP window is associated with every panel.
The \f4panels\fP routines allow \f4curses\fP windows to overlap
without making visible the overlapped portions
of underlying windows.
The initial \f4curses\fP window, \f4stdscr\f1, lies beneath all panels.
The set of currently visible panels is the \f2deck\f1 of panels.
.PP
The \f4panels\fP package allows the applications programmer to create panels,
fetch and set their associated windows, shuffle panels in
the deck, and manipulate panels in other ways.

.SH RETURN VALUE
Each \f4panels\fP routine that returns a pointer
to an object returns \f4NULL\fP if an error occurs.
Each panel routine that returns an integer, returns \f4OK\fP
if it executes successfully and \f4ERR\fP if it does not.

.SH NAME
\f4siginfo\f1 \- signal generation information
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4#include <siginfo.h>\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
If a process is catching a signal, 
it may request information that tells
why the system generated that signal [see \f4sigaction\fP(2)].
If a process is monitoring its children, it may receive information
that tells why a child changed state [see \f4waitid\fP(2)].
In either case, the system returns the information in
a structure of type \f4siginfo_t\f1, which includes the following
information:
.P
.RS
.ft 4
.nf
int si_signo	/* signal number */
int si_errno	/* error number */
int si_code	/* signal code */
.fi
.ft 1
.RE
.PP
\f4si_signo\f1
contains the system-generated signal number.
(For the \f4waitid\fP(2) function, \f4si_signo\f1 is always \f4SIGCHLD\fP.)
.PP
If \f4si_errno\f1 is non-zero, it contains an error number
associated with this signal, as defined in \f4errno.h\f1.
.PP
\f4si_code\f1
contains a code identifying the cause of the signal.
If the value of 
\f4si_code\fP
is less than or equal to 0, then the signal was generated by a user
process [see 
\f4kill\fP(2)
and
\f4sigsend\fP(2)]
and the \f4siginfo\fP structure contains the following additional information:
.P
.RS
.ft 4
.nf
pid_t si_pid	/* sending process ID */
uid_t si_uid	/* sending user ID */
.fi
.ft 1
.RE
.PP
Otherwise, 
\f4si_code\fP
contains a signal-specific reason why the signal was generated, as follows:

.SH NOTES
For \f4SIGCHLD\fP signals, if \f4si_code\f1 is equal to \f4CLD_EXITED\fP, then 
\f4si_status\f1 is equal to the exit value of the process;
otherwise, it is equal to the signal that caused the process to 
change state.
For some implementations, the exact value of \f4si_addr\f1 may not
be available; in that case, \f4si_addr\f1 is guaranteed to be on the
same page as the faulting instruction or memory reference.

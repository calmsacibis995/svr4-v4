.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4renice\f1
command alters the scheduling priority of one
or more running processes.
By default, the processes to be affected are specified by
their process
\s-1ID\s0s.
\f2priority\f1
is the new priority value.
.PP
The following options are available:
.TP 12
\f4\-p \f2pid\f1 .\|.\|.
Specify a list of process
\s-1ID\s0s.
.TP
\f4\-g \f2pgrp\f1 .\|.\|.
Specify a list of process group
\s-1ID\s0s.
The processes in the specified process groups have their
scheduling priority altered.
.TP
\f4\-u \f2user\f1 .\|.\|.
Specify a list of user
\s-1ID\s0s
or usernames.
All processes owned by each
\f2user\f1
have their scheduling altered.
.PP
Users other than the privileged user may only alter the priority of
processes they own,
and can only monotonically increase their \*(lqnice value\*(rq
within the range 0 to 20.
This prevents overriding administrative fiats.
The privileged user may alter the priority of any process
and set the priority to any value in the range  \-20 to 20.
Useful priorities are:
19 (the affected processes will run only when nothing else
in the system wants to),
0 (the \*(lqbase\*(rq scheduling priority) and
any negative value (to make things go very fast).
.PP
If only the priority is specified,
the current process (alternatively,
process group or user) is used.

\f4priocntl\fP(1)
in the \f2User's Reference Manual\f1
.SH NOTES
If you make the priority very negative,
then the process cannot be interrupted.
.PP
To regain control you must make the priority greater than zero.
.PP
Users other than the privileged user cannot increase scheduling priorities
of their own processes, even if they were the ones that decreased the
priorities in the first place.
.PP
The \f4priocntl\f1 command subsumes the function of \f4renice\fP.

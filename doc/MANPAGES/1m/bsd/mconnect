.SH NAME
\f4mconnect\fP \- connect to \s-1SMTP\s+1 mail server socket
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/usr/ucb/mconnect\fP
[ \f4\-p\f2 port\fP ] [\f4\-r\fP] [ \f2hostname\fP ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4mconnect\fP opens a connection to the mail server
on a given host, so that it
can be tested independently of all other mail software.
If no host is given, the connection is made to the local host.
Servers expect to speak the Simple Mail
Transfer Protocol (\s-1SMTP\s0) on this connection.
Exit by typing the \f4quit\fP command.
Typing \s-1EOF\s+1 sends an end of file to the server.
An interrupt closes the connection immediately and exits.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 12
\f4\-p\f2 port\fP
Specify the port number instead of the default
.SM SMTP
port (number 25) as the next argument.
.TP 12
\f4\ -r\fP
``Raw'' mode: disable the default line buffering and input handling.
This gives you a similar effect as \f4telnet\fP
to port number 25, not very useful.

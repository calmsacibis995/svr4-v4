.SH NAME
\f4shutdown\f1 \- close down the system at a given time
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/usr/ucb/shutdown\f1
[
\f4\-fhknr\f1
]
.I time
[
.I warning-message
\&.\|.\|.
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX  "shutdown command"  ""  "\fLshutdown\fP \(em shut down multiuser operation"
\f4shutdown\f1
provides an automated procedure to notify users when the
system is to be shut down.
.I time
specifies when
\f4shutdown\f1
will bring the system down; it may be the word
\f4now\f1
(indicating an immediate shutdown),
or it may specify a future time in one of two formats:
\f4+\f2number\f1
and
\f2hour\f4:\f2min.\f1
The first form brings the system down in
.I number
minutes, and the second brings the system down
at the time of day indicated in 24-hour notation.
.P
At intervals that get closer as the apocalypse approaches,
warning messages are displayed at terminals of all logged-in users,
and of users who have remote mounts on that machine.
Five minutes before shutdown,
or immediately if shutdown is in less than 5 minutes,
logins are disabled by creating
\f4/etc/nologin\f1
and writing a message there.
If this file exists when a user attempts to log in,
\f4login\f1(1M)
prints its contents and exits.
The file is removed just before
\f4shutdown\f1
exits.
.P
At shutdown time a message is written to the system log daemon,
\f4syslogd\f1(1M),
containing the time of shutdown,
the instigator of the shutdown, and the reason.
Then a terminate signal is sent to
\f4init\f1,
which brings the system down to single-user mode.
.P
The time of the shutdown and the warning message are placed in
\f4/etc/nologin\f1,
which should be used to inform the users as to when the system
will be back up, and why it is going down (or anything else).
.SH OPTIONS
As an alternative to the above procedure, these options can be
specified:
.TP
\f4\-f\f1
Arrange, in the manner of
\f4fastboot\f1(1M),
that when the system is rebooted, the file systems will not
be checked.
.TP
\f4\-h\f1
Execute
\f4halt\f1(1M).
.TP
\f4\-k\f1
Simulate shutdown of the system.
Do not actually shut down the system.
.TP
\f4\-n\f1
Prevent the normal
\f4sync\f1(2)
before stopping.
.TP
\f4\-r\f1
Execute
\f4reboot\f1(1M).

you use the absolute time for shutdown.

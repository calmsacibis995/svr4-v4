.SH NAME
\f4lpc\f1 \- line printer control program
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/usr/ucb/lpc\f1
[
.I command
[
.IR parameter .\|.\|.
] ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\f4lpc\f1
controls the operation of the printer, or of multiple printers.
\f4lpc\f1
commands can be used to start or stop a printer, disable or enable
a printer's spooling queue, rearrange the order of jobs in a queue,
or display the status of each printer\(em\&along with its
spooling queue and printer daemon.
.P
With no arguments,
\f4lpc\f1
runs interactively, prompting with
\f1`\f4lpc>\f1'.
If arguments are supplied,
\f4lpc\f1
interprets the first as a
.I command
to execute; each subsequent argument is taken as a
.I parameter
for that command.
The standard input can be redirected so that
\f4lpc\f1
reads commands from a file.
.P
Commands may be abbreviated to an unambiguous substring.
Note: the
.I printer
parameter is specified just by the name of the printer (as
\f4lw\f1),
not as you would specify it to
\f4lpr\f1(1)
or
\f4lpq\f1(1)
(not as
\f4\-Plw\f1).
.PD 0
.HP
\f4?\f1
.RI [ command ]\|.\|.\|.
.br
.HP
\f4help\f1

.br
Display a short description of each
command specified in the argument list,
or, if no arguments are given, a list of the recognized commands.
.PD
.HP
\f4abort\f1
\f1[\|\f4all\f1\||
.RI [\| printer  \|.\|.\|.\|]\|]
.br
Terminate an active spooling daemon on the local host immediately and
then disable printing (preventing new daemons from being started by
\f4lpr\f1(1))
for the specified printers.
The
\f4abort\f1
command can only be used by the privileged user.
.HP
\f4clean\f1
\f1[\|\f4all\f1\||
.RI [\| printer  \|.\|.\|.\|]\|]
.br
Remove all files created in the spool directory by the daemon
from the specified printer queue(s) on the local machine.
The
\f4clean\f1
command can only be used by the privileged user.
.HP
\f4disable\f1
\f1[\|\f4all\f1\||
.RI [\| printer  \|.\|.\|.\|]\|]
.br
Turn the specified printer queues off.
This prevents new
printer jobs from being entered into the queue by
\f4lpr\f1(1).
The
\f4disable\f1
command can only be used by the privileged user.
.HP
\f4down\f1
\f1[\|\f4all\f1\||
.RI [\| printer  \|.\|.\|.\|]\|]
.RI [ message ]
.br
Turn the specified printer queue off, disable printing and put
.I message
in the printer status file.
The message does not need to be quoted, the
remaining arguments are treated like
\f4echo\f1(1).
This is normally used to take a printer down and let others know why
\f1(\f4lpq\f1(1)
indicates that the printer is down, as does the
\f4status\f1
command).
.HP
\f4enable\f1
\f1[\|\f4all\f1\||
.RI [\| printer  \|.\|.\|.\|]\|]
.br
Enable spooling on the local queue for the listed printers, so that
\f4lpr\f1(1)
can put new jobs in the spool queue.
The
\f4enable\f1
command can only be used by the privileged user.
.TP
\f4exit\f1
.PD 0
.TP
\f4quit\f1
Exit from
\f4lpc\f1.
.PD
.HP
\f4restart\f1
\f1[\|\f4all\f1\||
.RI [\| printer  \|.\|.\|.\|]\|]
.br
Attempt to start a new printer daemon.
This is useful when some abnormal
condition causes the daemon to
die unexpectedly leaving jobs in the queue.
This command can be run by any user.
.HP
\f4start\f1
\f1[\|\f4all\f1\||
.RI [\| printer  \|.\|.\|.\|]\|]
.br
Enable printing and start a spooling
daemon for the listed printers.
The
\f4start\f1
command can only be used by the privileged user.
.HP
\f4status\f1
\f1[\|\f4all\f1\||
.RI [\| printer  \|.\|.\|.\|]\|]
.br
Display the status of daemons and queues on the local machine.
This command can be run by any user.
.HP
\f4stop\f1
\f1[\|\f4all\f1\||
.RI [\| printer  \|.\|.\|.\|]\|]
.br
Stop a spooling daemon after the current
job completes and disable printing.
The
\f4stop\f1
command can only be used by the privileged user.
.HP
\f4topq\f1
.I printer
.RI [\| job# \|.\|.\|.\|]
.RI [\| user \|.\|.\|.\|]
.br
Move the print job(s) specified by
.I job#
or those job(s) belonging to
.I user
to the top (head) of the printer queue.
The
\f4topq\f1
command can only be used by the privileged user.
.HP
\f4up\f1
\f1[\|\f4all\f1\||
.RI [\| printer  \|.\|.\|.\|]\|]
Enable everything and start a new printer daemon.
Undoes the
effects of
\f4down\f1.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP
\f4?Ambiguous command\f1
The abbreviation you typed matches more than one command.
.TP
\f4?Invalid command\f1
You typed a command or abbreviation that was not recognized.
.TP
\f4?Privileged command\f1
You used a command can be executed only by the privileged
user.
.TP
\f4lpc: \f2printer\fP\|: unknown printer to the print service\f1
The
\f4printer\f1
was not found in the
System V
.SM LP
database.
Usually this is a typing mistake; however, it 
may indicate that the printer does not exist on the system.
Use
\f1`\f4lptstat \-p\f1'
to find the reason.
.TP
\f4lpc: error on opening queue to spooler\f1
The connection to
\f4lpsched\f1
on the local machine failed.
This usually means the printer server started at
boot time has died or is hung.
Check if the printer
spooler daemon 
\f4/usr/lib/lp/lpsched\f1
is running.
.TP
\f4lpc: Can't send message to LP print service\f1
.TP
\f4lpc: Can't receive message from LP print service\f1
These indicate that the
.SM LP
print service has been 
stopped.
Get help from the system administrator.
.TP
\f4lpc: Received unexpected message from LP print service\f1
It is likely there is an error in this software.
Get help from system administrator.

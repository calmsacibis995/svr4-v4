.SH NAME
\f4syslogd\f1 \- log system messages
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/usr/sbin/syslogd\f1
[
\f4\-d\f1
] [
\f4\-f\f2configfile\f1
] [
\f4\-m \f2interval\f1
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4syslogd\f1
reads and forwards system messages to the appropriate log files
and/or users, depending upon the priority of a message and the
system facility from which it originates.
The configuration file
\f4/etc/syslog.conf\f1
[see \f4syslog.conf\f1(5)]
controls where messages are forwarded.
\f4syslogd\f1
logs a mark 
.nh
(timestamp)
.hy
message every
\f2interval\f1
minutes (default 20) at priority
\f4LOG_INFO\fP
to the facility whose name is given as
\f4mark\f1
in the
\f4syslog.conf\f1
file.
.PP
A system message consists of a single line of text, which may be
prefixed with a priority code number enclosed in angle-brackets
\f1(\f4<\|>\f1);
priorities are defined in
\f4sys/syslog.h\f1.
.PP
\f4syslogd\f1
reads from the
STREAMS log driver,
\f4/dev/log\f1,
from any transport provider specified in
\f4/etc/netconfig\f1,
\f4/etc/net/\f2transport\f4/hosts\f1,
and
\f4/etc/net/\f2transport\f4/services\f1,
and from the special device
\f4/dev/klog\f1
(for kernel messages).
.PP
\f4syslogd\f1
reads the configuration file when it starts up, and again
whenever it receives a
\s-1HUP\s0
signal, at which time it also closes all files it has open,
re-reads its configuration file, and then opens only the log
files that are listed in that file.
\f4syslogd\f1
exits when it receives a
\f4TERM\fP
signal.
.PP
As it starts up,
\f4syslogd\f1
creates the file
\f4/etc/syslog.pid\f1,
if possible, containing its process
\s-1ID\s0
(\s-1PID\s0).
.PP
The following options are available:
.TP 17
\f4\-d\f1
Turn on debugging.
.TP
\f4\-f\f2configfile\f1
Specify an alternate configuration file.
.TP
\f4\-m \f2interval\f1
Specify an interval, in minutes, between mark messages.

.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4ttymon\fP is a STREAMS-based TTY port monitor.
Its function is to monitor ports, to set terminal modes, baud rates, and
line disciplines for the ports, and 
to connect users or applications to services associated with the ports.
Normally, \f4ttymon\fP is configured 
to run under the
Service Access Controller, \f4sac\fP, as part of the 
Service Access Facility (SAF).
It is configured using the \f4sacadm\fP command.
Each instance of
\f4ttymon\fP can monitor multiple ports.
The ports monitored by an instance of \f4ttymon\fP are specified in the
port monitor's administrative file.
The administrative file is configured using the \f4pmadm\fP
and \f4ttyadm\fP commands.
When an instance of \f4ttymon\fP is invoked by the \f4sac\fP command,
it starts to monitor its ports.
For each port, \f4ttymon\fP first 
initializes the line disciplines, if they are specified, and the speed and
terminal settings.
The values used for initialization are taken from the appropriate
entry in the
TTY settings file.
This file is maintained by the \f4sttydefs\fP command.
Default line disciplines on ports are usually set up by the \f4autopush\fP command
of the Autopush Facility.
.P
\f4ttymon\fP then writes the prompt and waits for user input.
If the user indicates that the speed is inappropriate by pressing the
BREAK key, \f4ttymon\fP tries the next speed and writes the prompt
again.
When valid input
is received, \f4ttymon\fP interprets the per-service configuration file 
for the port, if one exists,
creates a \f4utmp\fP entry if required,
establishes the service environment, and then invokes the service 
associated with the port.
Valid input consists of a string of at least one
non-newline character, terminated
by a carriage return.
After the service terminates,
\f4ttymon\fP cleans up the \f4utmp\fP entry, if one exists,
and returns the port to its initial state.
.P
If \f2autobaud\fP is enabled for a port, \f4ttymon\fP will try to
determine the baud rate on the port automatically. 
Users must enter a carriage return before \f4ttymon\fP can recognize
the baud rate and print the prompt.
Currently, the baud rates that can be determined by \f2autobaud\fP are
\f4110\fP, \f41200\fP, \f42400\fP, \f44800\fP, and \f49600\fP.
.P
If a port is configured as a bidirectional port,
\f4ttymon\fP will allow users to connect to a service, and, if the port is
free, will allow \f4uucico\fP,
\f4cu\fP or \f4ct\fP to use it for dialing out.
If a port is bidirectional, \f4ttymon\fP will wait to read a character
before it prints a prompt.
.sp .5
If the \f2connect-on-carrier\fP flag is set for a port,
\f4ttymon\fP will immediately invoke the port's associated service
when a connection request is received.
The prompt message will not be sent.
.sp .5
If a port is disabled, \f4ttymon\fP will not start any service on that port.
If a disabled message is specified, \f4ttymon\fP will send out the disabled
message when a connection request is received.
If \f4ttymon\fP is disabled, all ports under that instance of
\f4ttymon\fP will also
be disabled.
.SH "SERVICE INVOCATION"
The service \f4ttymon\fP invokes for a port is specified in the
\f4ttymon\fP administrative file. 
\f4ttymon\fP will scan the character string giving the service to
be invoked for this port, looking for a \f4%d\fP or a \f4%%\fP
two-character sequence.
If \f4%d\fP is found, \f4ttymon\fP will modify the service command to be executed
by replacing those two characters by the full path name of
this port (the device name).
If \f4%%\fP is found, they will be replaced
by a single \f4%\fP.
.sp .5
When the service is invoked, file descriptor \f40\fP, \f41\fP,
and \f42\fP are opened to the port
device for reading and writing. The service is invoked with the
user ID, group ID and current home directory set to that of the user name
under which the service was registered with \f4ttymon\fP.
Two environment variables, HOME and TTYPROMPT, are added to the service's environment by \f4ttymon\fP.
HOME is set to the HOME directory of the user name under which the service is
invoked.
TTYPROMPT is set to the prompt string configured for the service on the port.
This is provided so that a service invoked by \f4ttymon\fP has a means of
determining if a prompt was actually issued by \f4ttymon\fP and, if so, what that
prompt actually was.
.sp .5
See \f4ttyadm\fP(1M) for
options that can be set for ports monitored by \f4ttymon\fP under 
the Service Access Controller.
.SH "INVOKING A STAND-ALONE \f4ttymon\fP PROCESS"
A special invocation of \f4ttymon\fP is provided with the
\f4\-g\fP option.
This form of the command should only be called by 
applications 
that need to set the correct baud rate and terminal settings on a port and
then connect to \f4login\fP service, but that cannot be
pre-configured under the SAC.
The following combinations of options can be used with \f4\-g\fP:
.TP 15
\f4-d\fP \f2device\fP
\f2device\fP is the full path name of the port to which \f4ttymon\fP
is to attach. 
If this option is not specified, file descriptor \f40\fP must be set up by
the invoking process to a TTY port.
.TP
\f4\-h\fP
If the -h flag is not set, \f4ttymon\fP will force a
hangup on the line by setting the speed to zero before setting the
speed to the default or specified speed.
.TP
\f4-t\fP \f2timeout\fP 
Specifies that \f4ttymon\fP should exit if no one types anything
in \f2timeout\fP seconds after the prompt is sent.
.TP
\f4\-l\fP \f2ttylabel\fP
\f2ttylabel\fP is a link to a speed and TTY definition in the 
\f4ttydefs\fP file.
This definition tells \f4ttymon\fP at what speed to run initially,
what the initial TTY settings are, 
and what speed to try next if the user indicates that the speed is
inappropriate by pressing the BREAK key.
The default speed is 9600 baud.
.TP
\f4-p\fP \f2prompt\fP
Allows the user to specify a prompt string. The default prompt
is "Login: ".
.TP
\f4-m\fP \f2modules\fP
When initializing the port, \f4ttymon\fP
will pop all modules on the port, and then push \f2modules\fP in the
order specified. \f2modules\fP is a comma-separated list of pushable
modules.
Default modules on the ports are usually set up by the Autopush
Facility.

.SH NOTES
If a port is monitored by more than one \f4ttymon\fP,
it is possible for the \f4ttymon\fPs to send out prompt messages 
in such a way that they compete for input.

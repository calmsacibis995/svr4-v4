.SH NAME
\f4quotacheck\f1 \- file system quota consistency checker
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4quotacheck\f1
[\f4\-v\f1]
[\f4\-p\f1]
\f2filesystem\f1 .\ .\ .

\f4quotacheck\f1
[\f4\-apv\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\f4quotacheck\f1
examines each file system, builds a table of current
disk usage, and compares this table against that stored
in the disk quota file for the file system.
If any inconsistencies are detected, both the quota file
and the current system copy of the incorrect quotas are
updated (the latter only occurs if an active file system
is checked).
.LP
\f4quotacheck\f1
expects each file system to be checked to have a quota
file named
\f4quotas\fP
in the root directory.
If none is present,
\f4quotacheck\f1
will ignore the file system.
.LP
\f4quotacheck\f1
accesses the character special device in calculating the actual disk
usage for each user.
Thus, the file systems checked should be quiescent while
\f4quotacheck\f1
is running.
.P
The options are:
.TP
\f4\-v\f1
Indicate the calculated disk quotas
for each user on a particular file system.
\f4quotacheck\f1
normally reports only those quotas modified.
.TP
\f4\-a\f1
Check the file systems indicated in
\f4/etc/mnttab\f1
to be read-write with disk quotas.
Only those file systems that have "rq"
in the \f4mntopts\fP field of the \f4/etc/vfstab\fP
file are checked.
.TP
\f4\-p\f1
Run parallel passes on the required file systems.

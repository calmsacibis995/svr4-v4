.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4pkgadd\f1
transfers the contents of a software package from the distribution medium or
directory to install it onto the system.
Used without the \f4-d\f1 option, \f4pkgadd\f1 looks in the default spool
directory for the package (\f4/var/spool/pkg\f1).
Used with the \f4\-s\f1 option, it reads the
package to a spool directory instead of in\%stalling it.
.TP 10
\f4-d \f2device\f1
Installs or copies a package from \f2device\f1.
\f2device\f1 can be a full pathname to a
directory or the identifiers for tape, floppy disk or removable disk
(for example,
\f4/var/tmp\f1, 
\f4/dev/rmt/c0s0\f1,
\f4/dev/dsk/f0t\f1
or
\f4/dev/dsk/f1t\f1).
It can also be the device alias (for example,
\f4ctape1\f1 for the cartridge tape drive).
.TP 10
\f4-r \f2response\f1
Identifies a file or directory, \f2response\f1, which contains output from a
previous \f4pkgask\f1 session.
This file supplies the interaction responses
that would be requested by the package in interactive mode.
\f2response\f1 must be a full pathname.
.TP 10
\f4-n\f1
Installation occurs in non-interactive mode.
The default mode is interactive.
.TP 10
\f4-a \f2admin\f1
Defines an installation administration file, \f2admin\fP, to be used in 
place of the default administration file.
The token \f4none\f1 overrides the use of any \f2admin\fP file,
and thus forces interaction with the user.
Unless a full path name is given, \f4pkgadd\f1 looks in
the \f4/var/sadm/install/admin\f1 directory for the file.
.TP 10
\f2pkginst\f1
Specifies the package instance or list of instances to be installed.
The token \f4all\f1 may be used
to refer to all packages available on the source medium.
The format \f2pkginst\f4.\(**\f1 can be used to indicate all instances
of a package.
When using this format,
enclose the command line in single quotes
to prevent the shell from interpreting the \(** character.
.TP 10
\f4-s \f2spool\f1
Reads the package into the directory \f2spool\f1 instead of installing it.
.sp .5
When executed without options, \f4pkgadd\f1 users \f4/var/spool/pkg\f1 (the
default spool directory).
.SH NOTES
When transferring a package to a spool directory, the \f4-r\f1, \f4-n\f1, and
\f4-a\f1 options cannot be used.
.P
The \f4-r\f1 option can be used to indicate a directory name as well as a
filename.
The directory can contain
numerous \f2response\f1 files, each sharing the name of the package with which
it should be associated.
This would be used, for example,
when adding multiple interactive packages
with one invocation of \f4pkgadd\f1.
Each package would need a \f2response\f1 file.
If you create response files
with the same name as the package 
(that is, \f2package1\fP and \f2package2\fP), then
name the directory in which these files reside after the \f4-r\f1.
.P
The \f4-n\f1 option will cause the installation to halt if
any interaction is needed to complete it.

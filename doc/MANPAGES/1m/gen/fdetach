.SH NAME
\f4fdetach\fP \- detach a name from a \s-1STREAMS\s+1-based file descriptor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\f4fdetach path\f1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4fdetach\f1 command detaches a \s-1STREAMS\s+1-based file descriptor from
a name in the file system.
\f2path\f1 is the path name of the object in the file system name space,
which was previously attached [see \f4fattach\f1(3C)].
The user must be the owner of the file or a user with the appropriate privileges.
All subsequent operations on \f2path\f1 will operate on the file system node
and not on the \s-1STREAMS\s+1 file.
The permissions and status of the node are restored to the state the node was
in before the \s-1STREAMS\s+1 file was attached to it.

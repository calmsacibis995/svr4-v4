.SH SYNOPSIS

\f4bkstatus\f1
[\f4\-h\f1]
[\f4\-f \f2field_separator\f1]
[\f4\-j \f2jobids\f1]
[\f4\-s \f2states\f1 | \f4-a\f1]
[\f4\-u \f2users\f1]

\f4bkstatus \-p \f2period\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
Without options, the
\f4bkstatus\f1
command displays the status of backup operations that are in progress:
either
\f4active\f1,
\f4pending\f1,
\f4waiting\f1
or
\f4suspended\f1.
When used with the \f4\-a\f1 option,
the \f4backup\f1 command
includes \f4failed\f1 and \f4completed\f1
backup operations in the display.
.P
\f4bkstatus \-p\f1
defines the amount of status
information that is saved for display.
.P
\f4bkstatus\f1
may only be executed by a user with superuser privilege.
.P
Each backup operation goes through a number of states
as described below.
The keyletters listed in parentheses after each state are
used with the \f4\-s\f1 option and also appear on the
display.
.TP 10
\f4pending(p)\f1
\f4backup\f1
has been invoked and
the operations in the backup register
for the specified day are scheduled to occur.
.TP 10
\f4active(a)\f1
The backup operation has been assigned a destination device
and archiving is currently underway;
or a suspended backup has been resumed.
.TP 10
\f4waiting(w)\f1
The backup operation is waiting for operator interaction,
such as inserting the correct volume.
.TP 10
\f4suspended(s)\f1
The backup operation has been suspended by an invocation of
\f4backup \-S\f1.
.TP 10
\f4failed(f)\f1
The backup operation failed or has been cancelled.
.TP 10
\f4completed(c)\f1
The backup operation has completed successfully.
.TP 10
The \f4-a\f1 and \f4-s\f1 options are mutually exclusive.
.SS Options
.TP 10
\f4\-a\f1
Include
\f4failed\f1
and
\f4completed\f1
backup operations in the display.
All backup operations that have occurred within the
rotation period are displayed.
.TP 10
\f4\-f\f2 field_separator\f1
Suppresses field wrap on the display and
specifies an output field separator to be used.
The value of \f2c\f1 is the character
that will appear as the field separator on the display output.
For clarity of output,
do not use a separator character that is likely to
occur in a field.
For example, do not use the colon as a
field separator character if the display
will contain dates that use
a colon to separate hours from minutes.
To use the default field separator (tab), specify the
null character (\f4""\f1) for \f2c\f1.
.TP 10
\f4\-h\f1
Suppress header on the display.
.TP 10
\f4\-j\f2 jobids\f1
Restrict the display to the specified list of
\f4backup\f1 job ids
(either comma-separated or blank-separated and enclosed in quotes).
[See \f4backup\f1(1M)].
.TP 10
\f4\-p\f2 period\f1
Define the amount of backup status information that is
saved and made available for display as \f2period\f1.
\f2period\f1 is the number of weeks that information
is saved in \f4/bkup/bkstatus.tab\f1.
Status information that is older than the number of
weeks specified in \f2period\f1
is deleted from the status table.
The minimum valid entry is 1.  The maximum
valid entry is 52.
The default is 1 week.
.TP 10
\f4\-s\f2 states\f1
Restrict the report to backup operations with the specified
.I states.
.I states
is a list of state key-letters
(concatenated, comma-separated or blank-separated and surrounded
by quotes).
For example,
.nf
	\f4apf
	a,p,f
	"a p f"\f1
.fi
all specify that the report should only include backup operations
that are
\f4active\f1,
\f4pending\f1
or
\f4failed\f1.
.TP 10
\f4\-u\f2 users\f1
Restrict the display to backup operations started by the specified list of
.IR users
(either comma-separated or blank-separated and enclosed in quotes).
\f2users\f1 must be in the \f4passwd\f1 file.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS 
The exit codes for the \f4bkstatus\f1 command are the following:
.PP
\f40\f1 = successful completion of the task
.br
\f41\f1 = one or more parameters to \f4bkstatus\fP are invalid.
.br
\f42\f1 = an error has occurred which caused \f4bkstatus\fP to fail to
      complete \f2all\f1 portions of its task.
.SH EXAMPLES
Example 1:
.P
.in 1.0i
\f4bkstatus \-p 4\f1
.in 0
.P
specifies that backup status information
is to be saved for four weeks.
Any status information
older than four weeks is deleted from the system.
.P
Example 2:
.P
.in 1.0i
\f4bkstatus \-a \-j back-459,back-395\f1
.in 0
.P
produces a display that shows status
for the two backup jobs specified, even if they 
have \f4completed\f1 or \f4failed\f1.
.bp
Example 3:
.P
.in 1.0i
\f4bkstatus \-s a,c \-u "oper3 oper4"\f1
.in 0
.P
produces a display that shows only those backup jobs
issued by users \f4oper3\f1 and \f4oper4\f1
that have a status of either \f4active\f1 or \f4completed\f1.

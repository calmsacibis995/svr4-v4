.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4lpsched\fP
starts the LP print service;
this can be done only by \f4root\f1 or \f4lp\f1.
.PP
\f4lpshut\fP
shuts down the print service.
All printers that are printing
at the time \f4lpshut\fP is invoked
will stop printing.
When \f4lpsched\fP is started again,
requests that were printing at the time
a printer was shut down will be reprinted
from the beginning.
.PP
\f4lpmove\fP moves requests that were queued by \f4lp\fP
between \s-1LP\s+1
destinations.
The first form of the \f4lpmove\fP command shown above 
(under \f3\s-1SYNOPSIS\s+1\f1)
moves the named
.I requests
to the \s-1LP\s+1 destination
.IR dest .
.I Requests
are request-\s-1ID\s+1s
as returned by \f4lp\fP.
The second form of the \f4lpmove\fP command 
will attempt to move
all requests for destination
\f2dest1\fP
to destination
\f2dest2\fP;
\f4lp\fP will then reject any new requests for
\f2dest1\fP.
.PP
Note that when moving requests,
\f4lpmove\fP never checks the acceptance status [see \f4accept\fP(1M)]
of the new destination.
Also, the request-\s-1ID\s+1s of the moved request are not changed,
so that users can still find their requests.
The \f4lpmove\fP command will not move requests that have options
(content type, form required, and so on)
that cannot be handled by the new destination.
.PP
If a request was originally queued for a
class or the special destination \f4any\f1,
and the first form of \f4lpmove\f1 was used,
the destination of the request will be changed to \f2new-destination\f1.
A request thus affected will be
printable only on \f2new-destination\f1 and not on other
members of the \f4class\f1 or other acceptable printers if the
original destination was \f4any\f1.

.TP 5
\f4\-q\f2\\f4integer\f1
Specify the number of request structures 
you want to allocate.
.TP 5
\f4\-a\f2\\f4integer\f1
Specify the number of alert structures 
you want to allocate.
By default,
forty empty alert structures are allocated
in addition to one
for each printer or form on the system.
Structures will always be allocated for existing printers and forms.
You can choose, however, to have
more or fewer than the 
forty extra, by using the \f4\-a\f1 option.
For example, if you want only
as many alert structures as you have
printers and forms on your system,
enter the following command:  \f4lpsched \-a 0\f1.
.TP 5
\f4\-p\f2\\f4integer\f1
Specify the number of print status structures
you want to allocate.
By default,
twenty-five empty printer status structures are allocated
in addition to one
for each printer on the system.
Structures will always be allocated for existing printers.
You can choose, however, to have
more or fewer than the 
forty extra, by using the \f4\-p\f1 option.
.TP 5
\f4\-s\f2\\f4integer\f1
Specify the number of slow filters per printer that
can be run simultaneously.

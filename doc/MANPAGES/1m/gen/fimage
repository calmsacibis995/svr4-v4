.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4fimage\fP command is invoked as a child process by other
shell commands.
The command name, \f4fimage\fP, is read either from the
\f4bkhist.tab\f1 file or the \f4bkreg \-m\f1 command and option.
The \f4 \-B, \-R, \-F, \f1and \f4\-C \f1options
are passed to \f4fimage\fP by
the shell commands \f4backup\fP, \f4restore\fP,
and \f4urestore\f1 described below.
The other options are passed from the
\f4bkhist.tab\f1 file or the \f4bkreg -p\f1 command and option.
The arguments are sent to \f4fimage\fP from various locations
in the backup service.
\f4fimage\fP neither reads from standard-input
nor writes to standard-output or standard-error.
.PP
\f4fimage \f4\-B\f1 is invoked as a child process by \f4bkdaemon\fP
to perform an image backup of the filesystem
.I ofsname
(the originating filesystem).
All files in
.I ofsname
are archived.
The resulting backup is created in the format described on
\f4volcopy\fP(1M).
The backup is recorded in the backup history log,
\f4/etc/bkup/bkhist.tab\fP.
.PP
\f4fimage \-RC\f1 and \f4\-RF\f1 are invoked as child processes by
the \f4rsoper\fP command to extract files from an image archive
created by \f4fimage \-B\f1.
The filesystem archive is assumed to be in the format described on
\f4volcopy\fP format.
.PP
If the \f4\-RC\f1
option is selected, the entire filesystem is restored.
.PP
If the \f4\-RF\f1 option is specified,
only selected objects from the archive are restored.
Each 7-tuple, composed of
.IR rsjobid:uid:date:type:name:rename:inode ,
specifies an object to be restored from the filesystem archive.
The 7-tuple objects come to \f4fimage\fP from the \f4rsstatus.tab\f1
file.
.P
The arguments to \f4fimage\fP are defined as follows:
.TP .7i
.I bkjobid
the job id assigned by \f4backup\fP.
The method uses the \f2bkjobid\f1 when it creates
history log and table-of-contents entries.
.TP
.I ofsname
the name of the file system that is to be backed up.
.TP
.I ofsdev
the name of the block special device on which the file system
resides.
.TP
.I ofslab
the volume name on the file system [see \f4labelit\fP(1M)].
.TP
.I descript
is a description for a destination device in the form:
.sp .15
.nf
.I
  	dgroup:dname:dchar:dlabels
.fi
.sp .15
.I dgroup
specifies a device group [see \f4devgroup.tab\fP(4)].
.br
\f2dname\fP
specifies a particular device name [see \f4device.tab\fP(4)].
.br
.I dchars
specifies characteristics associated with the device.
If specified, \f2dchar\f1 overrides the defaults for the specified
device and group.
[See \f4device.tab\fP(4)
for a further description of device characteristics.]
.I dlabels
specifies the volume names for
the media to be used for reading or writing the archive.
.TP
.I refsname
if non-null,
the name of the file system to be restored to instead of
.IR ofsname .
At least one of
.I refsname
and
.I redev
must be null.
.TP
.I redev
if non-null, the partition to be restored to instead of
.IR ofsdev .
At least one of
.I refsname
and
.I redev
must be null.
.TP
.I rsjobid
the restore jobid assigned by
\f4restore\fP or \f4urestore\fP.
.TP
.I uid
the real uid of the user who requested the object to be restored.
It must match the uid of the owner of the object at the
time the archive was made, or it must be the superuser uid.
.TP
.I date
the newest "last modification time" that is acceptable for a
restorable
object.
The object is restored from the archive immediately
older than this date.
.I date
is a hexadecimal representation of the date and time provided
by the \f4time\fP system call [see \f4time\fP(2)].
.TP
.I type
either \f4F\fP or \f4D\fP,
indicating that the object is a file or a directory,
respectively.
.TP
.I name
the name the object had in the file system archive.
.TP
\f2rename\fP
the name that the object should be restored to (it may differ
from the name the object had in the file system archive).
If omitted, the object is restored to
.I name.
.TP
\f2inode\fP
the inode number of the object as it was stored in the file system
archive.
.I [inode]
is not used by
\f4ffile \-R\f1,
and is provided only for command-line compatibility with
other restoration methods.
.SS Options
Some options are only significant during
\f4fimage \-B\f1 invocations;  they are accepted but ignored during
\f4fimage \-R\f1
invocations because the command is invoked and options are specified
automatically by \f4restore\fP.
These options are flagged with an asterisk (*).
.TP 10
\f4d*\f1
Inhibits recording the archive in the backup history log.
.TP 10
\f4l*\f1
Creates a long form of the backup history log that includes a table-of-contents
for the archive.
This includes the data used to generate a
listing of each file in the archive (like that produced by the
\f4ls \-l\fP command).
.TP 10
\f4m*\f1
Mounts the originating filesystem read-only before starting the backup
and remounts it with its original permissions after completing the backup.
Cannot be used with \f4root\f1 or \f4/usr\f1 filesystems.
.TP 10
\f4o\f1
Permits the user to override media insertion requests [see
\f4getvol\fP(1M) and the description of the \f4\-o\fP option].
.TP 10
\f4t*\f1
Creates a table of contents for the backup on additional media instead of
in the backup history log.
.TP 10
\f4u*\f1
Unmounts the originating filesystem before the
backup is begun.
After the backup is complete, remounts
the filesystem under its original permission.
This option
cannot be used with a \f4root\f1 or \f4usr\f1 filsystem.
The \f4\-u\f1 option overrides the \f4\-m\f1 option.
.TP 10
\f4v*\f1
Validates the archive as it is written.
A checksum is computed as the archive is being written;
as each medium is completed, it is re-read and the checksum
recomputed to verify that each block is readable and correct.
If either check fails, the medium is considered unreadable.
If
\f4\-A\f1
has been specified, the archiving operation fails;
otherwise, the operator is prompted to replace the failed medium.
.TP 10
\f4A\f1
Do not prompt the user for removable media operations (automated operation).
.TP 10
\f4E*\f1
Reports an estimate of media usage for the archive;
then performs the backup.
.TP 10
\f4N*\f1
Reports an estimate of media usage for the archive;
does not perform the backup.
.TP 10
\f4S\f1
Displays
a period (.) for every 100 (512 byte) blocks read-from or written-to
the archive on the destination device.
.SS User Interactions
The connection between an archiving method and
\f4backup\fP is more complex than a simple fork/exec or pipe.
The \f4backup\fP command
is responsible for all interactions with the user,
either directly, or through \f4bkoper\fP.
Therefore, \f4ffile\fP
neither reads from standard-input nor writes to standard-output or
standard-error.
A method library must be used [see \f4libbrmeth\fP(3)]
to communicate reports (estimates, filenames, periods, status, etc.)
to \f4backup\fP.

The commands \f4devreserv\f1 and \f4devfree\f1 are used to manage the 
availability of devices on a system.
These commands do not place any 
constraints on the access to the device.
They serve only as a centralized
bookkeeping point for those who wish to use them.
Processes that do not use
\f4devreserv\f1 may concurrently use a device with a process that has reserved
that device.

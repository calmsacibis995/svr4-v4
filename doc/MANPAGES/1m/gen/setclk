.SH NAME
\f4setclk\f1 \- set system time from hardware clock
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/sbin/setclk\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4setclk\fP
is used to set the internal system time from
the hardware time-of-day clock.
The command can be used only by the super-user.
It is normally executed by an entry in the
\f4/etc/inittab\f1
file when the system is initialized at boot time.
Note that 
\f4setclk\fP
checks the Nonvolatile Random Access Memory
(\s-1NVRAM\s+1) only for the date.
If the date is set,
\f4setclk\fP
runs silently.
If the date is not set,
\f4setclk\fP
prompts the user to use
\f4sysadm  datetime\f1
[see
\f4sysadm\fP(1)]
for the proper setting of the hardware clock.
.SH SEE ALSO
\f4sysadm\fP(1) in the
\f2User's Reference Manual\f1.

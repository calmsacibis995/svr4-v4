.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4lpforms\f1 command is used to administer the
use of preprinted forms, such as company
letterhead paper, with the \s-1LP\s+1 print service.
A form is specified by its \f2form-name\f1.
Users may specify a form when
submitting a print request [see \f4lp\f1(1)].
The argument \f4all\f1 can be used instead of 
\f2form-name\f1 with either of 
the command lines shown above.
The first command line allows
the administrator to add, change, and delete forms,
to list the attributes of an existing form, and to
allow and deny users access to particular forms.
The second command line is used to
establish the method by which the administrator is
alerted that the form \f2form-name\fP must be mounted on a printer.
.P
With the first \f4lpforms\f1 command line,
one of the following options must be used:
.TP 1.125i
\f4\-F\f2\ pathname\f1
To add or change form \f2form-name\fP,
as specified by the information in \f2pathname\f1
.TP
\f4\-\f1
To add or change form \f2form-name\fP, 
as specified by the information from standard input
.TP
\f4\-x\f1
To delete form \f2form-name\fP (this option must be used separately;
it may not be used with any other option)
.TP
\f4\-l\f1
To list the attributes of form \f2form-name\fP
.SS "Adding or Changing a Form"
The \f4\-F\f2 pathname\f1 option is used to 
add a new form, \f2form-name\fP, to the LP print service, or to change
the attributes of an existing form.
The form description is taken from
.I "pathname"
if the \f4\-F\f1 option is given,
or from the standard input if the \f4\-\f1 option is used.
One of these two options must be used to define or change a form.
\f2Pathname\f1 is the
path name of a file that contains 
all or any subset of 
the following information about the form.
.sp
.nf
\f4Page length\f1:  \f2scaled-decimal-number1\fP
\f4Page width\f1:  \f2scaled-decimal-number2\fP
\f4Number of pages\f1: \f2integer\f1
\f4Line pitch\f1:  \f2scaled-decimal-number3\fP
\f4Character pitch\f1:  \f2scaled-decimal-number4\fP
\f4Character set choice\f1: \f2character-set/print-wheel\f1 [\f4mandatory\f1]

.fi
.sp
The term ``scaled-decimal-number''
refers to a non-negative number
used to indicate a unit of size.
The type of unit is shown 
by a ``trailing'' letter attached to the number.
Three types of scaled decimal numbers
can be used with the \s-1LP\s+1 print service: numbers
that show sizes in centimeters
(marked with a trailing \f4c\fP);
numbers that show sizes in inches
(marked with a trailing \f4i\fP);
and numbers that show sizes in units appropriate to use
(without a trailing letter),
that is, lines, characters, lines per inch, or characters per inch.
.P
Except for the last two lines, the above lines may appear
in any order.
The \f4Comment:\f1 and \f2comment\f1
items must appear in consecutive order
but may appear before the other items,
and the \f4Alignment pattern:\f1
and the \f2content\f1 items
must appear in consecutive order at the end of the file.
Also, the \f2comment\f1 item
may not contain a line that begins with any of the key
phrases above, unless the key phrase is
preceded with a \f4>\f1 sign.
Any leading > sign found in the
\f2comment\f1
will be removed when the comment is displayed.
Case distinctions in the key phrases are ignored.
.sp
When this command is issued,
the form specified by \f2form-name\f1
is added to the list of forms.
If the form already exists,
its description is changed to reflect the new information.
Once added,
a form is available for use in a print request,
except where access to the form has been restricted,
as described under the \f4\-u\f1 option.
A form may also be allowed to be used
on certain printers only.
.PP
A description of each form attribute is below:
.TP
\f4Page length and Page Width\fP
Before printing the content of a print request needing this form,
the generic interface program provided with 
the \s-1LP\s+1 print service will
initialize the physical printer to handle pages
\f2scaled-decimal-number1\fP
long, and
\f2scaled-decimal-number2\fP
wide using the printer type as a key into the 
\f4terminfo\f1 database.
.P
The page length and page width will also be passed,
if possible,
to each filter used in a request needing this form.
.TP
\f4Number of pages\fP
Each time the alignment pattern is printed,
the \s-1LP\s+1 print service will attempt to truncate the
.I "content"
to a single form by,
if possible,
passing to each filter the page subset of
1\(hy\f2integer\f1.
.TP 
\f4Line pitch\fP and \f4Character pitch\fP
Before printing the content of a print request needing this form,
the interface programs provided with the 
\s-1LP\s+1 print service will
initialize the physical printer to handle these pitches,
using the printer type as a key into the \f4terminfo\f1 database.
Also, the pitches will be passed, if possible,
to each filter used in a request needing this form.
\f2scaled-decimal-number3\fP
is in lines per centimeter if a \f4c\fP is appended,
and lines per inch otherwise;
similarly,
\f2scaled-decimal-number4\fP
is in characters per centimeter if a \f4c\fP is appended,
and characters per inch otherwise.
The character pitch can also be given as
\f4elite\f1 (12 characters per inch),
\f4pica\f1 (10 characters per inch),
or \f4compressed\f1 (as many characters per inch as possible).
.TP
\f4Character set choice\fP
When the \s-1LP\s+1 print service alerts an administrator to mount this form,
it will also mention that the print wheel
.I "print-wheel"
should be used on those printers that take print wheels.
If printing with this form is to be done on a printer that has
selectable or loadable character sets instead of print wheels,
the interface programs provided with the 
\s-1LP\s+1 print service
will automatically select or load the correct character set.
If \f4mandatory\f1 is appended,
a user is not allowed to select a different character set for
use with the form;
otherwise,
the character set or print wheel named is a suggestion and
a default only.
.TP
\f4Ribbon color\fP
When the \s-1LP\s+1 print service alerts an administrator to mount this form,
it will also mention that the color of the ribbon should be
.IR "ribbon-color" .
.TP
\f4Comment\fP
The \s-1LP\s+1 print service will display the
.I "comment"
unaltered when a user asks about this form 
[see \f4lpstat\f1(1)].
.TP
\f4Alignment pattern\fP
When mounting this form 
an administrator can ask for the
.I "content"
to be printed repeatedly,
as an aid in correctly positioning the preprinted form.
The optional
.I "content-type"
defines the type of printer for which
.I "content"
had been generated.
If
.I "content-type"
is not given, \f4simple\f1 is assumed.
Note that the
.I "content"
is stored as given,
and will be readable only by the user \f4lp\f1.
.PP
When an existing form is changed with this command,
items missing in the new information are left as they were.
When a new form is added with this command,
missing items will get the following defaults:
.sp
Page Length: \f466\f1
.br
Page Width: \f480\f1
.br
Number of Pages: \f41\f1
.br
Line Pitch: \f46\f1
.br
Character Pitch: \f410\f1
.br
Character Set Choice: \f4any\f1
.br
Ribbon Color: \f4any\f1
.SS "Deleting a Form"
The \f4\-x\f1 option is used to 
delete the form
\f2form-name\f1 from the \s-1LP\s+1 
print service.
.SS "Listing Form Attributes"
The \f4\-l\f1 option is used to 
list the attributes of the existing form
\f2form-name\f1.
The attributes listed are those described under
.B "Adding and Changing a Form,"
above.
Because of the potentially sensitive nature of the alignment pattern,
only the administrator 
can examine the form with this command.
Other people may use the \f4lpstat\f1 command 
to examine the non-sensitive part of the form description.
.SS "Allowing and Denying Access to a Form"
The 
\f4\-u\fP option, followed by the argument
\f4allow:\f2login-ID-list\f1
or \f4\-u\ deny:\f2login-ID-list\f1
lets you
determine which users will be allowed
to specify a particular form with a print request.
This option can be used 
with the \f4\-F\f1 or \f4\-\f1 option,
each of which is described above under
\f3\s-1Adding or Changing a Form\s+1\f1.
.PP
The \f2login-ID-list\f1 argument
may include any or all of the following constructs: 
.TP 1.4i
\f2login-ID\f1
A user on any system
.TP
\f2system_name\f4!\f2login-ID\f1
A user on system \f2system_name\f1
.TP
\f2system_name\f4!all\f1
All users on system \f2system_name\f1
.TP
\f4all!\f2login-ID\f1
A user on all systems
.TP
\f4all\f1
All users on all systems
.PP
The \s-1LP\s+1 print service keeps 
two lists of users for each form:
an ``allow-list'' of people allowed to use the form,
and a ``deny-list'' of people that may not use the form.
With the \f4\-u\ allow\fP option,
the users listed are added to the allow-list and removed from
the deny-list.
With the \f4\-u\ deny\fP option,
the users listed are 
added to the deny-list and removed from the allow-list.
(Both forms of the \f4\-u\f1 option can be run together 
with the \f4\-F\f1 or the \f4\-\f1 option.)
.PP
If the allow-list is not empty, 
only the users in the list are allowed access to the form,
regardless of the contents of the deny-list.
If the allow-list is empty but the deny-list is not,
the users in the deny-list may not use the form,
(but all others may use it).
All users can be denied access to a form 
by specifying \f4\-f deny:all\fP.
All users can be allowed access to a form 
by specifying \f4\-f allow:all\fP.
(This is the default.)
.SS "Setting an Alert to Mount a Form"
The \f4\-f \f2form-name\f1 option
is used with the
\f4\-A \f2alert-type\f1 option
to define an alert
to mount the form when there are queued jobs which need it.
If this option is not used to arrange alerting
for a form, no alert will be sent for that form.
.P
The method by which the alert is sent
depends on the value of 
the \f2alert-type\f1 argument specified with the
\f4\-A\f1 option.
The \f2alert-types\f1 are:
.RS 5
.TP 8
\f4mail\f1
Send the alert message via the \f4mail\fP command
to the administrator.
.TP 8
\f4write\f1
Write the message,
via the \f4write\fP command,
to the terminal on which the
administrator is logged in.
If the administrator is logged in on several
terminals, one is arbitrarily chosen. 
.TP 8
\f4quiet\f1
Do not send messages for the current condition.
An administrator can use this option to
temporarily stop receiving further messages about
a known problem.
Once the form \f2form-name\f1 has been mounted
and subsequently unmounted,
messages will again be sent when the number of print requests
reaches the threshold specified by the \f4\-Q\fP option.
.TP 8
\f4none\f1
Do not send messages until the \f4\-A\f1 option
is given again with a different \f2alert-type\f1
(other than \f4quiet\f1).
.TP
.I shell-command
Run the \f2shell-command\f1 each time the alert needs to
be sent.
The shell command should expect the message in
standard input.
If there are blanks embedded in the command,
enclose the command in quotes.
Note that the \f4mail\f1 and \f4write\f1 values for
this option are equivalent to the values
\f4mail\f1 \f2login-\s-1ID\s+1\f1 and \f4write\f1 
\f2login-\s-1ID\s+1\f1 respectively, where \f2login-\s-1ID\s+1\f1
is the current name for the administrator.
This will be the login name of the person submitting this command
unless he or she has used the \f4su\fP command
to change to another login-\s-1ID\s+1.
If the \f4su\fP command has been used 
to change the user \s-1ID\s+1,
then the \f2user-name\f1 
for the new \s-1ID\s+1 is used.
.TP
\f4list\f1
Display the type of the alert for the form
on standard output.
No change is made to the alert.
.RE
.PP
The message sent appears as follows:
.ftCW
.sp
.RS 3
\f4The form \f2form-name\f4 needs to be mounted
.br
on the printer(s):
.br
\f2printer\f4 (\f2integer1\f4 requests)\f1.
.br
\f2integer2\fP print requests await this form.
.br
Use the \f2ribbon-color\f4 ribbon.
.br
Use the \f2print-wheel\f4 print wheel, if appropriate.
.ft1
.RE
.P
The printers listed are those that the administrator had
earlier specified were candidates for this form.
The number $integer sub 1$ listed next to each printer
is the number of requests eligible for the printer.
The number $integer sub 2$ shown after the list of printers
is the total number of requests awaiting the form.
It will be less than the sum of the other numbers if some requests can
be handled by more than one printer.
The
.I "ribbon-color"
and
.I "print-wheel"
are those specified in the form description.
The last line in the message is always sent,
even if none of the printers listed use print wheels,
because the administrator may choose to mount the form on a
printer that does use a print wheel.
.P
Where any color ribbon or any print wheel can be used,
the statements above will read:
.sp
\f4Use any ribbon.
.br
Use any print-wheel.\f1
.fi
.PP
If \f2form-name\fP is \f4any\fP,
the alerting defined in this command
applies to any form for which
an alert has not yet been defined.
If \f2form-name\fP is \f4all\fP,
the alerting defined in this command
applies to all forms.
.PP
If the \f4\-W\f1
option is not given, 
the default procedure is that 
only one message will be sent
per need to mount the form.
Not specifying the \f4\-W\fP option
is equivalent to specifying
\f4\-W once\fP or \f4\-W 0\fP.
If \f2minutes\fP is a number greater than 0,
an alert will be sent at intervals
specified by \f2minutes\fP.
.P
If the \f4\-Q\fP option is also given,
the alert will be sent when a certain number
(specified by the argument \f2requests\fP)
of print requests that need the form are waiting.
If the \f4\-Q\f1 option is not given,
or the value of \f2requests\fP is \f41\fP or \f4any\fP
(which are both the default),
a message is sent as soon as 
anyone submits a print request for the form
when it is not mounted.
.SS "Listing the Current Alert"
The \f4\-f\fP option, followed by the \f4\-A\fP option
and the argument \f4list\fP
is used to list the type of alert that has been defined
for the specified form \f2form-name\fP.
No change is made to the alert.
If
.I "form-name"
is recognized by the \s-1LP\s+1 print service,
one of the following lines is sent to the standard output,
depending on the type of alert for the form.
.P
.RS

The phrase \f4every\f1 \f2minutes\fP \f4minutes\fP is
replaced with \f4once\f1 if
\f2minutes\fP
(\f4\-W\f2
\f2minutes\fP)
\f1is 0.
.SS "Terminating an Active Alert"
The \f4\-A quiet\f1 option is used to stop
messages for the current condition.
An administrator can use this option to temporarily stop
receiving further messages about a known problem.
Once the form has been mounted and then unmounted,
messages will again be sent when the number of print requests reaches
the threshold \f2requests\fP.
.SS "Removing an Alert Definition"
No messages will be sent after the \f4\-A none\f1 option is used
until the \f4\-A \f1 option is given
again with a different
.IR "alert-type" .
This can be used 
to permanently stop further messages from being sent
as any existing alert definition for the form will be removed.

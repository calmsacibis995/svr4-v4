.SH NAME
\f4du\f1 \- summarize disk usage
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4du\f1\0[\f4\-sar\f1] [\f2name\fP ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4du\fP command
reports the number of blocks contained in all files
and (recursively) directories within each directory and
file specified.
The block count includes the indirect blocks of the file.
If no \f2name\fPs are given, the current directory is used.
.PP
The optional arguments are as follows:
.PP
.TP
\f4\-s\f1
causes only the grand total (for each of the specified
\f2name\fPs) to be given.
.TP
\f4\-a\f1
causes an output line to be generated for each file.
.PP
If neither \f4\-s\f1 or \f4\-a\f1 is specified, an output line
is generated for each directory only.
.PP
.TP
\f4\-r\f1
will cause \f4du\fP to generate messages about directories that cannot be
be read, files that cannot be opened, etc., rather than being silent
(the default).
.PP
A file with two or more links is only counted once.
.SH NOTES
If the \f4\-a\f1 option is not used, non-directories
given as arguments are not listed.
.P
If there are links between files in different directories
where the directories are on separate branches of the file
system hierarchy,
\f4du\fP
will count the excess files more than once.
.P
Files with holes in them will get an incorrect
block count.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
See the chapter on file system administration in the 
\f2System Administrator's Guide\f1.

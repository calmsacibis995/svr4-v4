.SH NAME
\f4quot\f1 \- summarize file system ownership
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4quot\f1
[
\f4\-acfhnv\f1
] [
.I filesystem
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\f4quot\f1
displays the number of blocks (1024 bytes) in the named
.I filesystem
currently owned by each user.
There is a limit of 2048 blocks.
Files larger than this will be counted as a 2048 block file,
but the total blocks count will be correct.
.P
The options are:
.TP
\f4\-a\f1
Generate a report for all mounted file systems.
.TP
\f4\-c\f1
Display three columns giving a file size in blocks, the number of
files of that size, and a cumulative total of blocks
containing files of that size or a smaller size.
Files exceeding 499 blocks are listed as 499 blocks.
The last line always lists 499 blocks,
even if there are no files of that size.
.TP
\f4\-f\f1
Display count of number of files as well as space owned by each user.
This option is incompatible with the \f4-c\fP and \f4-v\fP options.
.TP
\f4\-h\f1
Estimate the number of blocks in the file \(em this
does not account for files with holes in them.
.TP
\f4\-n\f1
Attach names to the list of files read from standard input.
\f4quot -n\fP cannot be used alone, because it expects data
from standard input.
For example, the pipeline
.sp .2
	\f4ncheck filesystem | sort +0n | quot \-n filesystem\f1
.sp .2
will produce a list of all files and their owners.
This option is incompatible with all other options.
.TP
\f4\-v\f1
In addition to the default output,
display three columns containing the number of blocks
not accessed in the last 30, 60, and 90 days.
.SH NOTES
This command may only be used by a privileged user.

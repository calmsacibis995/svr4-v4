.SH NAME
\f4fuser\f1 \- identify processes using a file or file structure
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/usr/sbin/fuser\f1
\f1[\f4\|\-[c|f]ku\|\f1]
\f2files\f1 | \f2resources\f1
\f1[\|[\f4\|\-\|\f1]
\f1[\f4\|\-\[c|f]ku\|\f1] \f2files\f1 | \f2resources\f1\|]  . . .
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4fuser\fP
outputs the process \s-1ID\s+1s of the processes
that are using the \f2files\fP or remote \f2resources\fP specified as arguments.
Each process \s-1ID\s+1 is followed by one of these letter codes, which identify
how the process is using the file:
.PP
.TP
\f4c\f1
as its current directory.
.TP
\f4r\f1
as its root directory, which was set up by the \f4chroot\fP(1M) command.
.TP
\f4o\f1
as an open file. 
.TP
\f4t\f1
as its text file. 
.TP
\f4a\f1
as its trace file located in the \f4/proc\fP directory.
.PP
For block special devices with mounted file systems, processes using
any file on that device are listed.  For remote resource names,
processes using any file associated with that remote resource (Remote File 
Sharing) are reported.   
For all other types of files (text files, executables, directories,
devices, etc.) only the processes using that file are reported.
.PP
The following options may be used with \f4fuser\fP:
.PP
.TP
\f4\-c\f1
may be used with files that are mount points for file
systems.  With that option the report is for use of the
mount point and any files within that mounted file system.
.TP
\f4\-f\f1
when this is used, the report is only for the named
file, not for files within a mounted file system.
.TP
\f4\-u\f1
the user login name, in parentheses,
also follows the process \s-1ID\s+1.
.TP
\f4\-k\f1
the SIGKILL
signal is sent to each process.  Since this option spawns kills
for each process, the kill messages may not show up immediately
[see 
\f4kill\fP(2)].
.PP
If more than one group of files are specified, the
options may be respecified for each additional group of files.
A lone dash cancels the options currently in force.
.PP
The process \s-1ID\s+1s are printed as a single line on the standard output,
separated by spaces and terminated with a single new line.
All other output is written on standard error.
.PP
Any user with permission to read \f4/dev/kmem\f1 and \f4/dev/mem\f1 can use
\f4fuser\f1.
Only the super-user can terminate another user's process
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
.TP
\f(CWfuser \-ku /dev/dsk/1s?\f1
if typed by a user with appropriate privileges, terminates all processes 
that are preventing disk drive one from being unmounted, listing the process 
ID and login name of each as it is killed.
.TP
\f(CWfuser \-u /etc/passwd\f1
lists process IDs and login names
of processes that have the password
file open.
.TP
\f(CWfuser \-ku /dev/dsk/1s? \-u /etc/passwd\f1
executes both of the above examples in a single command line.
.TP
\f(CWfuser \-cu /home\fP
if the /dev/dsk/c1d0s9 device is mounted on /home, lists process ID's 
and login names of processes that are using /dev/dsk/c1d0s9.
.SH FILES
.PD 0
.TP \w'/dev/kmem\ \ \ \ 'u
\f4/stand/unix\f1
for system namelist
.TP
\f4/dev/kmem\f1
for system image
.TP
\f4/dev/mem\f1
also for system image
.PD
.SH NOTE
If an RFS resource from a pre System V Release 4 server is mounted,
\f4fuser\f1 can only report on use of the whole file system, not on
individual files within it.
.P
Because \f4fuser\f1 works with a snapshot of the system image, it
may miss processes that begin using a file while \f4fuser\f1 is
running.  Also, processes reported as using a file may have 
stopped using it while \f4fuser\f1 was running.  These factors
should discourage the use of the \f4\-k\f1 option.
.P
\f4fuser\fP does not report all possible usages of a file (e.g. a mapped file).

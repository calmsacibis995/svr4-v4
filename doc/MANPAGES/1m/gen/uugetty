.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/usr/lib/uucp/uugetty\f1 [\f4\-t \f2timeout\f1] [\f4\-r\f1] \f2line\f1 [\f2speed\f1 [\f2type\f1 [\f2linedisc\f1] ] ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4uugetty\fP
is identical to \f4getty\fP(1M) but changes have been made to support
using the line for \f4uucico\fP, \f4cu\fP, and \f4ct\fP;
that is, the line can be used in both directions.
The \f4uugetty\fP allows users to login, but if the line is free,
\f4uucico\fP, \f4cu\fP, or \f4ct\fP can use it for dialing out.
The implementation depends on the fact that \f4uucico\fP, \f4cu\fP, and \f4ct\fP
create lock files when devices are used.
When the \f4open\fP returns
(or the first character is read when
\f4\-r\f1
option is used),
the status of the lock file indicates whether the line is being
used by \f4uucico\fP, \f4cu\fP, \f4ct\fP, or someone trying to login.
Note that in the
\f4\-r\f1
case, several
.SM RETURN
characters may be required before the
login message is output.
\f4uucico\f1 trying to login will have to be told by using the following
login script:
.PP
	\f4""  \\r\\d\\r\\d\\r\\d\\r in:--in: \f1. . .
.PP
where the ``. . .'' is whatever would normally be used for the login sequence.
.PP
If there is a
\f4uugetty\fP
on one end of a direct line,
there must be a
\f4uugetty\fP
on the other end as well.
Here is an \f4/etc/inittab\f1 entry using \f4uugetty\fP on an intelligent modem or
direct line:
.PP
	\f430:2:respawn:/usr/lib/uucp/uugetty \-r \-t 60 tty12 1200\fP
.PP
.PP
The meanings of the available options are
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
\f4\-t \f2timeout\f1
Specifies that \f4uugetty\fP should exit if the open on the line
succeeds and there is no response to the login prompt in \f2timeout\f1 seconds.
\f2timeout\f1 is replaced by an integer.
.TP
\f4\-r\fP
Causes \f4uugetty\fP to wait to read a character before it puts out the
login message, thus preventing two \f4uugetty\fPs from looping.
An entry for an intelligent modem or direct line that has a \f4uugetty\fP
on each end must use this option.
.TP
\f2line\fP
Defines the name of the line to which \f4uugetty\fP will attach itself.
The line name will point to an entry in the \f4/dev\f1 directory.
For example, \f4/dev/tty03\f1.
.TP
\f2speed\fP
Defines the entry to use from the \f4/usr/lib/saf/ttymondefs\f1 file.
The entry defines the line speed, the login message, the initial
tty setting, and the next speed to try if the user says the speed
is inappropriate (by sending a \f2break\f1 character).
The default \f2speed\f1 is 300.
.TP
\f2type\fP
Defines the type of terminal connected to the line.
The default terminal is \f4none\f1, representing a normal terminal
unknown to the system.
.TP
\f2linedisc\fP
Sets the line discipline to use on the line.
The default is \f4LDISC0\f1, which is the only one currently compiled
into the operating system.
.bp
.TP
\f4\-c \f2file\f1
Checks the speed and tty definitions in \f2file\f1 and sends the results
to standard output.
Unrecognized modes and improperly constructed entries are reported.
For correct entries, flag values are printed.
\f2file\f1 is replaced by \f4/usr/lib/saf/ttymondefs\f1 or a similarly structured
file.

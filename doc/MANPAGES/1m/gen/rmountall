.SH NAME
\f4rmountall\f1, \f4rumountall\f1 \- mount, unmount Remote File Sharing resources
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/usr/sbin/rmountall\f1 [\-] " \f2file-system-table\f1 " [...]
.br
\f4/usr/sbin/rumountall [ \-k ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4rmountall\f1 is a Remote File Sharing command used to mount 
remote resources according to a \f2file-system-table\f1.
(\f4/etc/vfstab\f1 is the recommended \f2file-system-table\f1.)
\f4rmountall\f1 also invokes the \f4rmnttry\f1 command,
which attempts to mount queued resources.
The special file name ``\f4\-\f1'' reads from the standard input.
.PP
\f4rumountall\f1 causes all mounted remote resources to be unmounted
and deletes all resources that were queued from
\f4rmount\f1.
The \f4\-k\f1 option sends a \f4SIGKILL\f1 signal, 
via \f4fuser\f1, to processes that have files open.
.PP
Only a privileged user can execute these commands.
.PP
The format of the \f2file-system-table\f1 is as follows:
.IP "column 1" 12
block special file name of file system
.IP "column 2"
file system name for \f4fsck\f1 (ignored)
.IP "column 3"
mount-point directory
.IP "column 4"
file system type (must be \f4rfs\f1)
.IP "column 5"
file system check option (ignored)
.IP "column 6"
automount option (must be \f4yes\f1)
.IP "column 7"
mount flags (\f4ro\f1 for read-only, \f4rw\f1 for read-write,
\f4\-\f1 for read-write)
.PP
Columns are separated by white space.
Lines beginning with a pound sign (\f4#\f1) are comments.
Empty lines are ignored.

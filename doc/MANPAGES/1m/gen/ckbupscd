.SH NAME
\f4ckbupscd\f1 \- check file system backup schedule
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4ckbupscd\f1 [ \f4\-m\f1 ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4ckbupscd\fP consults the file \f4/etc/bupsched\f1 and
prints the file system lists from lines with date and time 
specifications matching the current time.  If the \f4\-m\f1 flag is
present, an introductory message in the output is suppressed so that
only the file system lists are printed.
Entries in the \f4bupsched\f1 file are printed under the
control of \f4cron\f1.
.P
The file \f4bupsched\f1 should contain 
lines of four or more fields,
separated by spaces or tabs.
The first three fields (the schedule fields)
specify a range of dates and times.
The rest of the fields constitute 
a list of names of file systems to be printed 
if \f4ckbupscd\fP is run at some time within the range 
given by the schedule fields.
The general format is:
.P
.RS
.IR time  [,  time  ]
.IR day  [,  day  ]
.IR month  [,  month  "] "  fsyslist
.RE
.P
where:
.P
.TP 8
\f2time\f1
Specifies an hour of the day (\f40\f1 through \f423\f1), matching any
time within that hour, or an exact time of day (\f40:00\f1 through 
\f423:59\f1).
.P
.TP 8
\f2day\f1
Specifies a day of the week (\f4sun\f1 through \f4sat\f1) or day
of the month (\f41\f1 through \f431\f1).
.P
.TP 8
\f2month\f1
Specifies the month in which the time and day fields are valid.  Legal 
values are the month
numbers (\f41\f1 through \f412\f1).
.P
.TP 8
\f2fsyslist\f1
The rest of the line is taken to be a file system list to print.
.P
Multiple time, day, and month specifications may be separated by
commas, in which case they are evaluated left to right.  
.P
An asterisk (\f4*\f1) always matches the current value for the field
in which it appears.
.P
A line beginning with a sharp sign (\f4#\f1) is interpreted as a
comment and ignored.  
.P
The longest line allowed (including continuations) is 1024 characters.

The following are examples of lines which could appear in the 
\f4/etc/bupsched\f1 file.

.SH NAME
\f4mountfsys\f1, \f4umountfsys\f1 \- mount, unmount a file system
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4mountfsys\fP
.br
\f4umountfsys\fP
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4mountfsys\fP command mounts a file system
so that users can read from it and write to it.
The \f4umountfsys\fP command unmounts the file system.
.P
The command invokes a visual interface (the 
\f4mount\fP or \f4unmount\f1 tasks
available through the \f4sysadm\f1 command).
.P
The initial prompt for both commands allows you to
select the device on which
to mount/unmount the file system.
.P
For the \f4mountfsys\fP command, you are asked to select
how the file system is to be mounted; for example, read-only or read/write.
.P
The identical functions are available under the \f4sysadm\fP menu:
.P
.RS
\f4sysadm mount\f1
.sp .5
\f4sysadm unmount\f1
.RE
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Both \f4mountfsys\f1 and \f4umountfsys\f1 exit with one
of the following values:
.TP
\f40\f1
Normal exit.
.TP
\f42\f1
Invalid command syntax.
A usage message is displayed.
.TP
\f47\f1
The visual interface for this
command is not available because it cannot invoke \f4fmli\fP.
(The fmli package is not installed or is corrupt.)
.SH NOTES
For a removable medium,
once the disk is mounted it must not be removed from the disk drive
until it has been unmounted.
Removing the disk while it is still mounted can cause severe damage
to the data on the disk.

.SH NAME
\f4mount\f1 (s5) \- mount an \f4s5\f1 file system
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4mount\f1 [\f4\-F s5\f1]
[\f2generic_options\f1]
[\f4\-r\f1] [\f4\-o\f2 specific_options\f1] {\f2special | mount_point\f1}
\f4mount\f1 [\f4\-F s5\f1]
[\f2generic_options\f1]
[\f4\-r\f1] [\f4\-o\f2 specific_options\f1] \f2special  mount_point\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I generic_options
are options supported by the generic \f4mount\f1 command.
.PP
\f4mount\f1 notifies the system that \f2special\f1,
an \f4s5\f1 block special device, is available to users
from the \f2mount_point\f1 which must exist before \f4mount\f1 is called;
it becomes the name of the root of the newly mounted \f2special\f1.
.PP
The options are:
.TP 10
\f4\-F s5\f1
Specify an \f4s5\f1 FSType.
.TP 10
\f4\-r\f1 
Mount the file system read-only.
.TP 10
\f4\-o\f1 
Specify \f4s5\f1 file-specific options in a comma-separated list.
The avilable options are:
.RS 10
.TP 10
\f4rw\f1 | \f4ro\f1 
Read/write or read-only. Default is \f4rw\f1.
.TP 10
\f4suid\f1 | \f4nosuid\f1 
Setuid is honored or ignored on execution
Default is \f4suid\f1.
.sp 0.5
Note that a \f4mount\fP of an unprotected medium (such as a floppy disk)
introduces possible security risks.
While the use of \f4nosuid\fP protects against some risks, it is not
completely effective.
The best defense against such security risks is to avoid mounting 
unprotected media.
.TP 10
\f4remount\f1 
Used in conjunction with \f4rw\f1. A file system 
mounted read-only can be \f2remounted\f1 read-write. Fails if the
file system is not currently mounted
or if the file system is mounted \f4rw\f1.
Option is in force only when specified.
.RE
.PP
Only a privileged user can mount file systems.

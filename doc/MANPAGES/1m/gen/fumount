.SH NAME
\f4fumount\f1 \- forced unmount of advertised resources
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4fumount\f1
[-w \f2sec\f1] \f2resource\f1 [[-w \f2sec\fP] \f2resource\fP]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4fumount\f1 unadvertises each \f2resource\f1 and disconnects 
remote access to the \f2resource\fP. 
The \f4-w \f2sec\f1 causes a delay of \f2sec\f1 seconds 
prior to the disconnect from the \f2resource\fP specified immediately 
after the \f4\-w\fP. 
.P
When the forced unmount occurs, an administrative shell script
is started on each remote computer that has the resource mounted
(\f4/usr/bin/rfuadmin\f1).  If a grace period of several seconds is specified with \f4\-w\fP,
\f4rfuadmin\f1 is started with the \f4fuwarn\f1 option.
When the actual forced unmount is ready to occur, \f4rfuadmin\f1 is started
with the \f4fumount\f1 option. 
See the \f4rfuadmin\f1(1M) manual page
for information on the action taken in response to the forced unmount.
.P
This command is restricted to the super-user.
.SH ERRORS
If \f2resource\f1 (1) does not physically reside on the local machine, (2) is
an invalid resource name, (3) is not currently advertised and is not
remotely mounted, or (4)
the command is not run with super-user privileges, an error
message will be sent to standard error.

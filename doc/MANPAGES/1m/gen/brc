.SH NAME
\f4brc\f1, \f4bcheckrc\f1 \- system initialization procedures
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/sbin/brc\f1
.PP
\f4/sbin/bcheckrc\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
These shell procedures are executed via
entries in \f4/etc/inittab\f1
by \f4init\f1 whenever the system is booted.
.PP
First, the \f4bcheckrc\f1
procedure checks the status of the root file system.
If the root file system is found to be bad,
\f4bcheckrc\f1 repairs it.
.PP
Then, \f4bckeckrc\f1 mounts the \f4/stand\f1, \f4/proc\f1, and
\f4/var\f1 (if it exists) file systems (\f4/var\f1 may exist as a
directory in the root file system, or as a separate file system).
.PP
The \f4brc\f1 script performs administrative tasks related to file
sharing.
.PP
After these two procedures have executed, \f4init\f1
checks for the \f4initdefault\f1 value in \f4/etc/inittab\f1.
This tells \f4init\f1 in which run level to place the system.
If, for example, \f4initdefault\f1 is set to \f42\f1,
the system will be placed in the multi-user state via the
\f4rc2\f1 procedure.
.PP
Note that \f4bcheckrc\f1 should always be executed before \f4brc\f1.
Also, these shell procedures may be used for several run-level states.

.SH NAME
\f4migration\f1 \- move an archive from one set of volumes to another
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\f4migration -B \f1[ \f4-dlmotuvAENS \f1] \f2bkjobid ofsname ofsdev ofslab descript\f1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4migration\fP
is invoked as a child process by
\f4bkdaemon\f1(1M)
to move an existing archive made by some other arbitrary
method to a new set of volumes.
The existing backup history log entry of the archive is updated
to reflect the new volumes and destination information of
the archive.
.P
.I bkjobid
is the job id assigned by
\f4backup\f1(1M).
\f2ofsdev\f1
is the name of the UNIX
raw (character) device on which the archive resides.
.I ofslab
is the volume label on the archive [see \f4labelit\f1(1M)].
.I descript
is a description for a destination device in the form:
.P
.RS
\f2dgroup:dname:dchar:dlabels\f1
.RE
.P
.I dgroup 
specifies a device group.
\f4dname\fP
specifies a device name.
.I dchars
specifies characteristics for the specified
device and group (see \f4device.tab\f1(4)
for a further description of device characteristics).
.I dlabels
specifies the media names for the media to be used
for the archive.
.SS Options
.TP
\f4d*\f1
Do not update the backup history log entry for the archive.
.TP
\f4l*\f1
Create a long form of the backup history log that includes a table-of-contents
for the archive.
This includes the data used to generate an
.IR "ls -l" -like
listing of each file in the archive.
.TP
\f4m*\f1
Mount the originating filesystem read-only before starting the backup
and remount it with its original permissions after completing the backup.
.TP
\f4o\f1
Permit the user to override media insertion requests (see 
\f4getvol\f1(1M) \f4-o\f1).
.TP
\f4t*\f1
Create a table of contents for the backup on additional media instead
of in the backup history log.
.TP
\f4u*\f1
Unmount the originating filesystem before performing the backup
and remount it with its original permissions after completing the backup.
.TP
\f4v*\f1
Validate the archive as it is written.
A checksum is computed as the archive is being written;
as each medium is completed, it is re-read and the checksum recomputed
to verify that each block is readable and correct.
If either check fails, the medium is considered unreadable.
If
\f4-A \f1
has been specified,
the archiving operation fails;
otherwise, the operator is prompted to replace the failed medium.
.TP
\f4A\f1
Do not prompt the user for removable media operations (automated operation).
.TP
\f4E*\f1
Report an estimate of media usage for the archive;
then perform the backup.
.TP
\f4N*\f1
Report an estimate of media usage for the archive;
do not perform the backup.
.TP
\f4S*\f1
Generate a period (.) for every 100 (512 byte) blocks read-from or
written-to the archive on the destination device.
.SS User Interactions
The connection between an archiving method and
\f4backup\f1(1M)
is more complex than a simple fork/exec or pipe.
\f4backup\f1(1M)
is responsible for all interactions with the user, either directly,
or through
\f4bkoper\f1(1M).
Therefore,
\f4migration\f1
neither reads from standard-input nor writes to standard-output or 
standard-error.
A method library must be used [see
\f4libbrmeth\f1(3)]
to communicate reports
(estimates, periods, status, etc.) to
\f4backup(1M)\f1.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
If 
\f4migration\f1
successfully completes its task, it
exits with a 0 status.
If any of the parameters
to
\f4migration\f1
are invalid,
it exits with a 1 status.
If any error occurs which causes
\f4migration\f1
to fail to complete
.I all
portions of its task,
it exits with a 2 status.

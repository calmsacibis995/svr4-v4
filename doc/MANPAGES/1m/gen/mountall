.SH NAME
\f4mountall, umountall\f1 \- mount, unmount multiple file systems 
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4mountall\f1  [\f4\-F\f2 FSType\f1] [\f4\-l\f1 | \f4\-r\f1] [ \f2file_system_table\f1]
.br
\f4umountall\f1 [\f4\-F\f2 FSType\f1] [\f4\-k\f1] [\f4\-l\f1 | \f4\-r\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
These commands may be executed only
by a privileged user.
.PP
\f4mountall \f1 is used to mount file systems according
to a \f2file_system_table\f1. (\f4/etc/vfstab\f1 is the
default file system table.) The special file name "\-"
reads from the standard input.
If the dash is specified, then the standard input
must be in the same format as \f4/etc/vfstab\f1.
With no arguments \f4mountall\f1 restricts 
the mount to all systems with \f4automnt\f1 field set to \f4yes\f1 in
the \f2file_system_table\f1. 
.PP
Before each file system is mounted, a sanity check is done 
using \f4fsck\f1 [see \f4fsck(1M)\f1] to see if it appears mountable.
If the file system does not appear mountable, it is fixed,
using \f4fsck\f1, before the mount is attempted.
.PP
\f4umountall\fP
causes all mounted file systems except \f4root\fP,
\f4/proc\fP, \f4/stand\fP, and \f4/dev/fd\fP 
to be unmounted.
If the \f2FSType\f1 is specified \f4mountall\f1 and
\f4umountall\f1 limit their actions to the \f2FSType\f1 specified.
.PP
The options are:
.TP 10
\f4\-F\fP
Specify the File System type  to be mounted or unmounted. If
\f2FSType\f1 is specified the action is limited to file systems
of this \f2FSType\f1.
.TP 10
\f4\-l\fP
Limit the action to local file systems.
.TP 10
\f4\-r\fP
Limit the action to remote file system types.
.TP 10
\f4\-k\fP
Send a \f2SIGKILL\f1 signal to processes that have files opened.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
No messages are printed if the file systems are mountable and clean.
.PP
Error and warning messages come from
\f4fsck\f1(1M)
and
\f4mount\f1(1M).

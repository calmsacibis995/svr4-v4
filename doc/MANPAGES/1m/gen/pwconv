.SH NAME
\f4pwconv\f1 \- install and update \f4/etc/shadow\f1 with information from \f4/etc/passwd\f1
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4pwconv\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4pwconv\fP command
creates and updates 
\f4/etc/shadow\f1
with information from 
\f4/etc/passwd\f1.
.PP
If the
\f4/etc/shadow\f1
file does not exist,
\f4pwconv\fP creates 
\f4/etc/shadow\f1
with information from
\f4/etc/passwd\f1.
The command populates 
\f4/etc/shadow\f1
with the user's login name, password, and password aging information.
If 
password aging information does not exist in 
\f4/etc/passwd\f1
for a given user, none is added to 
\f4/etc/shadow\f1.
However, the last changed information is
always updated.
.PP
If the 
\f4/etc/shadow\f1
file does exist, the following tasks are performed:
.IP
Entries that are in the 
\f4/etc/passwd\f1
file and not in the
\f4/etc/shadow\f1
file are added to the \f4/etc/shadow\f1 file.
.IP
Entries that are in the 
\f4/etc/shadow\f1
file and not in the
\f4/etc/passwd\f1
file are removed from \f4/etc/shadow\f1.
.IP
Password attributes (for example, password and aging information) 
in an
\f4/etc/passwd\f1
entry are moved to the corresponding entry in 
\f4/etc/shadow.\f1
.PP
The \f4pwconv\fP program
is a privileged system command that cannot be executed by ordinary users.

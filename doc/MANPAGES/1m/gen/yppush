.SH NAME
\f4yppush\fP \- force propagation of a changed NIS map
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/usr/sbin/yppush\f1
[

\f2mapname\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\f4yppush\f1
copies a new version of the NIS
name service map from the master
\s-1NIS\s0
server to the slave
\s-1NIS\s0
servers.
It is normally run only on the master
\s-1NIS\s0
server by the
\f4Makefile\f1
in
\f4/var/yp\f1
after the master databases are changed.
It first constructs a list of
\s-1NIS\s0
server hosts by reading the
\s-1NIS\s0
map
\f4ypservers\f1
within the
\f2ypdomain\f1,
or if the map is not set up,
the local file is used.
Keys within the map
\f4ypservers\f1
are the
\s-1ASCII\s0
names of the machines on which the
\s-1NIS\s0
servers run.
.P
A \(lqtransfer map\(rq request is sent to the
\s-1NIS\s0
server at each host,
along with the information needed by the transfer agent (the program
that actually moves the map) to call back the
\f4yppush\f1.
When the attempt has completed (successfully
or not), and the transfer agent has sent
\f4yppush\f1
a status message, the results may be printed to stdout. 
Messages
are also printed when a transfer is not possible; for
instance when the request message is
undeliverable, or when the timeout period
on responses has expired.
.P
Refer to
\f4ypfiles\f1(4)
and
\f4ypserv\f1(1M)
for an overview of the NIS name service.
.P
The following options are available:
.TP 16
\f4\-v\f1
Verbose.
Print messages when each server is called,
and for each response.
If this flag is omitted, only error messages are printed.
.TP
\f4\-d \f2ypdomain\f1
Specify a
\f2ypdomain \f1
other than the default domain.

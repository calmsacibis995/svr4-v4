.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4prfld\f1,
\f4prfstat\fP,
\f4prfdc\fP,
\f4prfsnap\fP,
and
\f4prfpr\fP
form a system of programs
to facilitate an activity study of the
.SM UNIX
operating system.
.PP
\f4prfld\f1
is used to initialize the recording
mechanism in the system.
It generates a table
containing the starting address of each
system subroutine as extracted from
.IR system_namelist .
.PP
\f4prfstat\f1
is used to enable or disable the sampling mechanism.
Profiler overhead is less than 1% as calculated
for 500 text addresses.
\f4prfstat\f1
will also reveal the number of
text addresses
being measured.
.PP
\f4prfdc\f1
and
\f4prfsnap\fP
perform the data collection function of the profiler
by copying the current value of all the text address counters
to a file where the data can be analyzed.
\f4prfdc\f1
will store the counters into
.I file\^
every
.I period\^
minutes and will turn off at
.I off_hour
(valid values for
.I off_hour
are
\f40\f1\-\f424\f1).
\f4prfsnap\f1
collects data at the time of invocation only,
appending the counter values to
.IR file .
.PP
\f4prfpr\f1
formats the data collected by
\f4prfdc\fP
or
\f4prfsnap\fP.
Each text address is converted to the nearest text symbol
(as found in
.IR system_namelist )
and is printed if the percent activity
for that range is greater than
.IR cutoff .

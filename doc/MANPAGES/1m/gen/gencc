.SH NAME
\f4gencc\f1 \- create a front-end to the \f4cc\f1 command
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4gencc\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\f4gencc\fP command is an interactive command designed to aid in the creation of
a front-end to the \f4cc\fP command.
Since hard-coded pathnames have been 
eliminated from the C Compilation System (CCS), it is possible to move
pieces of the CCS to new locations without recompilation.
The new
locations of moved pieces can be specified through the \f4\-Y\f1 option to 
the \f4cc\fP command.
However, it is inconvenient to supply the proper 
\f4\-Y\f1 options with every invocation of the \f4cc\fP command.
Further,
if a system administrator moves pieces of the CCS, such movement should be
invisible to users.
.PP
The front-end to the \f4cc\fP command that \f4gencc\fP generates is 
a one-line shell script that calls the \f4cc\fP command with the proper
\f4\-Y\f1 options specified.
The front-end to the \f4cc\fP command will
also pass all user-supplied options to the \f4cc\fP command.
.PP
\f4gencc\fP prompts for the location of each tool and directory
that can be respecified by a \f4\-Y\f1 option to the \f4cc\fP command.
If no location is specified, it assumes that that piece of
the CCS has not been relocated.
After all the locations have been prompted for,
\f4gencc\fP will create the front-end to the \f4cc\fP command.
.PP
\f4gencc\fP
creates the front-end to the \f4cc\fP command in the current working 
directory and gives the file the same name as the \f4cc\fP command.
Thus, \f4gencc\fP can not be run in the same directory containing
the actual \f4cc\fP command.
Further, if a system administrator has
redistributed the CCS, the actual \f4cc\fP command should be placed
in a location that is not typically in a user's path (e.g., \f4/usr/lib\f1).
Such
placement will prevent users from accidentally
invoking the \f4cc\fP command without using the front-end.
.SH "NOTES"
\f4gencc\fP does not produce any warnings if a tool or directory does not exist
at the specified location.
Also, \f4gencc\fP does not actually move any files
to new locations.
.SP
The \f4gencc\fP command is obsolete.

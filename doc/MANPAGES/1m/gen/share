.SH NAME
\f4share\f1 \- make local resource available for mounting by remote systems
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4share\f1
[\f4\-F \f2fstype\f1]
[\f4\-o \f2specific_options\f1]
[\f4\-d \f2description\f1]
[\f2pathname \f1[\f2resourcename\f1]]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\f4share\f1
command makes a resource available for mounting through a remote file
system of type \f2fstype\f1.  If the option \f4\-F\f1 \f2fstype\f1 
is omitted, the
first file system type listed in file \f4/etc/dfs/fstypes\f1 will
be used as the default.
\f2Specific_options\f1 as well as the
semantics of \f2resourcename\f1 are specific to particular distributed
file systems.  When invoked with only a file system type, \f4share\f1
displays all resources shared by the given file system to the local
system.  When invoked with no arguments, \f4share\f1 displays
all resources shared by the local system.
.P
The \f2access_spec\f1 is used to control access of the shared resource.
It may be one of the following:
.RS 5
.IP \f4rw\f1 15
\f2pathname\f1 is shared read/write to all clients.
This is also the default behavior.
.IP \f4rw=\f1\f2client\f1[\f2:client\f1]... 15
\f2pathname\f1 is shared read/write only to the
listed clients.
No other systems can
access \f2resourcename\f1.
.IP \f4ro\f1 15
\f2pathname\f1 is shared read-only to all clients.
.IP \f4ro=\f1\f2client\f1[\f2:client\f1]... 15
\f2pathname\f1 is shared read-only only to the
listed clients.  
No other systems can access \f2pathname\f1.
.RE
.P
The \f4\-d\f1 flag may be used to provide a description of the
resource being shared.

.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4putdev\f1
can add a new device to the device table, modify an existing device
description or remove a device entry from the table.
The first synopsis is used to add a device.
The second synopsis is used to modify existing entries
by adding or changing attributes.
If a specified attribute is not defined,
this option adds that attribute to the device definition.
If it is already
defined, it modifies the attribute definition.
The third synopsis is used to delete either an entire device entry or,
if the attribute argument is used, to
delete an attribute assignment for a device.
.P
The options and arguments for this command are:
.TP 10
\f4-a \f1
Adds a device to the device table using the specified attributes.
The device must be referenced by its \f2alias\f1.
.TP 10
\f4-m\f1
Modifies a device entry in the device table.
If an entry already exists, it
adds any specified attributes that are not defined.
It also modifies any
attributes which already have a value 
with the value specified with this command.
.TP 10
\f4-d\f1
Removes a device from the device table,
when executed without the \f2attributes\f1 argument.
Used with the \f2attribute\f1 argument, it deletes the given attribute
specification for \f2device\f1 from the table.
.TP 10
\f2alias\f1
Designates the alias of the device to be added.
.TP 10
\f2device\f1
Designates the pathname or alias of the device 
whose attribute is to be added, modified, or removed.
.TP 10
\f2attribute\f1
Designates a device attribute to be added or modified.
Can be any of the device attributes described under NOTES except alias.
This prevents an accidental modification or deletion
of a device's alias from the table.
.TP 10
\f2value\f1
Designates the value to be assigned to a device's attribute.
.SH NOTES
The following list shows all of the attributes which can be defined for a
device:
.TP 15
\f4alias\f1
The unique name by which a device is known.
No two devices in the database may
share the same alias name.
The name is limited in length to 14 characters and
should contain only alphanumeric
characters and also the following special characters
if they are escaped with a backslash:  underscore (_), dollar sign ($),
hyphen (-), and period (.).
.TP 15
\f4bdevice\f1
The pathname to the block special device node
associated with the device, if any.
The associated major/minor combination should be unique within the database
and should match that associated with the \f4cdevice\f1 field, if any.
(It is the administrator's responsibility to ensure
that these \f4major/minor\f1 numbers
are unique in the database.)
.TP 15
\f4capacity\f1
The capacity of the device or of the typical volume, if removable.
.TP 15
\f4cdevice\f1
The pathname to the character special device node associated with the device,
if any.
The associated major/minor combination should
be unique within the database
and should match that associated with the \f4bdevice\f1 field, if any.
(It is the administrator's responsibility to ensure
that these \f4major/minor\f1 numbers
are unique in the database.)
.TP 15
\f4cyl\f1
Used by the command specified in the \f4mkfscmd\f1 attribute.
.TP 15
\f4desc\f1
A description of any instance of a volume associated with this device
(such as floppy diskette).
.TP 15
\f4dpartlist\f1
The list of disk partitions associated with this device.
Used only if \f4type=disk\f1.
The list should contain device aliases, each of which must have
\f4type=dpart\f1.
.TP 15
\f4dparttype\f1
The type of disk partition represented by this device.
Used only if \f4type=dpart\f1.
It should be either \f4fs\f1 (for filesystem) or \f4dp\f1 (for data
partition).
.TP 15
\f4erasecmd\f1
The command string that, when executed, erases the device.
.TP 15
\f4fmtcmd\f1
The command string that, when executed, formats the device.
.TP 15
\f4fsname\f1
The filesystem name on the file system administered on this
partition, as supplied to the
\f4/usr/sbin/labelit\f1 command.
This attribute is specified only if \f4type=dpart\f1 and
\f4dparttype=fs\f1.
.TP 15
\f4gap\f1
Used by the command specified in the \f4mkfscmd\f1 attribute.
.TP 15
\f4mkfscmd\f1
The command string that, when executed, places a file system on a previously
formatted device.
.TP 15
\f4mountpt\f1
The default mount point to use for the device.
Used only if the device is mountable.
For disk partitions where \f4type=dpart\f1 and \f4dparttype=fs\f1, this
attribute should specify the location where the partition is normally mounted.
.TP 15
\f4nblocks\f1
The number of blocks in the filesystem administered on this partition.
Used only if \f4type=dpart\f1 and \f4dparttype=fs\f1.
.TP 15
\f4ninodes\f1
The number of inodes in the filesystem administered on this partition.
Used only if \f4type=dpart\f1 and \f4dparttype=fs\f1.
.TP 15
\f4norewind\f1
The name of the character special device node that allows access to the serial
device without rewinding when the device is closed.
.TP 15
\f4pathname\f1
Defines the pathname to an
i-node describing the device (used for non-block or character device
pathnames, such as directories).
.TP 15
\f4type\f1
A token that represents inherent qualities of the device.
Standard types
include: 9-track, ctape, disk, directory, diskette, dpart, and qtape.
.TP 15
\f4volname\f1
The volume name on the filesystem administered on this partition, as supplied to
the \f4/usr/sbin/labelit\f1 command.
Used only if \f4type=dpart\f1 and \f4dparttype=fs\f1.
.TP 15
\f4volume\f1
A text string used to describe any instance of a volume associated with this
device.
This attribute should not be defined for devices which are not
removable.
.SH ERRORS
The command will exit with one of the following values:
.TP 4
\f40\f1 =
successful completion of the task.
.P
.TP 4
\f41\f1 =
command syntax incorrect,
invalid option used, or internal error occurred.
.P
.TP 4
\f42\f1 =
device table could not be opened for reading
or new device table could not be created.
.P
.TP 4
\f43\f1 =
if executed with the \f4-a\f1 option, indicates that an
entry in the device table
with the alias \f2alias\f1 already exits.
If executed with the \f4-m\f1 or \f4-d\f1 options,
indicates that no entry exists for device \f2device\f1.
.P
.TP 4
\f44\f1 =
indicates that \f4-d\f1 was requested and one
or more of the specified
attributes were not defined for the device.

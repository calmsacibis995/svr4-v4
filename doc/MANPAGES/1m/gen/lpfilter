.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4lpfilter\fP command is used to add, change,
delete, and list a filter used with the \s-1LP\s+1 print
service.
These filters are used to convert the content type
of a file to a content type acceptable to a 
printer.
One of the following options must be used with the
\f4lpfilter\fP command:
\f4\-F\ \f2path-name\f1 (or \f4\-\f1 for standard input)
to add or change a filter;
\f4\-i\f1 to reset an original filter to its factory setting;
\f4\-x\f1 to delete a filter;
or \f4\-l\f1 to list a filter description.
.PP
The argument \f4all\f1 can be used instead of a \f2filter-name\f1
with any of these options.
When \f4all\f1 is specified with the \f4\-F\f1 or \f4\-\f1
option, the requested change is made to all filters.
Using \f4all\f1 with the \f4\-i\f1 option
has the effect of restoring to their original settings 
all filters for which predefined settings
were initially available.
Using the \f4all\f1 argument 
with the \f4\-x\f1 option
results in all filters being deleted,
and using it with the \f4\-l\f1 option 
produces a list of all filters.
.SS "Adding or Changing a Filter"
The filter named in the
\f4\-f\f1
option is added to the filter table.
If the filter already exists,
its description is changed to reflect the new information in
the input.
.P
The filter description is taken from the
.I "path-name"
if the
\f4\-F\f1
option is given,
or from the standard input if the
\f4\-\f1
option is given.
One of the two must be given to define or change a filter.
If the filter named is one originally delivered with the LP
print service,
the
\f4\-i\f1
option will restore the original filter description.
.iE
.dH "DEFAULT"
.P
When an existing filter is changed with the \f4\-F\f1
or \f4\-\f1 option,
items that are not specified in the new information
are left as they were.
When a new filter is added with this command,
unspecified items are given default values.
(See below.)
.P
Filters are used to convert the content of a request into a
data stream acceptable to a printer.
For a given print request,
the LP print service will know the following:
.DL 5 1
.LI
the type of content in the request,
.LI
the name of the printer,
.LI
the type of the printer,
.LI
the types of content acceptable to the printer, and
.LI
the modes of printing asked for by the originator of the
request.
.LE 1
It will use this information to find a filter 
or a pipeline of filters
that will convert
the content into a type acceptable to the printer.
.P
Below is a list of items 
that provide input to this command,
and a description of each item.
All lists are comma or space separated.

\f4Input types\f1
This gives the types of content that can be accepted by the
filter.
(The default is \f4any\fP.)
.TP
\f4Output types\f1
This gives the types of content that the filter can produce
from any of the input content types.
(The default is \f4any\fP.)
.TP
\f4Printer types\f1
This gives the type of printers for which the filter can be
used.
The \s-1LP\s+1 print service will restrict the use of the filter
to these types of printers.
(The default is \f4any\fP.)
.TP
\f4Printers\f1
This gives the names of the printers for which the filter can
be used.
The \s-1LP\s+1 print service will restrict the use of the filter to just the
printers named.
(The default is \f4any\fP.)
.TP
\f4Filter type\f1
This marks the filter as 
a \f4slow\fP filter or a \f4fast\fP filter.
Slow filters are generally those that take a long time to
convert their input.
They are run unconnected to a printer,
to keep the printers from being tied up 
while the filter is running.
If a listed printer is on a remote system,
the filter type for it must have the value \f4slow\fP.
Fast filters are generally those 
that convert their input quickly,
or those that must be connected to the printer when run.
These will be given to the interface program
.cX IP
to run connected to the physical printer.
.TP
\f4Command\f1
This specifies the program to run to invoke the filter.
The full program pathname as well as fixed options must 
be included in the
.IR "shell-command" ;
additional options are constructed, based on the characteristics of
each print request and on the
\f4Options\f1
field.
A command must be given for each filter.
.sp .5
The command must accept a data stream as standard input and
produce the converted data stream on its standard output.
This allows filter pipelines to be constructed to convert data
not handled by a single filter.
.TP
\f4Options\f1
This is a comma separated list of templates
used by the \s-1LP\s+1 print service to construct
options to the filter from the characteristics of each print
request listed in the table later.
.sp .5
In general, each template is of the following form:
.sp .5
\0\0\0\f2keyword pattern \f4=\f2 replacement\f1
.sp .5
The
.I "keyword"
names the characteristic that the template attempts to map into
a filter specific option;
each valid
.I "keyword"
is listed in the table below.
A
.I "pattern"
is one of the following: 
a literal pattern of one of the forms listed in the table,
a single asterisk (\f4*\f1),
or a regular expression.
If \f2pattern\fP matches 
the value of the characteristic,
the template fits and is used 
to generate a filter specific option.
The \f2replacement\fP is
what will be used as the option.
.P
Regular expressions are the same as those
found in the \f4ed\fP(1) or \f4vi\fP(1) commands.
This includes the \f4\e(\f1...\f4\e)\fP and \f4\e\f2n\f1 constructions,
which can be used to extract portions of the \f2pattern\f1
for copying into the \f2replacement\f1, and the \f4&\f1,
which can be used to copy the entire \f2pattern\f1 into the
\f2replacement\f1.
.PP
The \f2replacement\fP can also contain a \f4*\fP;
it too, is replaced with the entire \f2pattern\f1,
just like the \f4&\fP of \f4ed\fP(1).

.PP
For example, the template
.sp .5
.in +2m
\f4MODES landscape = \-l
.ft P
.sp .5
.in -2m
shows that if a print request is submitted with
the \f4\-y landscape\f1 option,
the filter will be given the option \f4\-l\f1.
As another example,
the template
.sp .5
.in +2m
\f4TERM * = \-T *\f1
.sp .5
.in -2m
shows that the filter will be given the option
\f4\-T \f2printer-type\f1
for whichever \f2printer-type\f1
is associated with a print request using the filter.
.P
As a last example, consider the template
.sp .5
.in +2m
\f4MODES prwidth\e=\e(.\(**\e) = \-w\e1\f1
.sp .5
.in -2m
.P
Suppose a user gives the command
.sp .5
.in +2m
\f4lp \-y prwidth=10\fP
.sp .5
.in -2m
.P
From the table above,
the \s-1LP\s+1 print service
determines that the \f4\-y\fP option
is handled by a \f4MODES\fP
template.
The \f4MODES\fP template
here works because the \f2pattern\fP
\f4prwidth\e=\e(.*\e)\fP
matches the \f4prwidth=10\fP
given by the user.
The \f2replacement\fP
\f4\-w\e1\fP
causes the \s-1LP\s+1 print service
to generate the filter option \f4\-w10\fP.
.PP
If necessary, the \s-1LP\s+1 print service
will construct a filter
pipeline by concatenating several filters to handle
the user's file and all the print options.
(See \f4sh\fP(1) for a description of a pipeline.)
If the print service constructs a filter pipeline,
the \f4INPUT\fP and \f4OUTPUT\fP values 
used for each filter in the pipeline
are the types of the input and output
for that filter, not for the entire pipeline.
.SS "Deleting a Filter"
The
\f4\-x\f1
option is used to delete the filter specified in
\f2filter-name\f1 from the 
.SM LP
filter table.
.SS "Listing a Filter Description"
The
\f4\-l\f1
option is used to list the description of the filter
named in \f2filter-name\f1.
If the command is successful,
the following message is sent to standard output:
.P

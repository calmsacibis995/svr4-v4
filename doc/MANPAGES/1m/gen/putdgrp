.SH NAME
\f4putdgrp\f1 \- edits device group table
.SH SYNOPSIS
.ft CW
putdgrp \f1[\f4\-d\f1] \f2dgroup \f1[\f2device \f1[\f4...\f1]\|]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4putdgrp\f1
modifies the device group table.
It performs two kinds of modification.
It can modify the table 
by creating a new device group or removing a device group.
It can also change group definitions by 
adding or removing a device from the group definition.
.P
When the command is invoked with only a \f2dgroup\f1 specification, the command
adds the specified group name to the device group table if it does not already
exist.
If the \f4-d\f1 option is
also used with only the \f2dgroup\f1 specification, the command
deletes the group from the table. 
.P
When the command is invoked with both a \f2dgroup\f1 and a \f2device\f1
specification, it adds the given device name (or names) to the group definition.
When invoked with both arguments and the \f4-d\f1 option, the command
deletes the device name (or names) from the group definition.
.P
When the command is invoked with both a \f2dgroup\f1 and a \f2device\f1
specification and the device group does not exist, it creates the group and
adds the specified devices to that new group.
.P
The options and arguments for this command are:
.TP 10
\f4-d\f1
Deletes the group or, if used with \f2device\f1, the device 
from a group definition.
.TP 10
\f2dgroup\f1
Specifies a device group name.
.TP 10
\f2device\f1
Specifies the pathname or alias of the device that is to added to or deleted
from the device group.
.SH ERRORS
The command will exit with one of the following values:
.TP 4
\f40\f1 =
successful completion of the task.
.TP 4
\f41\f1 =
command syntax incorrect, invalid option used, or internal error occurred.
.TP 4
\f42\f1 =
device group table could not be opened for reading or a new device group table
could not be created.
.TP 4
\f43\f1 =
if executed with the \f4-d\f1 option, indicates that an entry in the device
group table for the device group \f2dgroup\f1 does not exist and so cannot be
deleted.
Otherwise, indicates that the 
device group \f2dgroup\f1 already exists and cannot be added.
.TP 4
\f44\f1 =
if executed with the \f4-d\f1 option, indicates that the device group
\f2dgroup\f1 does not have as members one or more of the specified devices.
Otherwise, indicates that the device group \f2dgroup\f1 already has one or more
of the specified devices as members.

.SH NAME
\f4rmnttry\f1 \- attempt to mount queued remote resources
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/etc/rfs/rmnttry\f1 [\f2resource\f1 ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4rmnttry\f1 sequences through the pending mount requests stored
in \f4/etc/rfs/rmnttab\f1, trying to mount each resource.  If
a mount succeeds, the resource entry is removed from the
\f4/etc/rfs/rmnttab\f1 file.
.P
If one or more resource names are supplied, mounts are attempted
only for those resources, rather than for all pending mounts.
Mounts are not attempted for resources not present in the
\f4/etc/rfs/rmnttab\f1 file (see \f4rmount\f1\s-1(1M)\s+1).
If a mount invoked from \f4rmnttry\f1 takes over 3 minutes to
complete, \f4rmnttry\f1 aborts the mount and issues a warning
message.
.P
\f4rmnttry\f1 is typically invoked from a cron entry in \f4/var/spool/cron/crontabs/root\f1
to attempt mounting queued resources at periodic intervals.  The default
strategy is to attempt mounts at 15 minute intervals.  The cron entry for this
is:

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
An exit code of 0 is returned if all requested mounts succeeded, 1 is
returned if one or more mounts failed, and 2 is returned for bad usage.

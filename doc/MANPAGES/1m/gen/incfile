.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4incfile\fP is invoked as a child process by other
shell commands.
The command name, \f4incfile\fP, is read either from the
\f4bkhist.tab\f1 file or the \f4bkreg \-m\f1 command and option.
The \f4 \-B, \-T, \-R, \-F, \f1and \f4\-C \f1options
are passed to \f4incfile\fP by
the shell commands \f4backup, restore,\f1
and \f2urestore(1)\f1 described below.
The minus options are passed from the
\f4bkhist.tab\f1 file or the \f4bkreg \-p\f1 command and option.
The arguments are sent to \f4incfile\fP from various locations
in the backup service.
.PP
\f4incfile \-B\f1 is invoked as a child process by
the \f4bkdaemon\fP command
to perform an incremental backup of the filesystem
.I ofsname
(the originating filesystem).
All files in
.I ofsname
that have been modified or have had an inode change since the last
full backup are archived.
The resulting backup is created in
\f4cpio\f1 file format.
The backup is recorded
in the backup history log,
\f4/etc/bkup/bkhist.tab\f1.
.TP
.I bkjobid
the job id assigned by
\f4backup\f1.
The method uses the \f2bkjobid\f1 when it creates
history log and table-of-contents entries.
.TP
.I ofsname
the name of the filesystem that is to be backed up.
.TP
.I ofsdev
the name of the UNIX\*(rg
block special device on which the filesystem resides.
.TP ofslab
.I ofslab
the volume name on the filesystem [see
\f4labelit\f1(1M)].
.TP
.I descript
is a description for a destination device in the form:
.nf
.I
	dgroup:dname:dchar:dlabels
.fi
.I dgroup
specifies a device group
[see \f4devgroup.tab\f1(4)].
.br
\f2dname\fP
specifies a particular device name [see \f4device.tab\f1(4)].
.br
.I dchars
specifies characteristics associated with the device.
If specified, \f2dchar\f1
overrides the defaults for the specified device and group.
[See
\f4device.tab\f1(4)
for a further description of device characteristics].
.br
.I dlabels
specifies the volume names for the
media to be used for reading or writing
the archive.
.PP
\f4incfile \-T\f1 is invoked as a child process by
the \f4backup\f1
to archive a table-of-contents on the volumes described by
.I descript.
.TP
.I tocfname
the name of the file containing the table-of-contents.
.PP
\f4incfile \-RC\f1 and \f4incfile \-RF\f1
are invoked as child processes by the
\f4rsoper\f1 command
to extract files from an incremental filesystem archive
created by \f4incfile \-B\f1.
The filesystem archive is assumed to be in
\f4cpio\f1
format.
.PP
If the
\f4\-RC\f1
option is selected,
all files recorded in the archive are restored.
.TP
.I refsname
if non-null,
the name of the filesystem to be restored to instead of
.IR ofsname .
.TP
.I redev
if non-null, the partition to be restored to instead of
.IR ofsdev .
.PP
At least one of
.I refsname
and
.I redev
must be null.
.PP
If the
\f4\-RF\f1
option is specified,
only selected objects from the archive are restored.
Each 7-tuple, composed of
.IR rsjobid:uid:date:type:name:rename:inode ,
specifies an object to be restored from the filesystem archive.
The 7-tuple objects come to \f4incfile\fP from the \f4rsstatus.tab\f1 file.
.TP
.I rsjobid
the restore jobid assigned by
\f4restore\f1
or
\f4urestore\f1.
.TP
.I uid
the real uid of the user who requested the object to be restored.
It must match the uid of the owner of the object at the
time the archive was made,
or it must be the superuser uid.
.TP
.I date
the newest "last modification time" that is acceptable for a restorable
object.
The object is restored from the archive immediately
older than this date.
.I date
is a hexadecimal representation of the date and time provided
by the
\f4time\f1 system call.
.TP
.I type
either \f4F\f1 or \f4D\f1,
indicating that the object is a file or a directory,
respectively.
.TP
.I name
the name the object had in the filesystem archive.
.TP
\f4rename\fP
the name that the object should be restored to (it may differ
from the name the object had in the filesystem archive).
If omitted, the object is restored to
.I name.
.TP
\f4inode\fP
the inode number of the object as it was stored in the filesystem
archive.
.I [inode]
is not used by
\f4incfile \-R\f2,\f1
and is provided only for command-line compatibility with
other restoral methods.
.SS Options
Some options are only significant during
\f4incfile \-B\f1
invocations;
they are accepted but ignored during
\f4incfile \-R\f1
invocations because the command is invoked and options are specified
automatically by
\f4restore\f1.
These options are flagged with an asterisk (*).
.TP 10
\f4d*\f1
Inhibits the recording of the archive in the backup history log.
.TP 10
\f4i*\f1
Excludes from the backup those files that have only had an inode change.
.TP 10
\f4l*\f1
Creates a long form of the backup history log
that includes a table of contents for the archive.
This includes the data used to generate a
listing of each file in the archive like that produced by the
\f4ls -l\f1 command.
.TP 10
\f4m*\f1
Mounts the originating filesystem read-only before starting the backup
and remounts it with its original permissions after completing the backup.
Cannot be used with \f4root\f1 or \f4/usr\f1 filesystems.
.TP 10
\f4o\f1
Permits the user to override media insertion requests [see
the \f4getvol\f1(1M), \f4-o\f1 option].
.TP 10
\f4r*\f1
Includes remotely mounted resources in the archive.
.TP 10
\f4t*\f1
Creates a table of contents for the backup on additional media instead of
in the backup history log.
.TP 10
\f4v*\f1
Validates the archive as it is written.
A checksum is computed as the archive is being written;
as each medium is completed, it is re-read and the checksum
is recomputed to verify that each block is readable and correct.
If either check fails, the medium is considered unreadable.
If
\f4\-A\f1
has been specified, the archiving operation fails;
otherwise, the operator is prompted to replace the failed medium.
.TP 10
\f4x*\f1
Ignores the exception list; backs up all changed or modified files.
.TP 10
\f4A\f1
Establishes automated mode,
(i.e., does not prompt the user to insert or remove media).
.TP 10
\f4E*\f1
Reports an estimate of media usage for the archive,
then performs the backup.
.TP 10
\f4N*\f1
Reports an estimate of media usage for the archive,
but does not perform the backup.
.TP 10
\f4S\f1
Displays
a period (.) for every 100 (512 byte) blocks read-from or written-to
the archive on the destination device.
.TP 10
\f4V\f1
Displays
the name of each file written-to or extracted-from
the archive on the destination device.
.SS User Interactions
The connection between an archiving method and
the \f4backup\f1 command
is more complex than a simple \f4fork\f1/\f4exec\f1 or \f4pipe\f1.
The \f4backup\f1 command
is responsible for all interactions with the user,
either directly, or through
the \f4bkoper\f1 command.
Therefore,
\f4incfile\fP
neither reads from standard-input nor writes to standard-output or
standard-error.
A method library must be used
[see
\f4libbrmeth\f1(3)]
to communicate
reports (estimates, filenames, periods, status, etc.)
to
the \f4backup\f1 command.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The exit codes for \f4incfile\fP are the following:
.PP
0 = successful completion of the task
.br
1 = one or more parameters to \f4incfile\fP are invalid.
.br
2 = an error has occurred which caused \f4incfile\fP to fail to
      complete \f2all\f1 portions of its task.

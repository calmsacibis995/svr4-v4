password aging information, each displayed on a separate line.
The password information consists of password 
status (PS for passworded, NP for no password
or LK for locked).
If the login is passworded, status is followed by the 
date the
password was last changed, the number of days required between changes, and the
number of days allowed before a change is required.
The password aging information shows the time interval that the user will
receive a password expiration warning message (when logging on)
before the password expires.

The fields show how many days a password can remain unused before it
automatically becomes inactive and
the date that the password will expire.

When 
the \f4\-l\f1 and \f4\-g\f1 options are combined,
a user will only be listed
once, even if they belong to more than one of the selected groups.

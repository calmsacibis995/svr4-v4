.SH DESCRIPTION
.I generic_options
are options supported by the generic \f4fsck\f1 command.
.PP
The options are:
.TP 10
\f4\-F s5\f1
Specifies the \f4s5\f1-FSType.
.TP 10
\f4\-y\f1
Assume a \f4yes\f1 response to all questions asked by 
\f4fsck\f1.
.TP 10
\f4\-n\f1
Assume a \f4no\f1 response to all questions asked by 
\f4fsck\f1;
do not open the file system for writing.
.TP 10
\f4\-p\f1
Correct inconsistencies that can be fixed automatically,
that is, inconsistencies that are deemed harmless and
can be fixed without confirmation by the administrator.
Examples of such inconsistencies are unreferenced i-nodes,
incorrect counts in the superblocks, and missing blocks
in the free list.
.TP 10
\f4\-s\f2X\f1
Ignore the actual free list and (unconditionally) reconstruct a new
one by rewriting the super-block of the file system.  
The file system should be unmounted while this is done; if this
is not possible, care should be taken that the system is quiescent
and that it is rebooted immediately afterwards.
This precaution is necessary so that the old, bad, in-core copy
of the superblock will not continue to be used, or written on the file system.
.sp.5
The
\f4\-s\f2X\f1
suboption allows for creating an optimal free-list organization.
.sp.5
If 
.I X\^
is not given,
the values used when the file system was created
are used.
The format of \f2X\f1 is \f2cylinder size\f1:\f2gap size\f1.
.TP 10
\f4\-S\f2X\f1
Conditionally reconstruct the free list. This suboption
is like
\f4\-s\f2X\f1
above except that the free list is rebuilt only
if there were no discrepancies discovered in the
file system. Using
\f4S\f1
will force a \f4no\f1 response to all questions asked
by
\f4fsck\f1.
This suboption is useful for forcing free list reorganization
on uncontaminated file systems.
.TP 10
\f4\-t\f2file\f1
If
\f4fsck\f1
cannot obtain enough memory to keep its tables,
it uses a scratch file. If the \f4t\fP option is
specified, the \f2file\f1 named
is used as the scratch file, if needed.
Without the
\f4t\f1 option,
\f4fsck\f1
will prompt the user for the name of the
scratch file. The file chosen should not be on the
file system being checked, and if it is not
a special file or did not already exist, it is
removed when
\f4fsck\f1
completes.
.TP 10
\f4\-l\f1
Identify damaged files by their logical names.
.TP 10
\f4\-q\f1
Quiet
\f4fsck\f1.
Unreferenced
\f4fifos\f1
will silently be removed. 
If
\f4fsck\f1
requires it, counts in the superblock will be automatically
fixed and the free list salvaged.
.TP 10
\f4\-D\f1
Directories are checked for bad blocks.
Useful after system crashes.
.TP 10
\f4\-f\f1
Fast check.
Check block and sizes and check the free list.
The free list will be reconstructed if it is necessary.
.PP
.ne 10
Inconsistencies checked are as follows:
.sp
.RS
.PD 0
.TP 6
1.
Blocks claimed by more than one i-node or the free list.
.TP 6
2.
Blocks claimed by an i-node or the free list outside the range of the file system.
.TP 6
3.
Incorrect link counts.
.TP 6
4.
Size checks:
.IP "" 12
Incorrect number of blocks.
.br
Directory size not 16-byte aligned.
.TP 6
5.
Bad i-node format.
.TP 6
6.
Blocks not accounted for anywhere.
.TP 6
7.
Directory checks:
.IP "" 12
File pointing to unallocated i-node.
.br
I-node number out of range.
.TP 6
8.
Super Block checks:
.IP "" 12
More than 65536 i-nodes.
.br
More blocks for i-nodes than there are in the file system.
.TP 6
9.
Bad free block list format.
.TP 6
10.
Total free block and/or free i-node count incorrect.
.RE
.PD
.PP
Orphaned files and directories (allocated but unreferenced) are,
with the user's concurrence, reconnected by
placing them in the 
\f4lost+found\f1
directory, if the files are nonempty.
The user will be notified if the file or directory is empty or not.
Empty files or directories are removed, as long as the 
\f4n\f1
suboption is not specified.
\f4fsck\f1
will force the reconnection of nonempty directories.
The name assigned is the i-node number.
.PP
.SH NOTE
Checking the raw device is almost always faster.
.PP
I-node numbers for \f4.\f1 and \f4.\|.\f1
in each directory are not checked for validity.

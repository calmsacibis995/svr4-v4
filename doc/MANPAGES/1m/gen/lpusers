.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4lpusers\f1 command is used 
to set limits to the queue priority level that can be assigned to 
jobs submitted by users of the LP print service.
.PP
The first form of the command (with \f4\-d\f1) sets the system-wide
priority default to \f2priority-level\f1, where
\f2priority-level\f1 is a value of 0 to 39, with 0
being the highest priority.
If a user does not specify a priority level with a
print request [see \f4lp\f1(1)], the default
priority is used.
Initially, the default priority level is 20.
.PP
The second form of the command (with \f4\-q\f1 and \f4\-u\f1)
sets the default highest
\f2priority-level\f1 (\|0\^-\^39\|) that the users in
\f2login-\s-1ID\s+1-list\f1 can request when submitting a print request.
The \f2login-\s-1ID\s+1-list\f1 argument may include 
any or all of the following constructs:
.TP 1.25i
\f2login-ID\f1
A user on any system
.TP
\f2system_name\f4!\f2login-ID\f1
A user on the system \f2system_name\f1
.TP
\f2system_name\f4!all\f1
All users on system \f2system_name\f1
.TP
\f4all!\f2login-ID\f1
A user on all systems
.TP
\f4all\f1
All users on all systems
.PP
Users that have been given a limit cannot submit a
print request with a higher priority level than the
one assigned, nor can they change a request already
submitted to have a higher priority.
Any print requests submitted with priority levels higher than
allowed will be given the highest priority allowed.
.PP
The third form of the command (with \f4\-u\f1) 
removes any explicit priority level for the specified users.
.PP
The fourth form of the command
(with \f4\-q\f1) sets the default highest
priority level for all users
not explicitly covered by the use of the second
form of this command.
.PP
The last form of the command (with \f4\-l\f1) 
lists the default priority level 
and the priority limits assigned to users.

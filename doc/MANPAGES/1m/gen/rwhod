.SH NAME
\f4rwhod\f1, \f4in.rwhod\f1 \- system status server
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4in.rwhod\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4rwhod\f1
is the server which maintains the database used by the
\f4rwho\f1(1)
and\p
.br
\f4ruptime\f1(1)
programs.
Its operation is predicated on the ability to
broadcast messages on a network.
.LP
\f4rwhod\f1
operates as both a producer and consumer of status information.
As a producer of information it periodically
queries the state of the system and constructs
status messages which are broadcast on a network.
As a consumer of information, it listens for other
\f4rwhod\f1
servers' status messages, validating them, then recording
them in a collection of files located in the directory
\f4/var/spool/rwho\f1.
.LP
The
\f4rwho\f1
server transmits and receives messages at the port indicated
in the \f4rwho\f1 service specification, see
\f4services\f1(4).
The messages sent and received, are of the form:
.RS
.nf
.ft 4
struct	outmp {
.RS
.ft 4
char	out_line[8];	/* tty name */
char	out_name[8];	/* user id */
long	out_time;	/* time on */
.RE
.ft 4
};
.sp
.ft 4
struct	whod {
.RS
.ft 4
char	wd_vers;
char	wd_type;
char	wd_fill[2];
int	wd_sendtime;
int	wd_recvtime;
char	wd_hostname[32];
int	wd_loadav[3];
int	wd_boottime;
.RS
.ft 4
struct	whoent {
struct	outmp we_utmp;
int	we_idle;
.RE
.ft 4
} wd_we[1024 / sizeof (struct whoent)];
.RE
.ft 4
};
.fi
.ft 1
.RE
.LP
All fields are converted to network byte order prior to
transmission.  The load averages are as calculated by the
\f1w\f1(1)
program, and represent load averages over the 5, 10, and 15 minute
intervals prior to a server's transmission.  The host name
included is that returned by the
\f4gethostname\f1(2)
system call.
The array at the end of the message contains information about
the users logged in to the sending machine.  This information
includes the contents of the
\f4utmp\f1(4)
entry for each non-idle terminal line and a value indicating the
time since a character was last received on the terminal line.
.LP
Messages received by the
\f4rwho\f1
server are discarded unless they originated at a
\f4rwho\f1
server's port.  In addition, if the host's name, as specified
in the message, contains any unprintable
.SM ASCII
characters, the
message is discarded.  Valid messages received by
\f4rwhod\f1
are placed in files named
\f4whod.\f2hostname\f1
in the directory
\f4/var/spool/rwho\f1.
These files contain only the most recent message, in the
format described above.
.LP
Status messages are generated approximately once every
60 seconds.
\f4rwhod\f1
performs an
\f4nlist\f1(3)
on
\f4/stand/unix\f1
every 10 minutes to guard against
the possibility that this file is not the system
image currently operating.

.SH NOTES
This service takes up progressively more network bandwidth as
the number of hosts on the local net increases.  For large
networks, the cost becomes prohibitive.
.LP
\f4rwhod\f1
should relay status information between networks.
People often interpret the server dying
as a machine going down.
.LP
For \f4rwho\f1 to work properly, the directory
\f4/var/spool/rwho\f1 must exist on the system.

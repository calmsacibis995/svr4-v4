.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/usr/lib/uucp/uucleanup\f1 [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4uucleanup\fP
will scan the spool directories for old files
and take appropriate action to remove them in a
useful way:
.P
.RS
Inform the requester of send/receive requests for
systems that can not be reached.
.sp .5
Return undeliverable mail to the sender.
.sp .5
Deliver \f4rnews\f1 files addressed to the local system.
.sp .5
Remove all other files.
.RE
.PP
In addition, there is a provision to warn users of requests that
have been waiting for a given number of days (default 1).
Note that
\f4uucleanup\fP
will process as if all option
\f4times\fP
were specified to the default values unless \f2time\f1 is specifically set.
.PP
The following options are available.
.TP 10
\f4\-C\f2time\^\f1
Any \f4C.\f1 files greater or equal to \f2time\f1 days old will be
removed with appropriate information to the requester.
(default 7 days)
.TP
\f4\-D\f2time\^\f1
Any \f4D.\f1 files greater or equal to \f2time\f1 days old will be
removed.
An attempt will be made to deliver mail messages and
execute rnews when appropriate.
(default 7 days)
.TP
\f4\-W\f2time\^\f1
Any \f4C.\f1 files equal to \f2time\f1 days old will
cause a mail message to be sent to the requester warning about
the delay in contacting the remote.
The message includes the \f2JOBID\f1, and in the case of mail,
the mail message.
The administrator may include a message line telling whom to
call to check the problem (\f4\-m\f1 option).
(default 1 day)
.TP
\f4\-X\f2time\^\f1
Any \f4X.\f1 files greater or equal to \f2time\f1 days old will be
removed.
The \f4D.\f1 files are probably not present (if they were, the \f4X.\f1 could get
executed).
But if there are \f4D.\f1 files, they will be taken care of by D. processing.
(default 2 days)
.TP
\f4\-m\f2string\^\f1
Include \f2string\f1 in the warning message generated by the
\f4\-W\f1
option.
.TP
\f4\-o\f2time\^\f1
Other files whose age is more than
.I time\^
days will be deleted.
(default 2 days)
The default line is "See your local administrator to locate the problem".
.TP
\f4\-s\f2system\^\f1
Execute for \f4system\fP spool directory only.
.PP
.TP 10
\f4\-x\f2debug_level\f1
The
\f4\-x\f1
debug level is a single digit between 0 and 9;
higher numbers give more detailed debugging information.
(This option may not be available on all systems.)
.ig
\" Commenting out stuff that applies only to source licensees:

\"there will be very little debugging output.
..

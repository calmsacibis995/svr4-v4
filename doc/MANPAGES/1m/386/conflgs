.SH NAME
\f4conflgs\f1 \- change and display console flags
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/etc/conflgs\f1
[\f4\-a\f1 0|1]
[\f4\-c\f1 0|1]
[\f4\-m\f1 0|1]
[\f4\-r\f1 0|1]
[\f4\-b baud\f1]
or

[\f4\-m\f1 0|1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4conflgs\f1
allows the remote console and console flags to be set and displayed.
It can be used to enable or disable the remote console capability.
\f4conflgs\f1  allows console redirection
(diagnostics and bootstrap input/output)
to the second serial port to be enabled or disabled.
Note that
\f4conflgs\f1
does not control what device is used as console \(em this is determined
by whether or not the system is equipped with an integral console
and by the COM2CONS tunable parameter.
The console message flag and remote console message flag,
which determine whether or not system error messages
are directed to the console or remote console,
can also be temporarily changed with
\f4conflgs\f1.
.TP 8
\f4\-a\f1 0|1
disable (0) or enable (1) diagnostics and bootstrap redirection
to the second serial port.
If enabled and the second serial port is used as
the console, the baud rate specified with the
\f4\-b\f1
option determines the baud rate used for the console.
If the second serial port is used as the console
but console redirection to the second serial port is disabled,
the console baud rate is 9600.
.TP
\f4\-r\f1 0|1
disable (0) or enable (1) the remote console feature.
This controls console redirection to the first serial port
and sets the remote console enable flag (RCEF).
The baud rate specified with the
\f4\-b\f1
option determines the baud rate used for the remote console.
.TP
\f4\-c\f1 0|1
disable (0) or enable (1) sending system error messages to the console.
This change only lasts until the system is rebooted.
To permanently have system error messages directed to the console,
change the CMF tunable parameter.
.TP
\f4\-m\f1 0|1
disable (0) or enable (1) sending system error messages to the remote console.
This change only lasts until the system is rebooted.
The RCEF must be turned on before this flag for console messages to
be seen on the remote console.
On some systems,  the RCEF is considered on
and the remote console baud rate is fixed at 1200.
To permanently have system error messages directed to the remote console,
change the RCMF tunable parameter.
.PP
If the
\f4\-a\f1
and/or
\f4\-r\f1
option is used, the
\f4\-b baud\f1
option can be used to set the baud rate of the first or second serial port
to \f4baud\f1.
\f4baud\f1 can be 1200 or 9600.
If the
\f4\-b\f1
option is not specified when enabling console redirection to
the first or second serial port
a default baud rate of 1200 is used.
The baud rate specifies the baud rate to be used during
diagnostics, bootstrap, and system initialization \- until the multi-user state
is reached.
It does not take effect until the next system reboot or \f2init S\f1.
.PP
The    
\f4\-a\f1
\f4\-r\f1,
and
\f4\-b\f1
options may or or may not be provided on all 386 machines.
.PP
The values of all the console flags are always displayed after the
requested changes are made.
.PP
Note that the BIOS 
setup utility can also be used to change the whether or not
console redirection to the first or second serial ports is enabled
and their baud rates.

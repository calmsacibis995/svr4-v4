.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4ifconfig\f1
is used to assign an address
to a network interface and/or to configure
network interface parameters.
\f4ifconfig\f1
must be used at boot time to define the network address
of each interface present on a machine; it may also be used at
a later time to redefine an interface's address
or other operating parameters.
Used without options,
\f4ifconfig\f1
displays the current configuration for a network interface.
If a protocol family is specified,
\f4ifconfig\f1
will report only the details specific to that protocol family.
Only the super-user may modify the configuration
of a network interface.
.LP
The
.I interface
parameter is a string of the form \(lqname unit\(rq, for example
\f4emd1\f1.
.\" The interface name
.\" \f4\-a\f1
.\" is reserved, and causes the remainder of the arguments to be applied to
.\" each address of each interface in turn.
.LP
Since an interface may receive transmissions in differing protocols,
each of which may require separate naming schemes, the parameters and
addresses are interpreted according to
the rules of some address family,
specified by the
.I address_family
parameter.  The address families currently supported are
\f4ether\f1 and \f4inet\f1.
If no address family is specified,
\f4inet\f1
is assumed.
.LP
For the
.SM DARPA
Internet family
(\f4inet\f1),
the address is either a host name present in the host name data
base [see
\f4hosts\f1(4)],
or a
.SM DARPA
Internet address expressed in the Internet standard
\(lqdot notation\(rq.  Typically, an Internet
address specified in dot notation
will consist of your system's network number and the machine's
unique host number.  A typical Internet address is
\f4192.9.200.44\f1,
where
\f4192.9.200\f1
is the network number and
\f444\f1
is the machine's
host number.
.LP
For the
\f4ether\f1
address family,
the address is an Ethernet address represented as
.IR x : x : x :\c
.IR x : x : x
where
.I x
is a hexadecimal number between 0 and ff.
Only the super-user may use the
\f4ether\f1
address family.
.LP
If the
.I dest_address
parameter is supplied in addition to the
.I address
parameter, it specifies the address of
the correspondent on the other end
of a point to point link.
.SH OPTIONS
The following
.I parameters
may be set with
\f4ifconfig\f1:
.TP .75i
\f4up\f1
Mark an interface \(lqup\(rq.
This may be used to enable an interface after an \(lqifconfig down.\(rq
It happens automatically when setting the
first address on an interface.
If the interface was reset when previously marked down,
the hardware will be re-initialized.
.TP
\f4down\f1
Mark an interface \(lqdown\(rq.  When an interface is
marked \(lqdown\(rq, the system will not attempt to
transmit messages through that interface.
If possible, the interface will be reset to disable reception as\p
.br
.ne 1i
well.
This action does not automatically disable routes using the interface.
.TP
\f4trailers\f1
(\f4inet\f1 only)
Enable the use of a \(lqtrailer\(rq
link level encapsulation when
sending.
If a network interface supports trailer encapsulation,
the system will, when possible, encapsulate outgoing
messages in a manner which minimizes the number of
memory to memory copy operations performed by the receiver.
This feature is machine-dependent, and therefore not recommended.
On networks that support the Address Resolution Protocol [see
\f4arp\f1(7)];
currently, only 10 Mb/s Ethernet),
this flag indicates that the system should request that other
systems use trailer encapsulation when sending to this host.
Similarly, trailer encapsulations will be used when sending to other
hosts that have made such requests.
.TP
\f4\-trailers\f1
Disable the use of a \(lqtrailer\(rq link level encapsulation.
.TP
\f4arp\f1
Enable the use of the Address Resolution Protocol in mapping
between network level addresses and link level addresses (default).
This is currently implemented for mapping between
.SM DARPA
Internet addresses and 10Mb/s Ethernet addresses.
.TP
\f4\-arp\f1
Disable the use of the Address Resolution Protocol.
.TP
\f4metric \f2n\f1
Set the routing metric of the interface to
.IR n ,
default 0.
The routing metric is used by the routing protocol
[\f4routed\f1(1M)].
Higher metrics have the effect of making a route
less favorable; metrics are counted as addition hops
to the destination network or host.
.TP
\f4broadcast \f2address\f1
(\f4inet\f1
only)
Specify the address to use to represent broadcasts to the
network.
The default broadcast address is the
address with a host part of all 1's.
A
\f4+\f1
(plus sign) given for the broadcast value causes the broadcast address to
be reset to a default appropriate for the (possibly new) Internet address.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
If your workstation is not attached to an Ethernet, the
\f4emd1\f1
interface should be marked \(lqdown\(rq as follows:
.IP
\f4ifconfig emd1 down\f1
.SH FILES
.PD 0
.TP 20
\f4/dev/nit\f1
.PD
.SH "SEE ALSO"
\f4netstat\f1(1M),
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Messages indicating the specified interface does not exist, the
requested address is unknown, or the user is not privileged and
tried to alter an interface's configuration.

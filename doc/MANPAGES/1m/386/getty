.SH NAME
\f4getty\f1 \- set terminal type, modes, speed, and line discipline
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4getty\fP [ \f4\-h\fP ] [ \f4\-t\fP \f2timeout\fP ]
\f2line\fP [ \f2speed\fP [ \f2type\fP [ \f2linedisc\fP ] ] ]
.sp .5
\f4getty\fP \f4\-c\fP \f2file\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4getty\fP is included for compatibility with previous releases 
for the few applications that still call
\f4getty\f1 directly.
\f4getty\fP
can only be executed by the superuser, that is, by a process with
the user ID \f4root\f1.
Initially
\f4getty\fP
prints the login prompt, waits for the user's login name,
and then invokes the \f4login\f1 command.
\f4getty\fP
attempts to adapt the system to the terminal speed
by using the options and arguments specified on the command line.
.TP
.I line
The name of a TTY line in \f4/dev\fP to which
\f4getty\fP
is to attach itself.
\f4getty\fP
uses this string as the name of a file in the \f4/dev\fP directory
to open for reading and writing.
.TP
\f4-h\fP
If the
\f4\-h\fP
flag is not set,
a hangup will be forced by setting the speed to zero
before setting the speed to the default or specified speed.
.TP
\f4\-t\fP \f2timeout\fP
specifies that
\f4getty\fP
should exit if the open on the line succeeds and no
one types anything in \f2timeout\fP seconds.
.TP
.I speed
The \f2speed\fP argument
is a label to a speed and TTY definition in the file
\f4/etc/ttydefs\f1.
This definition tells
\f4getty\fP
at what speed to run initially, 
what the initial TTY settings are, and what speed to try next,
should the user indicate, by pressing the BREAK key,
that the speed is inappropriate.
The default \f2speed\fP is 1200 baud.
.TP
\f2type\fP and \f2linedisc\fP
.br
These options are obsolete and will be ignored.
.TP
\f4-c\fP \f2file\fP
The
\f4\-c\f1
option is no longer supported.
Instead use 
\f4sttydefs -l\fP
to list the contents of the \f4/etc/ttydefs\fP file and perform
a validity check on the file.
.PP
When given no optional arguments,
\f4getty\fP
specifies the following:
The \f2speed\fP of the interface is set to 1200 baud,
either parity is allowed,
new-line characters are converted to carriage return-line feed,
and tab expansion is performed on the standard output.
\f4getty\fP types the login prompt before reading
the user's name a character at a time.
If a null character (or framing error) 
is received, it is assumed to be the result
of the user pressing the BREAK key.
This will cause
\f4getty\fP
to attempt the next \f2speed\fP in the series.
The series that
\f4getty\fP
tries is determined by what it finds in
\f4/etc/\f3ttydefs\fP\f1.
.SH NOTES
Developers are encouraged to use \f4ttymon\fP(1M) as support for \f4getty\fP
may be dropped in the future.

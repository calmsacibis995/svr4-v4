.SH NAME
\f4df\f1 (generic), \f4dfspace\fP \- report number of free disk blocks and files/free disk space
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4df \f1[\|\f4\-F \f2FSType\f1] [\|\f4\-befgiklntV\f1]
[\f2current_options\f1]
[\|\f4\-o \f2specific_options\f1]
.br
	\f1[\f2directory | special | resource...\f1]
.sp .5
\f4dfspace\f1 [\f4-F \f2FSType\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4df\f1 command prints the
allocation portions of the generic superblock
for mounted or unmounted file systems, 
directories or mounted resources.
\f2directory\f1 represents a valid directory name.
If \f2directory\f1 is specified,
\f4df\f1 reports on the device that contains the \f2directory\f1.
\f2special\f1 represents a special device (e.g., \f4/dev/dsk/0s1\f1).
\f2resource\f1 is an RFS/NFS resource name.
If arguments to \f4df\fP are pathnames,
\f4df\fP produces a report on the file system containing the named file.
.P
The \f4df\fP command reports sizes in 512 byte blocks.
It will report 2 blocks less free space, rather than 1 block,
since the file uses one system block of 1-24 bytes.
.P
The directory \f4/etc/fscmd.d/TYPE\fP contains programs for each
filesystem type; \f4df\fP invokes the appropriate binary.
\f4/etc/fscmd.d\fP is linked to \f4/etc/fs\fP.
.PP
\f2current_options\f1
are options supported by the \f4s5\f1-specific module of \f4df\f1.
Other FSTypes do not necessarily support these options.
\f2specific_options\f1 indicate suboptions specified in a comma-separated 
list of suboptions and/or keyword-attribute pairs for interpretation by 
the \f2FSType\f1-specific module of the command. 
.PP
The generic options are:
.TP 12 
\f4\-F\f1
Specify the \f2FSType\f1 on which to operate.
This is only needed if the file system is unmounted.
The \f2FSType\f1 should be specified here
or are determined from \f4/etc/vfstab\f1
by matching the \f2mount_point\f1, \f2special\f1,
or \f2resource\f1 with an entry in the table.
.TP 12 
\f4\-b\f1
Print only the number of kilobytes free.
.TP 12 
\f4\-e\f1
Print only the number of files free.
.TP 12
\f4-f\fP
Reports only an actual count of the blocks in the free list
(free inodes arn not reported).
With this option, \f4df\fP reports on raw devices.
.TP 12 
\f4\-g\f1
Print the entire \f4statvfs\f1 structure.
Used only for mounted file systems.
Can not be used with \f2current_options\fP
or with the \f4-o\fP option.
This option will override the \f4-b\fP,
\f4-e\fP, \f4-k\fP, \f4-n\fP, and \f4-t\fP options.
.TP 12
\f4\-i\fP
Display the total number of inodes, the number of free inodes,
the number of used inodes, and the percentage of inodes in use.
.TP 12 
\f4\-k\f1
Print allocation in kilobytes. This option should be invoked by itself
because its output format is different from that of the other options.
.TP 12 
\f4\-l\f1
Report on local file systems only.
Used only for mounted file systems.
Can not be used with \f2current_options\fP
or with the \f4-o\fP option.
.TP 12 
\f4\-n\f1
Print only the \f2FSType\f1 name.
Invoked with no arguments this option
prints a list of mounted file system types.
Used only for mounted file systems.
Can not be used with \f2current_options\fP
or with the \f4-o\fP option.
.TP 12 
\f4\-t\f1
Causes total allocated block figures to be reported as well as number of free
blocks.
.TP 12 
\f4\-V\f1
Echo the complete command line,
but do not execute the command.
The command line is generated by using
the options and arguments provided by the user
and adding to them information
derived from \f4/etc/mnttab\f1 or \f4/etc/vfstab\f1.
This option should be used to
verify and validate the command line.
.TP 12 
\f4\-o\f1
Specify FSType-specific options.
.TP 12
\f4\-v\f1
Reports percent of blocks used as well as the
number of blocks used and free.
The \f4-v\fP option cannot be used with other options.
.PP
If no arguments or options are specified, the free space on 
all local and remotely mounted file systems is printed.
.P
\f4dfspace\fP is a shell script that uses the \f4df\fP command.
\f4dfspace\fP reports the available disk space for all mounted file systems
with the exception of pseudo file systems such as \f4/proc\fP. 
\f4dfspace\fP reports the free disk space in mega bytes and also
as a percentage of total disk space.
.P
Without arguments, \f4dfspace\fP reports the free disk space on all file systems.
.P
The option for \f4dfspace\fP is:
.TP 12
\f4-F \f2FSType\fP
find free disk space on \f2FSType\fP file system.
.SH NOTES
The \f4\-F\f1 option is intended for use with unmounted file systems. 
.P
This command may not be supported for all FSTypes.
.P
If options \f4-g\f1 or \f4-n\f1 are used when there are
remotely mounted resources, \f4df\f1 will try to determine the 
remote resource's file system type. If it can be determined,
\f4df\f1 will print the file system type; otherwise, it 
will print \f4unknown\fP.

.SH NAME
\f4idbuild\f1 \- build new UNIX System kernel
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/etc/conf/bin/idbuild\f1
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This script builds a new UNIX System kernel using the current system
configuration in
\f4etc/conf/\f1\|.
Kernel reconfigurations are usually done after a device driver
is installed, or system tunable parameters are modified.
The script uses the shell variable
\f4ROOT\f1
from the user's environment as its starting path.
Except for the special case of kernel development in a non-root
source tree, the shell variable
\f4ROOT\f1
should always be set to null or to "/".
\f4idbuild\f1
exits with a return code of zero on success and non-zero on failure.
.P
Building a new UNIX System image consists of generating
new system configuration files,
then link-editing the kernel and device driver object modules in the
\f4etc/conf/pack.d\f1
object tree.
This is done by
\f4idbuild\f1
by calling the following commands:
.TP 1.7i
\f4etc/conf/bin/idconfig\f1
To build kernel configuration files.
.TP
\f4etc/conf/bin/idmkunix\f1
To process the configuration files and link-edit
a new UNIX System image.
.P
The system configuration files are built by processing the Master and System files
representing device driver and tunable parameter specifications.
For the i386 UNIX System the files
\f4etc/conf/cf.d/mdevice\f1,
and
\f4etc/conf/cf.d/mtune\f1
represent the Master information.
The files
\f4etc/conf/cf.d/stune\f1,
and the files specified in
\f4etc/conf/sdevice.d/*\f1
represent the System information.
The kernel also has file system type information defined in the files specified by
\f4etc/conf/sfsys.d/*\f1
and
\f4etc/conf/mfsys.d/*\f1 .
.P
Once a new UNIX System kernel has been configured, a lock file is set in
\f4etc/.new_unix\f1
which causes the new kernel to replace
\f4/unix\f1
on the next system shutdown (i.e.\, on the next entry to the
.I "init 0"
state).
Upon the next system boot, the new kernel will be executed.
.SH "ERROR MESSAGES"
.P
Since
\f4idbuild\f1
calls other system commands to accomplish system reconfiguration and
link editing, it will report all errors encountered by those commands,
then clean up intermediate files created in the process.
In general, the exit value 1 indicates an error was encountered by
\f4idbuild\f1 .
.P
The errors encountered fall into the following categories:
.P
.RS
Master file error messages.
.br
System file error messages.
.br
Tunable file error messages.
.br
Compiler and Link-editor error messages.
.RE
.P
All error messages are designed to be self-explanatory.

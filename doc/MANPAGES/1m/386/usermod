.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4usermod\f1 command modifies a user's login definition
on the system.
It changes the definition of the specified login and makes the
appropriate login-related system file and file system changes.
.P
The system file entries created with this command have a limit of 512
characters per line.
Specifying long arguments to several options may exceed this limit.
.P
The following options are available:
.TP 1.2i
\f4\-u \f2uid\f1
New 
UID
for the user.
It must be a non-negative decimal integer below \f4MAXUID\f1 as defined in 
\f4<param.h>\f1.
.TP
\f4\-o\f1
This option allows the specified 
UID 
to be duplicated (non-unique).
.TP
\f4\-g \f2group\f1
An existing group's integer 
ID
or character-string name.
It redefines the user's primary group membership.
.TP
\f4\-G \f2group\f1
An existing group's integer 
"ID" ","
or character string name.
It redefines the user's supplementary group membership.
Duplicates between
\f4group\fP with the \f4\-g\f1 and \f4\-G\f1 options are ignored.
No more than \f4NGROUPS_UMAX\f1 groups may be specified as defined in 
\f4<param.h>\f1.
.TP
\f4\-d \f2dir\f1
The new home directory of the user.
It defaults to \f2base_dir/login\fP, where \f2base_dir\f1 is
the base directory for new login home directories,
and \f2login\fP is the new login.
.TP
\f4\-m\f1
Move the user's home directory to
the new directory specified with the \f4\-d\f1 option.
If the directory already exists,
it must have permissions read/write/execute
by \f2group\fP, where \f2group\f1 is the user's primary group.
.TP
\f4\-s \f2shell\f1
Full pathname of the program that is used as the user's shell on login.
The value of \f2shell\f1 must be a valid executable file.
.TP
\f4\-c \f2comment\f1
Any text string.
It is generally a short description of the login, and
is currently used as the field for the user's full name.
This information is stored in the user's \f4/etc/passwd\f1 entry.
.TP
\f4\-l \f2new_logname\f1
A string of printable characters that specifies the new login name for
the user.
It may not contain a colon (\f4:\f1) or a newline (\f4\\n\f1).
.TP
\f4\-e \f2expire\f1
The date on which a login can no longer be used;
after this date,
no user will be able to access this login.
(This option is useful for creating temporary logins.)
You may type the value of the argument \f2expire\fP 
(which is a date) in any format\p
.br
.ne 3
you like
(except a Julian date).
For example, you may enter
\f410/6/90\fP or \f4October 6, 1990\f1.
A value of \f4""\f1 defeats
the status of the expired date.
.TP
\f4\-f \f2inactive\f1
The maximum number of days allowed 
between uses of a login
\f4ID\f1 before that login \f4ID\f1 is declared valid.
Normal values are positive integers.
A value of \f4\-1\f1 defeats the status.
.TP
\f2login\fP
A string of printable characters that specifies the existing login name
of the user.
It must exist and may not contain a colon 
(\f4:\f1), or a newline (\f4\\n\f1).

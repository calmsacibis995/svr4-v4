.SH NAME
\f4custom\f1 - install specific portions of a UNIX package
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4custom [-ir] \f1[\f2package\f1] ] [\f4-m\f1 \f2device\f1] [\f4-f\f1 [\f2file\f1] ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4custom\f1 allows the super-user to create a custom installation
by selectively installing or deleting portions of the UNIX packages
to or from the 386 operating system.  It can be used interactively
or it can be invoked from the command line with applicable command
options.
.PP
Files are extracted or deleted in \f2packages.\f1  A \f2package\f1
is a collection of individual files that are grouped together in
\f2sets\f1.
.PP
When in interactive mode, \f4custom\f1 prompts you for volume 1 of
the new product distribution and extracts the product information
necessary to support it.  The following menu provides support for 
adding or removing a package:
.nf
.sp .5
.in 1i
1. Install one or more packages
2. Remove one or more packages
3. List the files in a package
4. Install a single file
5. Select a new set to customize
6. Display current disk usage
7. Help
.fi
.PP
When you enter a menu option, you are prompted for further
information.  The following describes what actions are necessary
for each menu option:  
.sp .5
1.  Install
.in +1P
.sp .5
Prompts for one or more package names
.sp 0.5
Calculates which installation volumes (distribution media) are
needed and then prompts the user for the correct volume numbers.   If
multiple packages are specified, the names should be separated
by spaces on the command line.
.sp .5
This option, as well as "2" and "3," displays a list of 
available packages in the selected set.  Each line
describes the package name, whether the package is fully 
installed, not installed or partially installed, the size of
the package (in 512 byte blocks), and a one line description of
the package contents.
.PP
2.  Remove
.in +1P
.sp .5
Prompts for one or more package names.
.sp 0.5
Deletes the correct files in the specified package.  If multiple
packages are specified, the names should be separated by spaces
on the command line.
.sp 0.5
Displays available packages (see option "1").
.PP
3.  List files in a package
.in +1P
.sp .5
Lists all files in the specified package
.sp 0.5
.ne 6
Prompts for one or more package names.
Enter the name of the
desired package(s).
.sp 0.5
Displays available packages (see option "1").
.PP
4.  Install a single file
.in +1P
.sp .5
Retrieves the specified file from the distribution set
.sp .5
Filename should be a full pathname relative to the root directory
"/".
.PP
5.  Select a new set
.in +1P
.sp .5
Allows the user to work from a  different set 
.PP
6.  Display current disk usage
.in +1P
.sp .5
Tells current disk usage.
.PP
7.  Help
.in +1P
.sp .5
Prints a page of instructions to help you use \f2custom\f1.
.sp .5
.nf
\f4-s\f1  A set identifier
.sp .5
\f4-i\f1  Install the specified package(s)
.sp .5
\f4-r\f1  Remove the specified package(s)
.sp .5
\f4-l\f1  List the files in the specified package(s)
.sp .5
\f4-f\f1  Install the specified file
.fi
.PP
The \f4-m\f1 flag specifies the media device.
The default is \f4/dev/install\f1 (which is always the 0 device, as in
\f4/dev/fd0\f1).
This is very useful if the system has a 5.25-inch
drive on \f4/dev/fd0\f1 and a 3.5-inch floppy on \f4/dev/fd1\f1 and it is
necessary to install 3.5-inch media.
For example:
.sp .5
.ti +3P
\f4custom -m /dev/rfd196ds9\f1
.sp .5
This will override the default device and use the one supplied
with the \f4-m\f1 flag.
.PP
If any information is missing from the command line, \f4custom\f1
prompts for the missing data.
.SH NOTES
When installing some XENIX applications, error messages such as "\f4bad gid\f1"
or "\f4bad uid\f1" may be printed.
These messages occur because XENIX and UNIX
assign UID and GID numbers differently.
If necessary, the file and/or
directory permissions can be altered with "\f4chmod\f1(1)" after installation.

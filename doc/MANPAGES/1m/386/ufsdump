.SH NAME
\f4ufsdump\f1 \- incremental file system dump
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/usr/sbin/ufsdump\f1
[\f2options\f1]
.I filesystem
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\f4ufsdump\f1
backs up all files in
.IR filesystem ,
where \f2filesystem\fP represents a special device,
or files changed after a certain date,
to magnetic tape;
.I options
is a string that specifies
\f4ufsdump\f1
options, as shown below.
.LP
If no
.I options
are given, the default is
\f49u\f1.
.LP
The options are:
.TP .75i
\f4 0\-9\f1
The \(lqdump level.\(rq
All files in the
.I filesystem
that have been modified since the last
\f4ufsdump\f1
at a lower dump level are copied to the volume.
For instance,
if you did a 
\(lqlevel 
\f42\f1\(rq
dump on Monday,
followed by a 
\(lqlevel 
\f44\f1\(rq
dump on Tuesday,
a subsequent
\(lqlevel 
\f43\f1\(rq
dump on Wednesday would contain
all files modified or added
since the \(lqlevel 
\f42\f1\(rq
(Monday) backup.
A \(lqlevel 
\f40\f1\(rq
dump copies the entire filesystem to the dump volume.
.TP
\f4\-b\f2 factor\f1
Blocking factor.
Specify the blocking factor for tape writes.
The default is 20 blocks per write.
Note:
the blocking factor is
specified in terms of 512 bytes blocks,
for compatibility with
\f4tar\f1.
The default blocking factor for tapes of
density 6250\s-1BPI\s0 and greater is 64.
The default blocking factor for cartridge tapes
\f1(\f4\-c\f1
option specified) is 126.
The highest blocking
factor available with most tape drives is 126.
.TP
\f4c\f1
Cartridge.
Use a cartridge instead of the standard
half-inch reel.
This sets the density to 1000\s-1BPI\s0
and the blocking factor to 126.
The length is set to 425 feet.
This option is incompatible with the
\f4\-d\f1
option, unless you specify a density of
1000\s-1BPI\s0 with that option.
.TP
\f4\-d\f2 bpi\f1
Tape density.
The density of the tape, expressed in
.SM BPI\s0,
is taken from
.IR bpi .
This is used to keep a running tab on
the amount of tape used per reel.
The default density is 1600 except for
cartridge tape.
Unless a higher density is specified explicitly,
\f4ufsdump\f1
uses its default density \(em even if the tape drive
is capable of higher-density operation (for instance,
6250\s-1BPI\s0).
Note:
the density specified should correspond to the
density of the tape device being used, or
\f4ufsdump\f1
will not be able to handle end-of-tape properly. 
.TP
\f4\-f\f2 dump-file\f1
Dump file. 
Use
.I dump-file
as the file to dump to, instead of
\f4/dev/rmt8.\f1
If
.I dump-file
is specified as
\f1\f4\-\f1,
dump to the standard output.
.TP
\f4\-n\f1
Notify all operators in the operator group
that \f4ufsdump\f1
requires attention by sending messages to their terminals,
in a manner similar to that used by the \f4wall\f1 command.
.br 
.ne 10
.TP
\f4\-s\f2 size\f1
Specify the
.I size
of the volume being dumped to.
When the specified size is reached,
\f4ufsdump\f1
waits for you to change the volume.
\f4ufsdump\f1
interprets the specified size as the length in
feet for tapes and cartridges, and 
as the number of 1024-byte blocks for diskettes.
The following are defaults:
.RS
.RS
.TP 12
cartridge 
.PD 0
425 feet
.TP
diskette
1422 blocks (Corresponds
to a 1.44 Mb diskette, with one cylinder reserved
for bad block information.)
.PD
.RE
.RE
.TP
\f4\-t\f2 tracks\f1
Specify the number of tracks for a cartridge tape.
The default is 9 tracks.  
The \f4\-t\f1 option 
is not compatible with 
the \f4\-D\f1 option.
.TP
\f4\-u\f1
Update the dump record.
Add an entry to the file
\f4/etc/dumpdates,\f1
for each filesystem successfully dumped that
includes the filesystem name, date, and dump level.
This file can be edited by the super-user.
.TP
\f4\-w\f1
List the file systems that need backing up.
This information is gleaned from the files
\f4/etc/dumpdates\f1 and \f4/etc/vfstab\f1.
When the \f4\-w\f1 option is used,
all other options are ignored.
After reporting,
\f4ufsdump\f1 exits immediately.
.TP
\f4W\f1
Similar to the
\f4\-w\f1 option,
except that the \f4\-W\f1 option
includes all file systems that appear in
\f4/etc/dumpdates,\f1
along with information about their most recent dump
dates and levels.
Filesystems that need backing up are highlighted.
.SH NOTES
.LP
Fewer than 32 read errors on the filesystem are
ignored.
.LP
Each reel requires a new process, so parent
processes for reels already written just hang around
until the entire tape is written.
.LP
It is recommended that incremental dumps also be
performed with
the system running in single-user mode.

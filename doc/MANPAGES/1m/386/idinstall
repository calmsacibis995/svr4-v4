.SH NAME
\f4idinstall\f1 \- add, delete, update, or get device driver configuration data
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/etc/conf/bin/idinstall\f1
\-[\f4adug\f1] [\f4\-e\f1] \-[\f4msoptnirhcl\f1] \f2dev_name\f1
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The
\f4idinstall\f1
command is called by a Driver Software Package (DSP) Install script or Remove
script to
Add (\f4\-a\f1),  Delete (\f4\-d\f1),
Update (\f4\-u\f1), or Get (\f4\-g\f1) device driver
configuration data. 
\f4idinstall\f1
expects to find driver component files in the current directory.
When components are installed or updated,
they are moved or appended to files in the
\f4/etc/conf\f1
directory and then deleted from the current directory unless the
\f4\-k\f1
flag is used.
The options for the command are as follows:

.RE
.P
In the simplest case of installing a new DSP,
the command syntax used by the DSP's Install
script should be
\f4idinstall \-a \f2dev_name\f1.
In this case the command will require and install a Driver.o, 
Master and System entry,
and optionally install the Space.c, Stubs.c, Node, Init, Rc, Shutdown,
Mfsys, and Sfsys components if
those modules are present in the current directory.
.P
The Driver.o, Space.c, and Stubs.c files are moved to a directory in
\f4/etc/conf/pack.d\f1.
The 
\f2dev_name\f1
is passed as an argument, which is used as
the directory name. The remaining components are stored in the corresponding
directories under
\f4/etc/conf\f1
in a file whose name is
.I dev_name.
For example, the Node file would be moved to
\f4/etc/conf/node.d/dev_name\f1.
.P
The
\f4idinstall \-m\f1
usage provides an interface to the 
\f4idmaster\f1
command which will add, delete, and update
\f4mdevice\f1
file entries using a Master
file from the local directory. An interface is provided here so that driver
writers have a consistent interface to install any DSP component.
.P
As stated above, driver writers will generally use only the
\f4idinstall \-a\f1 \f2dev_name\f1
form of the command. Other options of
\f4idinstall\f1
are provided to allow an Update DSP (i.e., one that replaces an existing
device driver component) to be
installed, and to support installation of multiple controller boards
of the same type.
.P
If the call to
\f4idinstall\f1
uses the
\f4\-u\f1
(update) option, it will:
.sp .4v
.RS 5
overlay the files of the old DSP with the files of the new DSP.
.sp .4v
invoke the
\f4idmaster\f1
command with the 'update' option if a Master module is part of the new DSP.
.RE
.P
\f4idinstall\f1
also does a verification that enough free disk space is available
to start the reconfiguration process. This is done by calling the
\f4idspace\f1
command.
\f4idinstall\f1
will fail if insufficient space exists, and exit with a non-zero return code. The
\f4\-e\f1
option bypasses this check.
.P
This version of UNIX Supports Multiple Major numbers per
device.  For the case of a DSP package where \f4idinstall\f1 is
invoked by the installation software in the DSP, the range
specification will be  used.  The range "3.6" will mean four major
numbers are being requested.  The \f2ID\f1 Software will then
look for the first four available (consecutive) major
numbers.
.P
If a driver supports both block and charcter I/O both block
and character majors are assigned by \f4idinstall\f1.  These
major numbers do not have to be the same.  For SCSI developers
who require them to be the same, a new field '\f4v\f1' has to
be added to the third field of the master file.
.P
\f4idinstall\f1
makes a record of the last device installed in a file 
(\f4/etc/.last_dev_add\f1),
and saves all removed files from the last delete operation in a directory
\f4(/etc/.last_dev_del)\f1.
These files are recovered by
\f4/etc/conf/bin/idmkenv\f1
whenever it is determined that a system reconfiguration was aborted due to
a power failure or unexpected system reboot.
.SH "ERROR MESSAGES"
An exit value of zero indicates success. If an error was encountered,
\f4idinstall\f1
will exit with a non-zero value, and report an error message.
All error messages are designed to be self-explanatory.
Typical error message that can be generated
by
\f4idinstall\f1
are as follows:
.sp .4v
.RS 5
\f4Device package already exists.\f1
.br
\f4Cannot make the driver package directory.\f1
.br
\f4Cannot remove driver package directory.\f1
.br
\f4Local directory does not contain a Driver object (Driver.o) file.\f1

\f4Local directory does not contain a Master file.\f1

\f4Local directory does not contain a System file.\f1

\f4Cannot remove driver entry.\f1

.SH NAME
\f4vtgetty\f1 \- sets terminal type, modes, speed, and line
discipline.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/etc/vtgetty\f1\0[\|\f4-h\f1\|]\0[\|\f4-t\f1\|\f2timeout\f1\|]\0\f2line\f1\0[\0[\|\f2speed\f1[\|\f2type\f1\0[\|\f2linedisc\f1\|]\|]\|]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4vtgetty\f1 command is a program invoked by
\f4init\f1(1M).  It is the second process in the series
(\f4init-vtgetty-getty-login-shell\f1) that passes its
arguments and executes \f4/etc/getty\f1.  The \f4/etc/getty\f1
process will ultimately connect a user with the UNIX system.
\f4vtgetty\f1 can be executed only by the super-user (a process with the
user-ID of root).
.P
The command options are identical to those of \f4getty\f1(1M).
.P
Initially, \f4vtgetty\f1 opens the device and determines if
any virtual terminals (vts) are open for that device.  If
there are active vts, the user will be prompted to determine
if the vts should be closed automatically or manually when the
user logs out.
.P
If the automatic option is selected, \f4vtgetty\f1 will send
the signals, \f4SIGHUP\f1 and \f4SIGTERM\f1, to each open vt.
.P
It will then wait 3 seconds and send a \f4SIGKILL\f1 signal to
the vts to ensure that all the vts are terminated.
.P
If the manual closure option is selected, the highest numbered
vt will be activated and the user can manually close the vt.
This will be repeated until all open vts are manually closed.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
\f4vtgetty\f1 will fail under the following conditions:
.sp
	If there is no memory available.
.br
	If it cannot open the device it was given.
.br
	If it cannot convert from a file descriptor to a file pointer.
.br
	If it cannot get the file status [\f4stat\f1(2)] of the device it was given.
.br
	If an \f4ioctl\f1(2) call fails.

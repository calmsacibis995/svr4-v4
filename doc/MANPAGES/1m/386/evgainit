.SH NAME
\f4evgainit\f1 \- Extended VGA keyboard/display driver initialization
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4evgainit\f1 \f2card-type\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4evgainit\f1 is used to initialize the keyboard/display driver
(see the \f4keyboard\f1(7) manual page) 
if extended VGA graphics modes are being used on certain video cards.
.P
The keyboard/display driver provides the interface to the 
video card.
\f4evgainit\f1 informs the keyboard/display driver which video
card is installed and should be rerun each time the system
is booted.
.P
In many cases the keyboard/display driver can determine which card is
being used and therefore this command need not be run.
For example, you don't need to run \f4evgainit\f1 for the following cards:
.P
.in .5i
AT&T VDC 400, VDC 600, or VDC 750.
.sp .25
Any card that doesn't have extended VGA capability (i.e. 800x600 pixels).
.sp .25
Any card that is only VGA (640x480 pixels) or EGA (640x350 pixels).
.sp .25
Any extended VGA cards (listed below) that will not be set to
graphics modes with resolutions greater than 640x480 pixels.
.in -.5i
.P
\f4evgainit\f1 must be run, however, for the following cards before
attempting to use resolutions greater than 640x480 pixels.
The following list shows the \f2card-type\f1
argument value that should be used for each video card:

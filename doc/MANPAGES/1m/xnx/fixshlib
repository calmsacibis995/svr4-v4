.SH NAME
fixshlib \- alters executables to call SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2-compatible libnsl
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4fixshlib\fP \f2filename\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
SCO applications installed with the custom command [see custom(1M) in
the \f2System Administrator's Reference Manual\fP]
will automatically have references to \f4libnsl\fP changed
to reference an SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2-compatible \f4libnsl\fP
(\f4shlib/libNSL_s\fP).
However, you may need to run \f4fixshlib\fP on any SCO UNIX System V/386
Release 3.2 application that is not installed using the \f4custom\fP
command.
The \f4fixshlib\fP command will alter the executable to use the
SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2-compatible \f4libnsl\fP.
.P
When executing the command,
\f2filename\fP is the pathname of the executable to be modified.
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
If \f4filename\fP is not a COFF format \f4a.out\fP executable, you will see
the following error message:
.RS
\f4unknown file type - possibly bad magic: Error 0\fP
.RE
.SH "SEE ALSO"
\f4custom\fP(1M) in the \f2System Administrator's Reference Manual\fP
.SH NOTES
Using the \f4fixshlib\fP command on a COFF executable built or intended to
run on non-SCO UNIX system implementations could cause the executable to fail.
If your executable fails because of this, there is no way to restore the
executable.
The associated application should be re-installed.

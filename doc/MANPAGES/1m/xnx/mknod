.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4mknod\fP
makes a directory entry for a special file.
.PP
In the first case, \f2name\fP is the special file to be created.
The second argument is either \f4b\fP to indicate a block-type special file or 
\f4c\fP to indicate a character-type.
The last two arguments are
numbers specifying the
.I major\^
and 
.I minor\^
device numbers;
these may be either decimal or octal [see \f4mknod(2)\fP in the \f2Programmer's
Reference Manual\fP for information on minor device number values].
The assignment of major device numbers is specific to each system.
You must be the super-user to use this form of the command.
.PP
The second case is used to create a FIFO (named pipe).
.PP
The third case is used to create XENIX shared memory handles.
.PP
The fourth case is used to create XENIX semaphore handles.
.SH "NOTES"
If \f4mknod\f1 is used to create a device in a remote directory
(Remote File Sharing), the major and minor device numbers
are interpreted by the server.

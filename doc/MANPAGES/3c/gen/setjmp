.SH NAME
\f4setjmp\f1, \f4longjmp\f1 \- non-local goto
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\f4#include <setjmp.h>\f1
.PP
\f4int setjmp (jmp_buf env);\f1
.PP
\f4void longjmp (jmp_buf env, int val);\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions are useful for dealing with errors 
and interrupts encountered in
a low-level subroutine of a program.
.PP
\f4setjmp\fP
saves its stack environment in
\f4env\fP
(whose type,
.IR jmp_buf ,
is defined in the
\f4<setjmp.h>\f1\^
header file) for later use by
\f4longjmp\fP.
It returns the value 0.
.PP
\f4longjmp\fP
restores the environment saved by the last call of
\f4setjmp\fP
with the corresponding
\f4env\fP
argument.
After
\f4longjmp\fP
is completed, program execution
continues as if the corresponding call of 
\f4setjmp\fP
had just returned the value
\f4val\fP.
(The caller of 
\f4setjmp\fP
must not have returned in the interim.)
\f4longjmp\fP
cannot cause
\f4setjmp\fP
to return the value 0.  If
\f4longjmp\fP
is invoked with a second argument of 0,
\f4setjmp\fP
will return 1.
At the time of the second return from
\f4setjmp\fP,
all external and static variables have
values as of the time
\f4longjmp\fP
is called (see example).
The values of register and automatic variables are undefined.
.PP
Register or automatic variables whose value must
be relied upon must be declared as \f4volatile\f1.
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
\f4\&#include <stdio.h>
\f4\&#include <stdlib.h>
\f4\&#include <setjmp.h>
.sp
jmp_buf env;
int i = 0;
main ()
{
    void exit();

    if(setjmp(env) != 0) {
       (void) printf("value of i on 2nd return from setjmp: %d\\n", i);
       exit(0);
    }
    (void) printf("value of i on 1st return from setjmp: %d\\n", i);
    i = 1;
    g();
    /\(** NOTREACHED \(**/
}
g()
{
    longjmp(env, 1);
    /\(** NOTREACHED \(**/
}\f1
.fi
.PP
If the \f4a.out\fP resulting from this C language code is run, the 
output will be:
.RS
.sp .5
\f4value of i on 1st return from setjmp:\^0 \f1
.sp .5
\f4value of i on 2nd return from setjmp:\^1 \f1
.RE
.SH SEE ALSO
\f4signal\fP(2), \f4sigsetjmp\f1(3C).
.SH NOTES
If
\f4longjmp\fP
is called even though
\f4env\fP
was never primed by a call to
\f4setjmp\fP,
or when the last such call was in a function that has since returned,
absolute chaos is guaranteed.

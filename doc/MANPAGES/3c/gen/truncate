.SH NAME
\f4truncate\f1, \f4ftruncate\f1 \- set a file to a specified length
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4#include <unistd.h>\f1
.PP
\f4int truncate (const char \(**path, off_t length);\f1
.PP
\f4int ftruncate (int fildes, off_t length);\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX  truncate  ""  \f4truncate\f1
.IX  "file system"  truncate  ""  \f4truncate\f1
.IX  ftruncate  ""  \f4ftruncate\f1
.IX  "file system"  ftruncate  ""  \f4ftruncate\f1
The file whose name is given by \f2path\f1 or referenced by the
descriptor \f2fildes\f1 has its size set to \f2length\f1 bytes.
.P
If the file was previously longer than \f2length\f1,
bytes past \f2length\f1 will no longer be accessible.
If it was shorter, bytes from the
.SM EOF
before the call to the
.SM EOF
after the call will be read in as zeros.
The effective user
.SM ID
of the process must have write permission for
the file, and 
for \f4ftruncate\f1 the file must be open for writing.
.P
\f4truncate\f1 fails if one or more of the following are true:
.TP 18
\f4EACCES\fP
Search permission is denied on a component of the path prefix.
.TP
\f4EACCES\fP
Write permission is denied for the file referred to by
.IR path .
.TP
\f4EFAULT\fP
.I path
points outside the process's allocated address space.
.TP
\f4EINTR\fP
A signal was caught during execution of the \f4truncate\f1 routine.
.TP
\f4EINVAL\fP
.I path 
is not an ordinary file.
.TP
\f4EIO\fP
An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.
.TP
\f4EISDIR\fP
The file referred to by
.I path
is a directory.
.TP
\f4ELOOP\fP
Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating
.IR path .
.TP
\f4EMFILE\fP
The maximum number of file descriptors available to the process has been
reached.
.TP
\f4EMULTIHOP\fP 
Components of
.I path
require hopping to multiple remote machines
and file system type does not allow it.
.TP
\f4ENAMETOOLONG\fP
The length of a \f2path\f1 component
exceeds {NAME_MAX} characters,
or the length of
.I path
exceeds {PATH_MAX} characters.
.TP
\f4ENFILE\fP
Could not allocate any more space for the system file table.
.TP
\f4ENOENT\fP
Either a component of the path prefix or the file referred to by
.I path
does not exist.
.TP
\f4ENOLINK\fP 
.I path 
points to a remote machine and the link to that machine is no longer
active.
.TP
\f4ENOTDIR\fP
A component of the path prefix of
.I path
is not a directory.
.TP
\f4EROFS\fP
The file referred to by
.I path
resides on a read-only file system.
.TP
\f4ETXTBSY\fP
The file referred to by
.I path
is a pure procedure (shared text) file that is being executed.
.P
\f4ftruncate\fP
fails if one or more of the following are true:
.TP 18
\f4EAGAIN\fP
The file exists, mandatory file/record locking is set, and there are
outstanding record locks on the file [see \f4chmod\fP(2)].
.TP
\f4EBADF\fP
.I fildes
is not a file descriptor open for writing.
.TP
\f4EINTR\fP
A signal was caught during execution of the \f4ftruncate\f1 routine.
.TP
\f4EIO\fP
An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.
.TP
\f4ENOLINK\fP 
.I fildes
points to a remote machine and the link to that machine is no longer
active.
.TP
\f4EINVAL\fP
.I fildes
does not correspond to an ordinary file.

\f4fcntl\fP(2), \f4open\fP(2)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.
Otherwise, a value of \-1 is returned and
\f4errno\fP
is set to indicate the error.

.SH NAME
\f4clock\f1 \- report \s-1CPU\s+1 time used
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4#include <time.h>\f1
.PP
\f4clock_t clock (void);\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4clock\fP
returns the amount of \s-1CPU\s+1 time (in microseconds) used since the
first call to
\f4clock\fP
in the calling process.
The time reported is the sum of the user and system times of the
calling process and its terminated child processes for which it has executed
the \f4wait\fP system call, the
\f4pclose\fP function,
or the
\f4system\fP function.
.PP
Dividing the value returned by
\f4clock\fP
by the constant \f4CLOCKS_PER_SEC\fP,
defined in the
\f4time.h\f1 header file,
will give the time in seconds. 
.PP
The resolution of the clock is 10 milliseconds on \s-1AT&T 3B\s+1 computers.
.SH SEE ALSO
\f4times\fP(2), \f4wait\fP(2), \f4popen\fP(3S), \f4system\fP(3S)
.SH NOTES
The value returned by
\f4clock\fP
is defined in microseconds for compatibility with systems that have
\s-1CPU\s+1 clocks with much higher resolution.
Because of this, the value returned
will wrap around after accumulating
only 2147 seconds of \s-1CPU\s+1 time (about 36 minutes).
If the process time used is not available or cannot be 
represented, clock returns the value \f4(clock_t)\-1\fP.

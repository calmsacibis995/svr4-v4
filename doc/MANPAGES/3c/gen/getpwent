.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4#include <pwd.h>\f1
.PP
\f4struct passwd \(**getpwent (void);\f1
.PP
\f4struct passwd \(**getpwuid (uid_t uid);\f1

\f4struct passwd \(**fgetpwent (FILE \(**f);\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4getpwent\fP,
\f4getpwuid\fP,
and
\f4getpwnam\fP
each returns a pointer to an object with the
following structure
containing the broken-out
fields of a line in the
\f4/etc/passwd\f1
file.
Each line in the file
contains a \f4passwd\fP structure, declared in the
\f4pwd.h\fP
header file:
.RS
.PP
.nf
\f4struct passwd {
	char	\(**pw_name;
	char	\(**pw_passwd;
	uid_t	pw_uid;
	gid_t	pw_gid;
	char	\(**pw_age;
	char	\(**pw_comment;
	char	\(**pw_gecos;
	char	\(**pw_dir;
	char	\(**pw_shell;
};\f1
.fi
.RE
.PP
\f4getpwent\fP
when first called returns a pointer to the first \f4passwd\f1 structure in the file;
thereafter, it returns a pointer to the next \f4passwd\f1 structure in the file;
so successive calls can
be used to search the entire file.
\f4getpwuid\fP
searches from the beginning of the file until a numerical user id matching
.I uid\^
is found and
returns a pointer to the particular structure in which it was found.
\f4getpwnam\fP
searches from the beginning of the
file until a login name matching
.I name\^
is found, and returns a pointer to the particular structure
in which it was found.
If an end-of-file or an error
is encountered on reading, these functions return a
null pointer.
.PP
A call to
\f4setpwent\fP
has the effect of rewinding
the password file
to allow
repeated searches.
\f4endpwent\fP
may be called to
close the password file
when processing is complete.
.PP
\f4fgetpwent\fP
returns a pointer to the next \f4passwd\f1 structure in the stream
.IR f ,
which matches the format of
\f4/etc/passwd\f1.
.SH FILES

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
\f4getpwent\f1,
\f4getpwnid\f1,
\f4getpwnam\f1,
and
\f4fgetpwent\f1
return a null pointer
on \f4EOF\f1 or error.

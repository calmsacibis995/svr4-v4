.SH NAME
\f4getvfsent\fP, \f4getvfsfile\fP, \f4getvfsspec\fP, \f4getvfsany\fP \- get \f4vfstab\fP file entry
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4#include <stdio.h>\fP
.br
\f4#include <sys/vfstab.h>\fP
.PP
\f4int getvfsent (FILE \(**fp, struct vfstab \(**vp);
.PP
\f4int getvfsfile (FILE \(**fp, struct vfstab \(**vp, char \(**file);
.PP
\f4int getvfsspec (FILE \(**fp, struct vfstab \(**vp, char \(**spec);
.PP
\f4int getvfsany (FILE \(**fp, struct vfstab \(**vp, struct vfstab \(**vref);
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4getvfsent\fP,
\f4getvfsfile\fP,
\f4getvfsspec\fP,
and
\f4getvfsany\fP
each fill in the structure pointed to by \f2vp\f1 with
the broken-out
fields of a line in the file \f2fp\fP.
Each line in the file
contains a \f4vfstab\fP structure, declared in the
\f4sys/vfstab.h\fP
header file:
.RS
.PP
.nf
\f4
	char	\(**vfs_special;
	char	\(**vfs_fsckdev;
	char	\(**vfs_mountp;
	char	\(**vfs_fstype;
	char	\(**vfs_fsckpass;
	char	\(**vfs_automnt;
	char	\(**vfs_mntopts;

The fields have meanings described in
\f4vfstab\fP(4).
.PP
\f4getvfsent\fP
fills \f2vp\fP with the next \f4vfstab\fP structure in \f2fp\fP
so successive calls can be used to search the entire file.
\f4getvfsfile\fP
searches the file referenced by
\f2fp\fP
until a mount point matching
\f2file\fP
is found and
fills
\f2vp\fP
with the fields from the line in the file.
\f4getvfsspec\fP
searches the file referenced by
\f2fp\fP
until a special device matching
\f2spec\fP
is found and
fills
\f2vp\fP
with the fields from the line in the file.
\f2spec\fP
will try to match on device type (block or character special)
and major and minor device numbers.
If it cannot match in this manner, then it compares the strings.
\f4getvfsany\fP
searches the file referenced by
\f2fp\fP
until a match is found between a line in the file and
\f2vref\fP.
\f2vref\fP
matches the line if all
non-null
entries in
\f2vref\fP
match the corresponding fields in the file.
.PP
Note that these routines do not open, close, or rewind the file.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
If the next entry is successfully read by
\f4getvfsent\fP
or a match is found with
\f4getvfsfile\fP,
\f4getvfsspec\fP,
or
\f4getvfsany\fP,
0 is returned.
If an end-of-file
is encountered on reading, these functions return \-1.
If an error is encountered, a value greater than 0 is returned.
The possible error values are:
.TP 20
\f4VFS_TOOLONG\fP
A line in the file exceeded the internal buffer size of
\f4VFS_LINE_MAX\fP.
.TP 20
\f4VFS_TOOMANY\fP
A line in the file contains too many fields.
.TP 20
\f4VFS_TOOFEW\fP
A line in the file contains too few fields.
.SH NOTES
The members of the
\f4vfstab\fP
structure point to information contained in a static area,
so it must be copied if it is
to be saved.

.CH "The Documentation Tape" 2
.H 1 "Introduction"
The UNIX\(rg System V/386 Release 4 Version 4 Source Code Product
Machine Readable Documentation tape (the SCP MRD tape) is part of your SCP product.
The tape contains a subset of the full UNIX System V/386
Release 4 Version 4 documentation set.
It contains manual pages and porting documents, but
does not contain guide material, i.e., procedures or tutorials.
See \*(gb for a list of the titles on the tape.
(If you are interested in obtaining a full set of the
UNIX documentation, see the
.BT "Technology-File Mapping Guide"
for a description of the Documentation Reproduction
Provision (DRP) tape, which contains the full
document set (except for the proprietary documents).
.P
This chapter explains how to produce hard-copy documents from the
MRD tape, which is either a 6250 bpi nine-track tape,
or a 60 MB cartridge tape.
Creating hard copy involves the following steps:
.BL
.LI
copying the documentation source files from tape to hard disk
.LI
installing DOCTOOLS, a tool kit for formatting the documents
.LI
formatting and printing the documents
.LE
.H 2 "Prerequisites"
In order to format documents, you must have already installed the
DOCUMENTER'S WORKBENCH \*(Tm (DWB), Release 2, or higher.
This software is not part of the source code product, but it is
available from UNIX System Laboratories or AT&T.
.P
If you require PostScript\(rg language support,
it is available from either of the following sources:
.BL
.LI
DWB Version 3.0 (or higher) \(em with DWB Version 3.0 (or higher), you can
run UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 (or higher) and have PostScript support.
.LI
UNIX System V Release 4 \(em with UNIX System V/386
Release 4, you can run DWB Release 2 (or higher) and have PostScript support.
.LE
.H 1 "Copying Documentation Files from the Tape"
You will need approximately 25 MB of disk space to
install the documentation on tape.
To copy the files from the documentation tape to the hard disk:
.AL
.LI
Enter
.DS UI
\f4mkdir\fP \f2newdirectory\fP
.DE
to create a directory for the documentation set.
.LI
Enter
.DS UI
\f4cd\fP \f2newdirectory\fP
.DE
to change directory to the directory just created.
.LI
Mount the tape on the tape drive.
.LI
Enter
.DS UI
\f4su\fP \f2login\fP
.DE
where \f2login\fP is the login of the person
owning the directory for the documentation set.
(This ensures that the person owning the directory where the documentation is
loaded will own the files, and therefore be able to change permisions as needed.)
.LI
Enter
.DS UI
\f4cpio -icvmBd < \f26250 bpi or cartridge tape device name\f1
.DE
For example, the actual command might be something like:
.DS UI
\f4cpio -icvmBd < \(sldev\(slrmt\(slc0s0\f1
.DE
When \f4cpio\f1 has completed, you will find
a \f4readme\f1 file and the directories
\f4BUILDINS\f1,
\f4CUI\f1,
\f4DDIREFMAN\f1,
\f4DOCNOTES\f1,
\f4DOCTOOLS\f1,
\f4FMGUIDE\f1,
\f4FSTYPES\f1,
\f4INSTGUIDE\f1,
\f4ISDG\fP,
\f4KERNPORT\f1,
\f4MBREFMAN\f1,
\f4MBTAI\f1,
\f4MIGCOMPAT\fP,
\f4NI\f1,
\f4NUAG\f1,
\f4PRM\f1,
\f4PRODOVR\f1,
\f4RMF\fP,
\f4SARM\f1,
\f4SCSI\f1,
\f4SOFTNOTES\f1,
\f4STRM\f1,
\f4STYLE\fP
and
\f4URM\f1,
in your current directory.
.LE
.br
.NE 3
.SK
A list of all file names on the Source Code Product MRD tape
is provided in a file named \f4tape.contents\f1.
This file is installed in the top directory into which you
copied the documentation source files.
.P
\*(gb lists the directory names and
the documents that are in each directory.
The notation \f2``(Manual Pages)\f1'' to the right of the title
indicates that the directory contains only
manual pages and that the guide material, permuted
indexes, and tables of contents for the document
have been deliberately omitted from the tape.
These sections plus the manual pages can be found in their entirety on the
Documentation Reproduction Provision (DRP) tape, which is available separately.

.H 1 "Installing DOCTOOLS"
DOCTOOLS is a tool kit for formatting the SCP documents.
This section describes and defines the environment required
to modify and change Release 4 documentation using DOCTOOLS and PostScript.
For additional information on DOCTOOLS, consult the
.BT "Documenter's Toolset User's Guide,"
which is
found in the \f4DOCTOOLS\f1 directory.
The \f4DOCTOOLS\f1 directory contains both the documentation
and software for DOCTOOLS.
.P
.AB N
If, during a previous release of UNIX System V/386 Release 4
you have already installed DOCTOOLS Release 1,
you do not need to reinstall it now.
Skip forward to the section
.ST "Using DOCTOOLS to Print Documents."
.AC
.P
To install DOCTOOLS, follow the steps outlined below.
.AL
.LI
Edit the
.UI shells/defs.h.src
file to tell DOCTOOLS about your
local printers and other destinations.
Follow the examples in the file.
You will need to know how to send jobs to the printers
on your system to define the variables.
If you know the command line syntax, such as:
.DS "" UI
tbl \f2file\fP | troff -Tpost -mm | dpost | lp -opost -dprinter1
.DE
you can edit
.UI defs.h.src.
If you do not know this information,
get the information from your system administrator.
.P
If you have a pre-1.0 release of DOCTOOLS, you can copy
your existing
.UI defs.h
to
.UI shells/defs.h.src.
Change any occurrences of
.UI MACH
to
.UI MACHINE .
Note, however, that some destinations included in
.UI defs.h.src
are meant to be location independent.
These are:
.VL 0.75i 0.5i
.LI proof UI
Proof files on a DMD terminal.
.LI null UI
Process files to check for errors or to generate tables of contents.
.LI post UI
Create PostScript language files.
.LI archive UI
Archive files with
.UI cpio .
.LE
You may need to make some minor adjustments to these
definitions to accommodate your local environment.
.LI
You may need to edit
.UI macros/macros.h.src .
This file contains the font specific information
and other tunable variables, like the print date that
appears at the bottom of manual pages.
.AB N
Unlike
.UI defs.h.src ,
the
.UI macros.h.src
file is not compatible with
previous versions of DOCTOOLS.
.AC
The
.UI macros.h.src
file holds definitions, in the form
of
.UI troff
defined strings, for much of the typography
produced by DOCTOOLS.
You can change the definitions
to change the style created by the markup in the text
files, such as the fonts used for user input text,
computer output text, and program code text (see
the macros for
.UI \&.UI ,
.UI \&.CO ,
and
.UI \&.PC
in the 
\f2Documenter's Toolset User's Guide\fP).
Try using it as is.
If you have font related
errors, then edit
.UI macros.h.src
and reinstall.
.P
Follow the comments in the
.UI macros.h.src
file and make changes carefully.
.LI
You will need to set the variables described in
.UI Makefile .
.UI Makefile
contains the variables that set where the tools
are installed as well as set necessary variables
within some of the files themselves.
At a minimum, you need to name a bin directory
.UI (BINDIR)
where you want the executables kept, and a library directory
.UI (LIBDIR)
where you want the support files kept, such as the macro
files.
Follow the comments in
.UI Makefile .
.P
Once you have made these changes, type
.UI
make install
.SF
in this directory and watch for any error messages.
.LE
.H 2 "Memorandum Macros (MM)"
If you plan to print memoranda with DOCTOOLS,
copy or link your local memorandum macro file to
a file called
.UI mmt
in
.UI LIBDIR
(defined in
.UI Makefile ).
Make sure any sourced (\f4.so\f1) files in
.UI mmt
are also
in
.UI LIBDIR ,
or make sure that they can be successfully read
in from where they are kept.
.H 2 "PostScript Language and DOCTOOLS Software"
The Release 4 software tape includes a set of PostScript language tools
designed to work with DOCUMENTER'S WORKBENCH, including a
.UI troff
postprocessor called
.UI dpost.
\f4dpost\f1 translates \f4troff\f1 output into PostScript.
This software allows you to use the
.UI \&.BP/.EP
macros described in the
``Documenter's Toolset User's Guide.''
The 
.UI \&.BP
(Begin PostScript) and
.UI \&.EP
(End PostScript) macros
enable you to integrate PostScript language graphics files
into your source text files.
\f4dpost\f1 also allows DOCTOOLS to write PostScript language code to shade
the icons, screens, and hardkeys in your guide files.
.P
The PostScript language software is on your Release 4
software tape in the
.UI /usr/src/cmd/lp/postscript
directory.
You will see references in some of the entries in the
.UI defs.h.src
file to
.UI \-Tpost
and
.UI dpost .
These entries
are designed to work with this PostScript language software.
.H 1 "Using DOCTOOLS to Print Documents"
Once you have installed DOCTOOLS, you can print individual files by entering
.DS I UI
\f4format -d\f2printer\fP \f2file1\fP \f2file2\f1 . . .
.DE
To generate table-of-contents files, use the \f4-c\f1 option to \f4format\f1,
for example:
.DS I UI
\f4format -c -d\f2printer\fP \f2file1\fP \f2file2\f1 . . .
.DE
The \f4-c\f1 option creates files in the form of
\f4C\f2file\f1.
These files include
table-of-contents information as well as indexing information.
.AB N
If you have already installed an earlier version of Release 4 SCP
documents, you do not need to reprint the entire set of SCP
documents, but only those documents that have changed since Version 3.
An asterisk in the left column of Table 2-1
indicates that a document has changed since Version 3 of Release 4.
.AC
.P
.H 2 "Printing Documents from Collection Files"
Once you have verified that the tools for printing are functioning, you can
print an entire document in a single step.
This is done by using a collection file.
A collection file is a list of all the files that make up a
single document in printing order.
.AB C
Before you attempt to use a collection file, make sure you can
process more than a single file at a time, and that you really want to print
all the files listed in the provided collection file.
Where appropriate, collection files include table-of-contents and indexes,
which list page numbers that may not be correct when you
format the files locally.
For page numbers to be accurate in your printing environment, you may need
to generate the table-of-contents files and index files locally.
This can be done as described above with the \f4-c\f1 option.
See the
.BT "Documenter's Toolset User's Guide"
for a complete description
of collection files and how to use them, as well as more information
on how to create table-of-contents files and index files.
.AC
.H 2 "Example"

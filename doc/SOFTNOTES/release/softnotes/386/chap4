.H 1 "Networking Notes"
.IX istart UNIX System V/386 Release 4, networking notes
.H 2 "TCP/IP (DARPA Internet Protocol Suite)
.H 3 "rlogin command"
.MR ul90-32013
\f4rlogin\f1 with the \f4-L\f1 option is used to run in literal
output mode, which includes ignoring the parity bit.
By default, the remote login session is not started igoring the parity bit,
however.  To get it, type \f4stty ignpar\f1 once you have a
successful remote log in.
.H 3 "Domain Name Service (DNS)"
.IX TCP/IP, \f4tlp\fP and \f4telnet\fP and using DNS
.IX Domain Name Service (DNS), using \f4tlp\fP and \f4telnet\fP
The default Internet services, including 
.UI ftp 
and 
.UI telnet , 
are not compiled to use the Domain Name Service.  For DNS, the
programs must be compiled with the following libraries, in
the following order: 
.UI 
.BL
.LI
-lresolv 
.LI
-lnsl
.LI
-lsocket
.LE
.H 3 "Pseudo-terminals"
.IX TCP/IP, pseudo terminal configuration
Pseudo-terminals must be configured for TCP/IP services, such
as 
\f4telnet\f1 and \f4rlogin\f1, to work.
These may be selected when the NSU package is installed.
.H 2 "NFS"
.H 3 "Use NFS bg in /etc/vfstab"
NFS file systems specified in \f4/etc/vfstab\f1 should use
the \f4bg\f1 option to prevent the system
from hanging or looping at boot time when the
remote system is down.
.H 3 "unsharing advertised resources"
.MR "dm90-26479
The \f4unshareall\f1 command may not always unshare an
advertised resource. This problem is specific to
the NFS \f4unshare\f1 command.
.H 3 "Automounter"
.IX NFS, automounter and maps
.IX automounter, direct and indirect maps
Direct map automounters do not always clean up after themselves.
They may leave files that are symbolic links to automount daemon
mount points for which the automount daemon no longer exists.
Attempts to access these files will result in \f4server not
responding\f1 messages.  These files can only be removed by
unlinking them, then running \f4fsck\f1, or by rebooting and then 
removing any remaining links.  The only other workaround is 
to avoid using direct maps with the automounter.
.P
Note that the automount daemon for direct maps mounts itself
on the mountpoint specified in the map, while the automounter
for an indirect map mounts itself on the directory specified
as the root for the indirect mount, i.e., one level above the
mount point for the resource in the indirect map.
This can be misleading to the user because the 
user may not expect anything to be mounted above the 
mount point of the resource.
Because the daemon mounts itself there, the previous 
contents of the directory are covered for the duration of 
the life of the automounter.
As with all file system mount points, it is a good policy 
to use empty directories as automount root mount points.
.P
There is no entry in the \f4/etc/mnttab\f1 file corresponding to
the mount of the automount daemon on the automount root 
mount point.
Therefore, it is possible for a user attempting to mount a 
file system on a given mount point to get a \f4mount point 
busy\f1 message even though that directory is not 
noted in the \f4/etc/mnttab\f1 file as an existing mount
point.
.H 3 "sysadm Automount"
.MR dm90-34679
If you discontinue an nfs automount from \f4sysadm\f1, the entry is
removed from \f4/etc/vfstab\f1 instead of being turned off.  (The
way to turn off an nfs automount from \f4sysadm\f1 is \f4network_
services\f1, \f4remote_files\f1, \f4remote_resources\f1,
\f4unmount\f1, \f4nfs\f1, then select \f4yes\f1 to discontinue the
automount.)
The problem with removing this entry is that you may want to use
the \f4mount\f1(1M) command later to mount the resource.  If you
give \f4mount\f1 command partial information, it can use the
\f4/etc/vfstab\f1 entry to fill in the rest.
.H 3 "Lock Manager"
.IX NFS, deadlock detection
.IX deadlock, NFS lock manager
.MR "bl89-26139"
The lock manager does not always detect deadlock.
.H 3 "Loopback"
.IX istart \f4nfsd\fP
.IX NFS, interrupted read or write
If a large read or write operation to a loopback mount with 
\f4biod\f1's running is interrupted, some of 
the \f4nfsd\f1's can hang while waiting for the 
STREAMS code to free a STREAMS message block.
.IX iend \f4nfsd\fP
.H 3 "Secure NFS mount"
.IX Secure NFS, \f4mount\fP
If a secure NFS mount is interrupted while waiting for
the keyserver to respond, it is possible for the 
file system to be mounted, but without a corresponding entry put
in the \f4/etc/mnttab\f1 file.  This occurs because the signal will
not be handled until after the mount system call has succeeded
and returned to the \f4mount\f1 command.  The command process will then 
be killed before it writes to \f4/etc/mnttab\f1.
.H 3 "Transport Independence"
.IX NFS and workarounds
.IX NFS, transport independence
.IX NFS, multiple transports
NFS can run over multiple transports simultaneously, provided that:
.AL a
.LI
both the client and the server agree on the maximum
packet size for a given transport; or,
the \f4-o rsize=,wsize=\f1 options are given to the 
\f4mount\f1 command to reduce the read and write sizes to a value
small enough for both machines (the minimum of the
packet sizes of the two machines' transports).
Note that the read and write transfer sizes should be
about 430 bytes smaller than the transport's packet
size to allow for RPC headers.
.LI
the transport can accept packets of at least a minimum
size, of approximately 1400 bytes.
.LE
.P
The NFS daemon (\f4nfsd\f1) does not listen on a specified address
over transports other than UDP.  Therefore, if the \f4nfsd\f1's are
killed and restarted it is likely that the new \f4nfsd\f1 will
listen on an entirely different address causing
any previously existing mounts to fail.
.P
The following are options to \f4nfsd\f1 that are not 
documented on the \f4nfsd\f1 manual page:

	\f4-a\f1		start \f4nfsd\f1's over all available connectionless transports

	\f4-p\f1 \f2protocol\f1	start \f4nfsd\f1's over the specified protocol

	\f4-t\f1 \f2device\f1 	start \f4nfsd\f1's for the transport specified by the given device 

.P
.IX \f4NETPATH\fP environment variable
If the NETPATH environment variable is set then at least one of 
the transports in the NETPATH path should be connectionless.
.H 3 "share Resources Command"
.IX istart \f4share_nfs\fP, read and write permissions
If a resource is shared with a \f4ro= list\f1 and a \f4root= list\f1,
any host that is on the \f4root= list\f1 will be given only read-only
access, regardless of whether that host is specified in the \f4ro=
list\f1, unless \f4rw\f1 is declared as the default, or 
the host is mentioned in a \f4rw= list\f1. 
The same is true if the resource is shared with \f4ro\f1
as the default. For example, the following \f4share\f1 commands will
give read-only permissions to \f4hostb\f1:
.P
.nf
	\f4share -F nfs -oro=hosta,root=hostb /var
.sp 1
	share -F nfs -oro,root=hostb /var\f1
.P
While the following will give read/write permissions to hostb:
.sp 1  
	\f4share -F nfs -oro=hosta,rw=hostb,root=hostb /var
.sp 1
	share -F nfs -oroot=hostb /var\f1
.br
.IX iend \f4share_nfs\fP, read and write permissions
.H 3  "Compatibility with UNIX V Release 3.2"
A NFS mount from SVR4 to a SVR3.2 system
running Lachman NFS 3.2.4 does not work.
If the repeating error message, \f4Authenticate error\f1,
is displayed on a SVR4 system, \f4root\f1 on that
system belongs to too many groups.
To mount a Lachman 3.2.4 system, \f4root\f1
must not belong to more than eight groups.
.P
The workaround is to edit the \f1/etc/groups\f1
file.
The line for root should only contain seven entries 
(including \f4root\f1).
.AB N
All users belong to group \f4other\fP even though it isn't 
specified in their line in the \f4/etc/groups\fP file.
.AC
.H 2 "RFS"
.IX RFS, compatibility with SVR4 implementation
Remote File Sharing (RFS) has been 
implemented as a file system type under VFS. 
Even though the new implementation fully 
supports the pre-SVR4 protocol, the new 
protocol has implications for compatibility 
and inter-operability with previous versions of RFS.
.P
Using \f4df\f1 with either the \f4-n\f1 or 
\f4-g\f1 options on a remote resource advertised from a 
pre-SVR4 system will give \f4unknown\f1 for the fstype.
.P
The \f4-c\f1 option to the \f4rfs\f1 specific \f4mount\f1 
command function is done by \f4-o\f1 nocaching.
.P
The \f4-d\f1 option for the \f4mount\f1 command is provided 
for compatibility, but its function is replaced by \f4-F rfs\f1, 
so the \f4-d\f1 will be removed in a future release.
.H 4 "Known Problems"
Facilities new to System V/386 Release 4 cannot be provided
by an older RFS server. Although a SVR4 
RFS client can create a dynamic shared library 
on a pre-SVR4 server, the shared library cannot 
be \f4mmap\f1ped from that server, because the pre-SVR4
protocol does not support file mapping
or paging. The \f4rename\f1 system call 
(used by the \f4mv\f1 command) is not fully 
supported between SVR4 clients and SVR3 servers.
An attempt to \f4rename\f1 a directory on an SVR3 server will
fail with the error \f4EISDIR\f1.
.P
RFS does not support \f4mmap\f1ping of character devices
or the allocation of remote swap files.
.P
Users and administrators of RFS clients and servers are reminded
that the interpretation of absolute symbolic links encountered
on the server can lead to unexpected results because they
are relative to the root directory of the client.
.P
.MR "bl90-12232
Setting up RFS via sysadm menus is not currently possible. 
The menu function for RFS is unpredictable and problematic.
.IX RFS, swap control
.H 3 "RFS root crontabs entry"
.MR ul90-33913
If you remove the Remote File Sharing Utilities package, an rfs
entry remains in the \f4root\f1 crontabs file
(\f4/var/spool/cron/crontabs/root\f1).  This cron entry will try to
run \f4/etc/rfs/rmnttry\f1 every 15 minutes to mount remote
resources.  Each failure will result in a mail message to root.  To
avoid the problem, remove the line containing the \f4rmnttry\f1
command from the \f4root\f1 crontabs file.
.H 3 "Swap Control"
Swap will not work over RFS (i.e., a swap device 
or file cannot be created on a resource mounted via RFS).  
If this is attempted, an \f4ENOSYS\f1 error will result. 
.H 2 "RFS: sysadm Initial Remote File Sharing Setup"
.MR "bl90-05813
When using the \f4add_nameserver\f1 - Adds Domain Name Servers
feature, there are two errors that you may encounter.
The first possible error message is:
.DS I UI
Name to Address Mapping has not been set up correctly.
Select the Name to Address Mapping Management task from the 
remote_files menu to setup Name to Address mapping.
.DE
If you are using TCP/IP as the transport provider, 
this may indicate that there is not a listen service 
in the \f4/etc/services\f1 file.
When using the \f4Name to Address Mapping\f1 to add the entry the
service will be listen and the port will be the port value
used to setup the listener.
The default listener port value for \f4tcp\f1 is ACE in 
hexadecimal which is 2766 in decimal.
The \f4Name to Address Mapping\f1 menu expects the value to 
be in decimal.
To get the listener address, you could 
execute \f4nlsadmin -l tcp\f1.
The port number will be the 5th through 8th numbers.
.AB N
RFS should be set up using command line input versus
OA&M menus.
.AC
.H 2 "Secure RPC"
.IX Secure RPC, with RFS
.IX RFS, Secure RPC
.H 3 "Secure RPC with RFS"
.IX Secure RPC, administrative files
The Secure RPC administrative files \f4/etc/masters\f1 and
\f4/etc/slaves\f1 contain the unames of RPC masters and slaves
respectively as documented in \f2Programmer's Guide: Networking
Interfaces\f1.
Note, however, that if RFS is used to share the files from the
masters or the slaves, then those entries in either file should
contain the RFS domain name for that master/server followed
by a dot (.) and the uname, i.e., \f4rfsdomain.uname\f1.
.P
One of the Secure RPC administrative tasks of 
a slave server is to share its \f4/etc\f1 directory, 
writable to its master and readable to its clients. 
.P
Note, when NFS is used to share the \f4/etc\f1 directory, 
the share command should be in the form 
\f4share -F nfs -r rw=p,root=p,ro=i:j:k /etc\f1, 
where \f4p\f1 is the slave's master and \f4i\f1,\f4j\f1, 
and \f4k\f1 are the slave's clients.  
.H 2 "OA&M - Remove System Name function"
Due to some data parsing problems, the OA&M menu 
item for removing a system name from a
basic networking database does not function.
This item was intended to be an interface to 
the \f4/etc/uucp/Systems\f1 file.
Administrators who want to remove a system from the 
list of systems that the machine communicates with 
must edit and delete the appropriate system name line in
the \f4/etc/uucp/Systems\f1 file.
.H 3 "Devconfig file"
.MR dm91-05809
STREAMS modules identified in the \f4/etc/uucp/Devconfig\f1 file
must be seven characters or less.  These modules are pushed onto
STREAMS devices to provide things like line disciplines and
read/write services for \f4cu\f1 and \f4uucp\f1 basic networking
services.
.H 2 "Cable Disconnections During I/O via tty ports"
.MR "bl90-12221.MR "bl90-12947
.MR "dm90-12497
If a cable is disconnected while reading from
or writing to an asynchronous communications port
(COM1 or COM2), the process will get a \f40\f1 in
the case of reading (for end of file) and an I/O
error in the case of writing.
.P
When the cable is reconnected to the port, the user
will continue to get the above return values from
read or write, rather than the input or output
starting back up again successfully. 
The only way around this is to close and then reopen the device.
.P
An explanation for this behavior is that upon detecting
"carrier loss" (disconnecting the cable), the driver
sends the message \f4M_HANGUP\f1 to the stream head.
When the stream head recognizes this, it sets a flag such
that from then on, any further reads or writes will
return an I/O error or \f40\f1, respectively, to the
user. 
When the carrier comes back (by connecting
the cable), the flag is not reset since the
streamhead does not know anything about it.
.H 2 "libnsl and the ABI"
.IX libnsl and ABI
In previous releases, three routines required for
\f4libnsl\f1 by the ABI were actually placed in a
different library. In this release,
\f4getpublickey\f1 and \f4getsecretkey\f1 have been
moved to match the ABI. 
Another routine, \f4svc_getargs\f1, will be dropped
from the \f4libnsl\f1 requirement in subsequent issues of
the ABI.
.H 2 "Dial Header File"
.LI dm91-00279
.IX dial.h header file
The dial header file (\f4/usr/include/dial.h\f1) is not delivered
with the UNIX System V Release 4/386 binary product.  It is only
available to source customers.
.IX iend UNIX System V/386 Release 4, networking notes

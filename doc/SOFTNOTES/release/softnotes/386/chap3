.BK  "Software Notes"
.CH "File Systems" "3"
.H 1 "File System Notes"
.IX istart UNIX System V/386 Release 4, file system notes
.H 2 "Virtual File System"
.H 3 "Source Compatibility"
.IX VFS, source compatibility
VFS constitutes an extensive rewrite of the
file system code. No substantial source compatibility 
should be expected for file system code written prior to SVR4.
.H 3 "Future Directions"
.IX VFS, future directions
Aspects of the VFS interface (particularly the interaction
between file system code and the Virtual Memory system)
are subject to change in future releases of the system.
Absolute compatibility is not guaranteed.
.H 3 "File System Files"
.IX VFS, \f4vfstab\fP files
.IX VFS, \f4mnttab\fP file format
.IX \f4mnttab\fP(4)
.IX \f4vfstab\fP(4)
The information that was contained in \f4/etc/checklist\f1 and
\f4/etc/fstab\f1 is now found in \f4/etc/vfstab\f1.
The commands \f4fsck\f1 and \f4ncheck\f1 now use 
\f4/etc/vfstab\f1 instead of \f4/etc/checklist\f1, and 
the \f4mount\f1 command now uses \f4/etc/vfstab\f1
instead of \f4/etc/fstab\f1.
(See the \f4mnttab\f1 manual page).
The file is now readable, and contains five fields.
.H 3 "Switchout"
.IX VFS, switchout
The following commands were coded to work on the VFS
switchout mechanism: \f4clri\f1, \f4dcopy\f1, \f4df\f1, 
\f4ff\f1, \f4ncheck\f1, \f4fsck\f1,
\f4fsdb\f1, \f4labelit\f1, \f4mkfs\f1, \f4mount\f1, \f4umount\f1, 
and \f4volcopy\f1. These commands have a generic module 
and file system specific modules which
the generic will call. Commands operating on unmounted file
systems shall either have the file system type supplied on
the command line with the \f4-F\f1 option, or an appropriate 
entry shall be provided by the administrator in \f4/etc/vfstab\f1.
.H 2 "File System Commands"
.IX istart file system commands
.IX \f4clri\fP command, function subsumed by \f4fsdb\fP
.H 3 "clri Command"
The \f4clri\f1 command is currently working
under the switchout mechanism but will be dropped in a future release.
\f4clri\f1's functionality is being replaced by \f4fsdb\f1 \f4-z\f1.
.IX \f4fsdb\fP
.H 3 "fsstat Command"
The function previously supplied by the \f4fsstat\f1 command
.IX \f4fsstat\fP command, function subsumed by \f4fsck\fP
.IX \f4fsck\fP
is now provided by \f4fsck -m\f1. \f4fsstat\f1 is provided in SVR4,
but its support will be dropped in a future release.
.H 3 "fsck Command"
.IX \f4fsck\f1 command
For the \f4fsck\f1 command, matching in 
\f4/etc/vfstab\f1 is performed
on the \f4fsckdev\f1 entry
in each line, \f4not\f1 the \f4special\f1 entry.
This implies that \f4mount /usr\f1 works, 
but \f4fsck /usr\f1 does not. 
In fact, \f4fsck <\f4fsckdev\f1 entry for \f4/usr\f1>, works.
.P
.IX \f4mountall\f1 code
The \f4mountall\f1 code has been changed to use 
\f4fsck -m\f1 to determine if a file system is suitable for mounting.
.H 3 "Future Directions"
.IX file system commands, future directions, \f4mount\f1 command
The format of the \f4mount\f1 command will be replaced 
in a future release by a new format currently provided under 
the \f4-v\f1 option.
.P
.IX \f4ff\f1 command
Since the \f4ff\f1 command is more flexible, it will eventually
supersede \f4ncheck\f1.
In a future release,
\f4ff\f1 will subsume all functionality of 
\f4ncheck\f1 and \f4ncheck\f1 will be removed from the system.
.H 3 "compress command"
.MR ul91-04418
The \f4compress\f1(1) command cannot be used on file names that
consist of more than 14 characters.  Rename the file and try
\f4compress\f1 again.
.IX iend file system commands
.H 2 "File System Types"
.H 3 s5
.IX s5-FSTypes, size checking changes
The s5 specific \f4fsck\f1 command code has changed for 
size checking. The "possible file size error" that was suppressed
with the \f4-q\f1 option no longer exists. If the number of blocks
in an inode exceeds the file size, the user is asked if the
excess blocks should be recovered or deleted. If a directory size
is not a multiple of the directory structure size, the user is
asked if the size should be set to the address of the
last byte of the file or left unchanged.
.P
.IX \f4mount\f1 command, \f4-r\f1 option
The option \f4-r\f1 of the s5 specific \f4mount\f1 command is
provided in SVR4 for compatibility, but the function 
of this option is executed by the \f4-o ro\f1 option.
The \f4-r\f1 option will be removed in a future release. 
.H 3 RFS
See Chapter 4, \f2Networking Notes\f1, for information on
Remote File Sharing(RFS) implementation issues.
.H 3 "proc File System"
.BL
.LI
Utilities that use \f4/proc\f1 may fail if they try to read
.IX /proc file system, locking utilities
information about an existing hung process.
They may sleep waiting to lock a process' information.
If a particular process is hung, the utility may sleep
forever.
This problem is apparent if a user
executes a utility that does locking in 
\f4/proc\f1 (such as \f4ps\f1 or
\f4priocntl\f1), and the system currently has a live process that
is hung after locking its process information.
.LI
.MR dm90-25677
A full backup of the system (from \f4/\f1) using \f4cpio\f1(1) will
fail if \f4/proc\f1 is mounted.
However, use of the \f4backup\f1(1M) command for a complete
system backup will work.
Unmount the \f4/proc\f1 file system
before doing a full system backup with \f4cpio\f1.
.LE
.H 3 "UFS"
.IX \f4ufs\fP-FSType, new \f4ff\fP and \f4fsdb\fP commands
.IX \f4ufs\fP-FSType, unsupported BSD commands
.IX \f4ufs\fP-FSType, istart source compatibility
The UFS file system is compatible with the BSD file system.
.H 4 "New Commands and Source Compatibility"
.IX istart new commands, SVR4 BDS, and SunOS
.IX \f4ff\f1 command 
A new command, \f4ff\f1, similar to its counterparts
for the \f4s5\f1 file system, is supported for UFS.
This command is not contained in SunOS or BSD.
.P
Commands should be built from \f4:mkcmd\f1 so that 
loader options are set to not use dynamic libraries where appropriate.
.H 4 "mount Command"
.IX \f4mount\f1 command 
The BSD "\f4mount\f1 \f4-a\f1" option is 
not supported in UFS.
\f4mountall\f1 should be used to mount all file 
systems (including UFS file systems) specified in 
\f4/etc/vfstab\f1.
.IX \f4mount\f1 command, \f4grpid\f1 option
.IX \f4mount\f1 command, \f4quota\f1 option
.IX \f4mount\f1 command, \f4noquota\f1 option
.IX \f4mount\f1 command, \f4noauto\f1 option
The following options to \f4mount\f1, which 
are supported in SunOS, are not
supported for UFS in SVR4: \f4grpid\f1, \f4quota\f1, 
\f4noquota\f1, \f4noauto\f1.
.IX \f4mount\f1 command, \f4suid\f1 option
The "\f4suid\f1" option is not supported; UFS file systems
are mounted with \f4setuid\f1 execution allowed by default. The
"\f4nosuid\f1" option is available to mount UFS file systems
with \f4setuid\f1 execution disallowed.
.H 4 "df Command"
.MR ul91-08506
Disk space reporting on ufs file systems is inaccurate when the file
system is unmounted.  For example, when you run
.br

\f4df -t /dev/dsk/\f2???\f1

.fi
on an unmounted file system, the values of blocks
used and free reported is only half that reported when the file
system is mounted.
.H 4 "fsck Command"
.IX \f4fsck\f1 command, \f4-p\f1 option
.BL
.LI
The \f4-p\f1 option to \f4fsck\f1 (supported as suboption \f4p\f1 
under \f4-o\f1) does not work in parallel, as it does in BSD/SunOS.
.P
.IX \f4errno\f1 messages, SunOS/BDS
Unlike SunOS/BSD which uses the errno message \f4EDQUOTA\f1, no 
special \f4errno\f1 is returned when a user tries
to exceed quota limits.
Instead, an \f4errno\f1 is returned that indicates failure 
due to the lack of space.
The \f4errno\f1 message \f4ENOSPC\f1 is the most common.
.LI
.MR dm91-01776
Don't use the \f4fsck\f1(1M) command on mounted file systems.
.LE
.H 4 "ufsdump/ufsrestore"
.IX \f4ufsdump\fP, problem
\f4ufsdump\f1 sometimes reports more blocks written than it 
actually writes.
Therefore, the blocks reported by \f4ufsrestore\f1 
and \f4ufsdump\f1 may be slightly different.
The dump is executed correctly and should be usable.
If there is a discrepancy between the two commands on the
number of blocks in the dump, the number reported 
by \f4ufsrestore\f1, which should be slightly less than that 
reported by \f4ufsdump\f1, is correct.
.H 4 "mkfs and UFS"
.MR "From awn 6/21/90"
.IX \f4mkfs\f1 and UFS
.BL
.LI
\f4mkfs\f1 on a UFS file system has a compatibility
mode that lets you limit the number of inodes
to 64k.
This provides compatibility with System V
Release 3.2 applications that require access to 
inode numbers.
This compatibility mode is used by default in \f4disksetup\f1
or by invoking \f4mkfs\f1 with the \f4-C\f1 option.
.LI
.MR ul91-12322
When you make a ufs file system, the \f4mkfs -F ufs\f1 command
ignores the \f4:inodes\f1 addendum and calculates the number of
inodes available to the file system itself.  The result is that the
file system may have substantially fewer inodes available than it
requires, with no way to change the number.
.LE
.H 4 "MAXFRAG"
This release of System V/386 Release 4 redefines
\f4MAXFRAG\f1 to 8.
Any file systems created on a previous version using
a different \f4MAXFRAG\f1 should be mounted read-only.
.H 4 "proto file"
.IX \f4proto\f1 file
Neither the BSD \f4mkproto\f1 command nor the 
s5 \f4mkfs -p\f1 option is supported in UFS.
.H 4 "ncheck Command"
.IX \f4ncheck\f1 command, \f4-m\f1 option
The \f4-m\f1 option works only for inodes specified under the
\f4-i\f1 option.
.H 4 "quota Command"
.IX \f4quota\f1 command
The \f4quota\f1 command only works correctly when
all UFS file systems that are currently mounted have a quota file.
An empty file named quota should be placed at the 
root of each UFS file system.
.IX iend new commands, SVR4 BDS, and SunOS
.H 2 "Symbolic Links-Compatibility SVR4/SunOS"
.IX symbolic links, SVR4 and SunOS
The following list references a few of the 
incompatibilities between SVR4 and SunOS features.
.H 4 "link System Call"
.IX SVR4, SunOS, \f4link\f1 system call
SVR4 allows hard links to symbolic links; SunOS does not.
.H 4 "chown System Call"
.IX SVR4, SunOS, \f4chown\f1 system call
SVR4 \f4chown\f1 follows symbolic links and changes the 
owner and group of the referenced file; SunOS \f4chown\f1 
does not follow, but changes the owner and 
group of the symbolic link.
.H 4 "lchown Command"
.IX SVR4, SunOS, \f4lchown\f1 command
This command is new in SVR4. It is the same as 
\f4chown\f1 except \f4lchown\f1 
does not follow a symbolic link. Rather, it 
changes the owner and group of the symbolic link.
.H 4 "file Command"
.IX SVR4, SunOS, \f4file\f1 command
SVR4 default is to follow and use \f4-h\f1 option 
to not follow; SunOS default is not follow 
and use \f4-L\f1 option to follow.
.H 4 "find Command"
.IX SVR4, SunOS, \f4find\f1 command
SVR4 has \f4-follow\f1 option to follow; SunOS does not.

.H 1 "Line Printer Spooling Utilities Notes"
.IX istart UNIX System V/386 Release 4, line printer notes
The UNIX System V/386 Release 4 Line Printer (LP) Spooling Utilities package has been enhanced to include the following new features:
.BL
.LI
Inclusion of new networking feature.
.LI
Addition of new \f4lpsystem\f1 command to define remote systems.
.LI

format plus inclusion of the following new functionality:
.DL
.LI
Addition of class administration feature
.LI
Addition of request administration feature
.LI
Addition of priority administration feature
.LE
.LI

.LI
Ability to define a printer with multiple printer-types or content-types using
the \f4lpadmin\f1 command.
.LI
Inclusion of PostScript filters.
.LE
.P
Please refer to the manual pages and the \f2System Administrator's Guide\fR
for detailed information regarding the new features listed above.
.H 2 "Compatibility"
.IX LP print service, source compatibility
The SVR4 Line Printer Spooling Utilities is not source compatible
with SVR3.
Specifically, the new networking capability is based
on new functionality provided in SVR4.
.H 2 "Known Problems"
.H 3 "Networking"
.IX LP print service, networking cautions
.P
Although the new Line Printer Spooling Utilities networking 
feature works, it has not been thoroughly stress tested.
It is possible that stressing the network capability 
may result in suspending LP network activity
requiring the administrator to restart \f4lpsched\f1.
.P
It is also possible that the networking feature may
fault when attempting to network with a BSD system.
.P 
SVR4 does not support the \f4-R\f1 option to 
the \f4lpstat\f1 command, as documented on the 
\f4lpstat\f1(1) manual page. 
This option should not be used.
.P
If a user's remote print request is cancelled by the
administrator on the remote machine, the user is not
notified by mail. Cancelling the request from the local
machine generates the correct mail notification. In both
cases the request is successfully cancelled. 
.H 3 "BSD Compatibility Commands"
.IX LP print service, BSD compatibility
.P
The BSD compatibility commands \f4lpc, lpq, lpr,\f1 and
\f4lprm\f1 are operational, but may not be fully functional.
\f4lprm\f1 has only partial functionality.
Please use the Line Printer Spooling
commands instead.
.H 3 "Line Printer Spooling Utilities Directory Structure"
.IX LP print service, directory structure
.P
In this release the LP spooling directory structure has been changed to
follow the new standard directory conventions; many
files have been moved but the formats have not been changed.
Please refer to the \f2System Administrator's Guide\f1 for details on
the new structure.
.H 3 "Line Printer Spooling Utilities over RFS"
.IX LP print service, RFS compatibility
Due to directory structure changes, SVR4 LP is not
compatible with SVR3 LP across RFS.
Note that when you run the Line Printer Spooling
Utilities over an RFS network, all machines in the network must be running 
the same version of LP.
.H 2 "Line Printer Spooling Utilities over NFS"
.MR dm91-10901
Always use \f4lp -c\f1 to print a file that is located on an nfs
remote resource.  The \f4lp\f1 command, without \f4-c\f1, will hang
if you try to print an inaccessible file from a remotely mounted nfs
resource to a remote printer.  For example, mount an nfs resource on
\f4/mnt/d1\f1 and print a file that has permissions closed to other
(e.g. \f4lp -dprinter1 /mnt/d1/testfile\f1).  If \f4printer1\f1 is a
remote printer, \f4lp\f1 will hang and loop indeterminately.  
.H 2 "lpstat Command"
.MR "bl90-04713
If the output of 
\f4lpstat -o -l\f1 always shows that a
particular \f4lp\f1 request is cancelled, then 
the following script should be
run as root:
.DS I UI
lpshut
cd /var/spool/lp
find requests tmp ! -type d ! -name .SEQF -exec rm {} \\;
/usr/lib/lp/lpsched
.DE
.H 2 "Printer Interface Concerns"
.MR "bl90-11414
.MR "bl90-07209
Since an Apple laser printer interface is not standard, the
user cannot just use a standard RS232 printer cable.
The cable used must tie \f4DTR\f1 to \f4DCD\f1 to configure printer 
with \f4O_NDELAY\f1 flag on.
.H 2 "Batch Postscript"
.MR "dm90-28476
Many postscript printers support the option to
run the printer in batch postscript mode over a
parallel port.
This is not supported by the line printer system.
You must use interactive postscript mode over a
serial line.
.IX iend UNIX System V/386 Release 4, line printer notes
.H 2 "lp Device"
.MR dm91-07101
The device: \f4/dev/lp\f1 should not be used directly.  The hardware
is unable to signal the driver that no cable is attached.  Should
the cable be disconnected during a print job it should be
reattached.  The driver should eventually time out and resume
printing.

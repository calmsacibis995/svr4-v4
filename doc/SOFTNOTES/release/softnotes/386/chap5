.H 1 "System Administration and Maintenance Notes"
.IX istart UNIX System V/386 Release 4, system administration notes
.H 2 "Improved Backup and Restore Operations"
.H 3 "Extended Backup and Restore"
.MR "bl90-13814
If the user would like to use the extended \f4backup\f1 and
\f4restore\f1 capabilities provided by OA&M, the following changes
must be made,
.P
For the \f4backup\f1 section, edit \f4/usr/sadm/sysadm/menu/backup_service/ext.menu\f1 and add the line:
.DS I UI
extended^Extended Backup Services^backup.menu
.DE
For the \f4restore\f1 section, edit \f4/usr/sadm/sysadm/menu/restores/ext.menu\f1 and add the line:
.DS I UI
extended^Extended Restore Services^restore.menu
.DE
.AB N
Use of the extended \f4backup\fP and \f4restore\fP capabilities requires
an advanced level of familiarity with SVR4's \f4backup\fP and 
\f4restore\fP commands.
(For more information, see the \f2System Administrator's Guide\fP).
.AC
.H 3 "Source Compatibility"
System administrators must recreate the online backup 
schedule using the \f4bkreg\f1 command.  
.H 3 "Future Directions"
.IX \f4ckbupscd\fP
The \f4ckbupscd\f1 command will not be supported 
in future releases.
.H 2 "Specific Backup/Restore Notes and Workarounds"
.H 3 "backup and cpio"
.MR "ul90-24714 
Do not use \f4cpio\f1, \f4volcopy\f1, or \f4tar\f1 to backup \f4/usr\f1. 
Only use the \f4backup\f1 command to backup \f3/usr\f1.
\f4cpio\f1, \f4volcopy\f1 and \f4tar\f1 are resident in \f3/usr/sbin\f1.
.IX backup jobs, label checking override
.H 3 "-o Method Option"
.IX backup jobs, \f4-o\f1 method
The \f4-o\f1 \f4method\f1 option overrides label checking on 
\f4backup\f1.
The override allows a backup to a tape or disk that
has a label different from that specified for the operation.
Because \f4restore\f1, and \f4rsoper\f1 always check
labels, non-NULL labelled media should always be supplied in
any backup operation, even with label checking override.
.H 3 "Backup and Device Names"
.IX \f4backup\f1 and \f4restore\f1
When using the \f4backup/restore\f1 commands, 
a specific device name must be specified
not just the device group.
If for some reason, the device group must also
be specified, the ``spool'' entry in 
\f4/etc/device.tab\f1 must be moved to the
end of the file.
.AB N
Save a copy of the \f4/etc/device.tab\fP file as it 
is recreated each time the system boots.
.AC
.H 3 "Fimage Archives"
.IX backup methods, full image
.IX backup methods, full file
The \f4fimage\f1 method restores an entire file system.
If such an archive is online, and the file system is 
unmounted, the restore will occur automatically.  
A slice may be unintentionally overwritten if the
administrator requests a \f4restore\f1 and such an archive is
available.
.H 3 "Backup Strategy"
.IX backup strategy, \f4fimage\f1 and \f4ffile\f1
Both \f4fimage\f1 and \f4ffile\f1 methods are 
complete file system backup strategies and 
are mutually exclusive.
Correct strategy is to use either \f4fimage\f1 or 
\f4ffile\f1 in conjunction with \f4incfile\f1.
.H 3 "Viewing Archive Labels"
.IX backup jobs, archive label viewing
The \f4rsoper\f1 \f4-n\f1 \f4-d\f1 command allows an 
administrator to view the label of the archive 
on the device specified.
This is useful if external labels are damaged or a 
backup history is lost.
.H 3 "sysadm Backup Service"
.MR ul90-26926
.MR ul91-11932
The option to backup all user files (\f4All\f1) using \f4sysadm\f1
fails.  (The means of selection within \f4sysadm\f1 is \f4backup_
service\f1, \f4basic\f1, \f4System Backup\f1, \f4Backup Users\f1,
\f2media\f1, \f4All\f1.) You can get the desired results by marking
the users individually from the menu before trying the backup.
.H 3 "backup and Relative Paths"
.MR ul91-04220
The \f4sysadm\f1 backup and restore facility creates backups using
relative pathnames.
However, the restore utility does not have the
current directory set to root (\f4/\f1) when it is executed.  The
workaround is to log in as \f4root\f1, instead of \f4sysadm\f1, and
execute the utility from the root directory.
.H 3 "/etc/bkup/rsstatus.tab: Not Created During Installation"
.IX \f4etc/bkup/rsstatus.tab\f1 
The file \f4etc/bkup/rsstatus.tab\f1 is not created when the
system is installed.
If you attempt to query this file using the Extended 
Restore function under OA&M, you will get a message to
this effect.
This is not serious as the file will be created
when the first Extended Restore is executed under OA&M.
.H 2 "Console Logging"
.H 3 "Future Directions"
.IX consol logging, future directions, \f4/dev/console\f1 and \f4/dev/syscon\f1
The \f4/dev/console\f1 and \f4/dev/syscon\f1 
special files are still available for use
in this release.
Access to a console by \f4/dev/console\f1 may be
unavailable in future releases.
.H 2 "System Administration Menus sysadm"
.IX menus (\f4sysadm\fP), dependencies and compatibilities
.IX \f4sysadm\fP, dependencies and compatibilities
A new screen-based administrative interface, \f4sysadm\f1, is 
introduced in SVR4.
This interface uses FMLI utilities and can be 
operated with the function keys on most terminals.
.H 4 "Function Key Resets"
.IX function key resets
In a limited number of cases, users may find that keyboard
function keys may need to be reset after the termination of
a \f4sysadm\f1 session.
.H 3 "Future Directions"
.IX unsupported administrative logins
.IX \f4sysadmn\f1
.IX \f4setup\f1
.IX \f4powerdown\f1 
.IX \f4makefys\f1
.IX \f4mountfsys\f1
The administrative logins (i.e. \f4setup\f1, 
\f4powerdown\f1, \f4makefsys\f1, \f4mountfsys\f1, 
\f4umountfsys\f1, and \f4checkfsys\f1) no longer have
entries in \f4/etc/passwd\f1 and may not be 
supported in the next release.
.H 2 "Device Management"
.IX table driven device mangement facility
A table driven device management facility is provided in this
release.
The administration feature set depends upon the information
in a device table to access tape drives, floppy disks, and
hard disks for software installation, backup/restore operations, and
device access throughout the \f4sysadm\f1 interface.
The table may be populated using the 
\f4storage_devices/descriptions/add\f1
task on the \f4sysadm\f1 interface.  
.H 3 "Source Compatibility"
.IX source compatibility, installation commands
The SVR4 software installation feature recognizes
packages in the pre-SVR4 format and cannot be used to install and
remove such packages.
.IX \f4installpkg\f1
.IX \f4removepkg\f1
.IX \f4displaypkg\f1
The SVR3.2 commands \f4installpkg\f1, \f4removepkg\f1, 
and \f4displaypkg\f1 are provided for compatibility.
It is recommended, that new software packages be created
and existing packages be converted, where feasible,
using the new format in order to take advantage of 
package auditing capabilities, and future enhancements.
Add-on packages that supply \f4FACE\f1 interface tasks
should use the new \f4sysadm\f1 hierarchy.
.SK
.H 2 "User and Password Administration"
.H 3 "useradd Command"
.IX useradd
.MR us90-27801
When you add a user (using \f4useradd\f1(1M)), be careful if the
home directory you assign to it already exists.  If the directory is
already owned by another user and permissions are not open, the new
user will not have access to its own home directory.  The
\f4useradd\f1 command does not warn you of this fact when you add
the user.
.H 3 "passwd Command"
.IX passwd(1)
.MR dm91-12701
.MR ul91-16110
The \f4passwd\f1 command behaves inconsistently in regards to the
option that turns off password aging.  If \f4passwd -x 0 \f2user\f1
is run, sometimes \f2user\f1 will be requested to change the
password at the next login session and sometimes the user will not.
.H 3 "Future Directions"
.IX \f4pwconv\fP
The \f4pwconv\f1 command will not be updated in future 
releases to work with new identification and 
authorization database files.
.IX \f4passmgmt\fP
.P
The \f4passmgmt\f1 command will be removed from distribution in
the next release.
The functionality has been replaced by the SVR4 
\f4useradd\f1, \f4usermod\f1, and \f4userdel\f1 commands.
.H 2 "EVGA Mode Changes"
.\Mark Gitner
.IX EVGA mode changes
For the video cards that are described 
on the \f4evgainit\f1 manual page,
there are new mode switching constants in \f4kd.h\f1.
They are all prefixed with \f4SW_GEN_ \f1 followed by the resolution.
These should be used to set any of these video cards to graphics 
modes with resolutions higher than 640x480.
For example, to set the video card to 800x600, the 
\f4SW_GEN_800x600\f1 constant would be used.
The ioctl to set the mode will succeed if the video card 
in question supports the specified resolution, otherwise 
it will fail and set errno to \f4ENXIO\f1.
In order to set the video card mode, first open \f4/dev/video\f1 
and then do an \f4ioctl\f1 on the file descriptor with the 
appropriate mode switching constant.
For example:
.DS I UI
fd = open("/dev/video", O_RDWR);

ioctl(fd, SW_GEN_800x600, 0);

.H 2 "Commands"
.H 3 "pkgadd"
.MR "dm90-27584
.IX \f4pkgadd\f1
There is a problem with the OA&M \f4pkgadd\f1 if the
files contained in the OA&M package have group
ownership values not contained in the system's
\f4/etc/group\f1 file.
Enter the group owner ID values in the \f4/etc/group\f1 file.
.P
Labels must be specified for all backups and 
there must be enough for the number of volumes to be created.
The option to overwrite the label \f4-o\f1, should not be used.
.H 3 "pkgmk"
.IX \f4pkgmk\f1
When using \f4pkgmk\f1 to create a file, the 
capacity specified should be slightly
less than the true capacity of the device.
The simpliest way to do this is to 
add \f4-l <sm. size>\f1 to the \f4pkgmk\f1 command line.
Where <sm. size> is roughly equal 
to the size of the \f4pkginfo\f1 file (in 512 byte blocks) 
plus 1.
If the new value is still too large, a 
warning about no space being left on the device will
be sent to the console.
.H 3 "pkgrm"
If a package removal fails, attempts to remove the package again.
If the removal still fails the second time, then try to remove
the lock file as outlined here. 
To remove the lock file do the following:
.DS 1i
1. \f4cd /var/sadm/pkg\f1

2. \f4cd\f1 <pkgname> 
	where <pkgname> is the directory 
	corresponding to the package you are trying to install.
	Check the "NAME" field in the \f4pkginfo\f1 file to
	assure the correct directory has been selected

3. Remove the file called \f4!R-Lock!\f1.
.DE
.H 3 "pwck"
.IX \f4pwck\fP
System Administrators should be aware that the
command \f4pwck\f1 only lists information about \f4/etc/passwd\f1,
and not \f4/etc/shadow\f1.
.H 2 "OA&M Screens and Help"
.MR "bl90-04505
.IX OA&M screens and Help
The following menus have no Help text:
.BL
.LI
restore_services/extended/status/full
.LI
backup_services/extended/status/full
.LI

.LE
.P
Consult Networking documentation for help.
.H 2 "Setting up RFS through sysadm"
.MR "bl90-12232
.IX RFS via \f4sysadm\f1 menus 
Setting up RFS via \f4sysadm\f1 menus is not currently
possible. 
The menu function for RFS is unpredictable and problematic.

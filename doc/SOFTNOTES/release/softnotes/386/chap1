.IX istart UNIX System V/386 Release 4, installation notes
The following section contains information needed before
installing UNIX System V/386 Release 4
on your system.
.H 3 "ESDI Disk Controllers"
.MR "mgg 6-15-90"
.IX ESDI controllers
On ESDI disk controllers, System V/386 Release 4 
is unable to recognize cylinders above
1024, thus making the large disks appear smaller than they
are.
The support cylinders greater than 1024 on ESDI drive
enable logical translation on the disk controller.
If the correct system setup value does not
recognize the entire disk, replacing the BIOS will 
remove this problem.
.H 2 "Cartridge Tape Controllers"

.IX Wangtek, Everex and Archive hardware
In order to install the reference binary from
tape, the controller hardware must have the
following settings:
.IX base address settings
.DS I
Base address for I/O port 0x300
Interrupt vector             5 
DMA channel                  1
.DE
.AB N
See your hardware cartridge tape reference manual 
for instructions on how to set the base address, 
interrupt and DMA to those listed above.
.AC
.P
.IX controller error message
If you do not have a tape controller or your controller is 
not configured correctly, the following message is 
displayed at boot time:
.SS
Cartridge Controller was not found at address 00000300H
		  Tape driver disabled

	The cartridge tape will be inoperative.
.SE
.H 2 "Boot Diskettes"
.IX write-protected boot disks
Boot disks are now write-protected.
This is normal and the write-protect tabs must not be
removed.
.H 2 "Size of Swap"
.IX the size of \f4/dev/swap\f1
When running networking applications, the size of 
\f4/dev/swap\f1 should be
at least 11MB, or equal to 2 times the size of installed
memory, or whichever is larger.
You can allocate this space at installation time or
use the \f4swap -a\f1 command to add additional space if 
your system is already installed.
.H 2 "Mixing Packages"
.MR "bl90-14531"
.IX mixing packages in file system and datastream format 
Packages in file system format should not
be mixed with packages in datastream format during 
installation.
Install all of one type of package, then
quit out of the installation script and install the other
type.
All the System V/386 Release 4 software
packages are in datastream format.
.H 2 "Disk Partitioning with DOS/UNIX"
.MR "bl90-13043"
.IX disk partitioning, DOS/UNIX
The DOS 4.01 \f4fdisk\f1 program assumes it can store diagnostic
information in the last cylinder available on the 
hard disk, so if a UNIX partition is
created that uses the last cylinder, MS-DOS 4.01 
\f4fdisk\f1 will be unable to create a DOS partition.
The user workaround is to either create the UNIX partition at 
the front of the disk so the last cylinder isn't used, or 
create the DOS partition using the UNIX 
\f4fdisk\f1 (not DOS \f4fdisk\f1) and never delete the
DOS partition. 
.P
.IX boot from DOS floppy
If you boot from a DOS floppy, you will not be able
to access a physical DOS partition on the hard disk,
drive C, unless it is the first partition created by
\f4fdisk\f1.
.H 2 "tar Compatibility"
.IX tar incompatibility
There is one instance of incompatibility
between the SVR4 and pre-SVR4 versions of the \f4tar\f1 command.
The SVR4 \f4tar\f1 command will not restore
files properly if both of the following
conditions are true:
.AL
.LI
The archive being read was created with a
pre-SVR4 version of the \f4tar\f1 command
.LI
a file within the archive spans a volume
boundary.
.LE
.IX tar incompatibility conditions
When both of these conditions are true, the
pre-SVR4 version of the \f4tar\f1 command can be used to restore the
archive.
The suggested workaround is to save and rename your pre-SVR4 version of \f4tar\f1.
.H 3 "tar and Subdirectories"
.MR ul91-16907
.P
There are also compatibility problems with
archives containing subdirectories.
If an archive containing subdirectories of files is created on a
UNIX System V, Release 4
\f4tar\f1 command, it can not be read into a Release 3.2 system.
.IX iend UNIX System V/386 Release 4, installation notes
.H 3 "tar and Symbolic Links"
.IX SVR4, SunOS, \f4file\f1 command
SVR4 has \f4-L\f1 option to follow symbolic links; 
SunOS has \f4-h\f1 option to follow.
.H 2 "cpio Command"
.IX SVR4, SunOS, \f4cpio\f1 command
SVR4 has \f4-L\f1 option to follow; SunOS does not.
.H 2 "/etc/vfstab Entries Created by diskadd"
.MR "bl90-05424"
.MR "bl90-13507"
.IX \f4diskadd\f1 command, \f4/etc/vfstab\f1
If the \f4diskadd\f1 command is run more than once the 
entries in \f4/etc/vfstab\f1 for that drive may not be deleted.
If you intend to run the \f4diskadd\f1 
command more than once for a given drive, 
delete the entries for it in \f4/etc/vfstab\f1 prior
to running \f4diskadd\f1.
.P
This problem also occurs any time
disk partitions are changed or disks are removed from the system.
The \f4/etc/vfstab\f1 file is appended to and never
cleared and regenerated.  Therefore, the file will contain some
outdated information.
.H 3 "diskadd and mount points"
.MR "bl90-08708
The \f4diskadd\f1 operation allows the user to re-use
mount points that already exist in the \f4/etc/vfstab\f1
file.
When re-used mount points are mounted the \f4diskadd\f1 
operation fails when attempting to re-mount the selected mount point.
When re-used mount points are not mounted the \f4diskadd\f1 
operation succeeds.
.H 3 "diskadd and two-disk systems"
.MR dm91-03917
If you are installing UNIX System V Release V/386 on a two-disk
system, you must do a low-level format on the second disk before
installing the system.
If the second disk already contains
information you want to keep, such as a DOS partition, you must back
that partition, do a low level format, install the UNIX System, then
restore the partition.

.H 2 "High-Resolution Timers"
.H 3 "Source Compatibility"
In UNIX System V/386 Release 4, \f4gettimeofday\f1 and \f4settimeofday\f1 
take one argument.  The second argument used with the
respective BSD calls (and in the BSD compatibility library)
has long been obsolete and is ignored.
.P
In \f4libucb.a\f1, the \f4alarm\f1 and \f4sleep\f1 functions
are written using \f4setitimer\f1 [see \f4getitimer\fP(3C)].
.IX \f4getitimer\fP(3C)
In \f4libc.a\f1, \f4alarm\f1 is independent of \f4setitimer\f1.
In SVR4, a \f4sleep\fP following a \f4setitimer\fP wipes out
knowledge of the user signal handler. Therefore do not use \f4setitimer\fP with \f4sleep\fP.
.H 3 "Future Directions"
These routines will be included in SVR4 until the POSIX P1003.4
standard on Real Time System Interfaces is completed.

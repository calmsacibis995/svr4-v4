Software Development Library routines provide for program diagnostics as well as for monitoring and profiling the execution of C language programs.
The Software Development Library also has routines to access user-accounting and other system data-files with information about users and groups of users.

.H 1 "C Programming Language Utilities (CPLU)"
C is a general-purpose programming language used for system-level code and
commercial and scientific applications.
The C language bridges the realm of assembly-language programming and block-structured procedure-oriented languages by combining the advantages of low-level languages with the benefits and features of high-level languages.
Programmers using C can deal easily with machine-level facilities at a low-level, while having the high-control and data structures found in other modern, structured programming languages.
Using C as a low-level language, programmers can achieve maximum efficiency by exploiting specific machine characteristics; using C as a high-level language, programmers can hide the details of the underlying computer to promote software portability.
.P
C Compilation System software offers a complete software development environment composed of C Programming Language Utilities (CPLU), Advanced Programming Utilities (APU), and C Programmer's Productivity Tools (CPPT).
CPLU contains the C Compiler and compiler-related tools; APU contains popular programming and debugging tools; and CPPT consists of two complementary tools:  a source code browser and an execution profiler.
.P
Issue 3.1 of C compilation System software added support for shared
libraries (files containing object-code that several users on a system can share).
The currently available C Issue 5 extends shared libraries to dynamic linking and introduces the Extensible Linking Format (ELF).  ELF
is a more advanced object file format that replaces the older Common Object File format (COFF), although it continues to support the use of COFF files.
.H 2 "Software Generation System (SGS)"
The Software Generation System (SGS) provides the tools necessary to compile and link applications for the UNIX system.
Also included is the C Language Compilation System.

.H 2 "C++ Translator"
The C++ programming language, invented at AT&T Bell Laboratories, incorporates the latest advancements in object-oriented programming technology.
As an upwardly compatible enchancement to the standard C programming language, C++ brings the advantages of object-oriented programming to UNIX System V while maintaining the flexibility and efficiency of C.
The most recent release of the C++ Translator, C++ Release 2.0, completes implementation of all features planned for what is quickly becoming a standard programming language for the UNIX operating system.

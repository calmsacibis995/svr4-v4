.SH NAME
\f4mkstemp\f1 \- make a unique file name
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\f4cc \f1[ \f2flag\f1\. \. \. ] \f2file\f1 \. \. \. \f4\-lucb\f1
.P
\f4mkstemp(template)\f1
\f4char *template;\f1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4mkstemp\f1
creates a unique file name, typically in a
temporary filesystem, by replacing
.I template
with a unique file name, and returns a file descriptor
for the template file open for reading and writing.
The string in
.I template
should contain a file name with six trailing \f4X\f1s;
\f4mkstemp\f1 replaces the \f4X\f1s
with a letter and the current process
.SM ID\s0.
The letter will be chosen so that the resulting
name does not duplicate an existing file.
\f4mkstemp\f1 avoids the race between testing whether the
file exists and opening it for use.

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
\f4mkstemp\f1 returns \-1 if no suitable file could be created.
.SH NOTES
It is possible to run out of letters.
.PP
\f4mkstemp\f1
actually changes the template string which you pass;
this means that you cannot use the same template
string more than once \(em you need a fresh
template for every unique file you want to open.
.PP
When \f4mkstemp\f1 is creating a new unique filename it checks
for the prior existence of a file with that name.
This means that if you are creating more than one
unique filename, it is bad practice to use the
same root template for multiple invocations of
\f4mkstemp\f1.

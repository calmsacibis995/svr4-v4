.SH NAME
\f4index\f1, \f4rindex\f1 \- string operations
.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
.nf
\f4#include <string.h>\f1
.P
\f4char \(**index(s, c)\f1
\f4char \(**s, c;\f1
.P
\f4char \(**rindex(s, c)\f1
\f4char \(**s, c;\f1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
These functions operate on
\f4NULL\fP-terminated
strings.  They do not check for overflow of
any receiving string.
.P
\f4index\f1
and
\f4rindex\f1
returns a pointer to the first (last) occurrence of character
.I c
in string
.IR s ,
or a
\f4NULL\fP
pointer if
.I c
does not occur in the string.
The
\f4NULL\fP
character terminating a string is considered to
be part of the string.
.SH SEE ALSO
\f4bstring\fP(3),
\f4strings\fP(3)\f1
.P
\f4malloc\fP(3C)
in the \f2Programmer's Reference Manual\f1
.SH NOTES
For user convenience, these functions
are declared in the optional
\f4<strings.h>\f1
header file. 
.P
On the Sun processor, as well as on many other machines, you can
.I not
use a
\f4NULL\fP
pointer to indicate a
\f4NULL\fP
string.  A
\f4NULL\fP
pointer is an error and results in an abort
of the program.  If you wish to indicate a
\f4NULL\fP
string, you must have a pointer that
points to an explicit
\f4NULL\fP
string.  On some implementations of the C
language on some machines, a
\f4NULL\fP
pointer, if dereferenced, would yield a
\f4NULL\fP
string; this highly
non-portable trick was used in some programs.
Programmers using a
\f4NULL\fP
pointer to represent an empty string should be
aware of this portability issue; even on
machines where dereferencing a
\f4NULL\fP
pointer does not cause an abort of the
program, it does not necessarily yield a
\f4NULL\fP
string.
.P
Character movement is performed differently
in different implementations.
Thus overlapping moves may yield surprises.

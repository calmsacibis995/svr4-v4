.SH NAME
\f4utimes\f1 \- set file times
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4cc \f1[ \f2flag\f1\. \. \. ] \f2file\f1 \. \. \. \f4\-lucb\f1
.P
.nf
\f4#include <sys/types.h>\f1
.P
\f4int utimes(file, tvp)\f1
\f4char *file;\f1
\f4struct timeval \(**tvp;\f1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\f4utimes\f1
sets the access and modification times of the file named by
.IR file .
.P
If
.I tvp
is
\f4NULL\fP,
the access and modification times are set to the current time.
A process must be the owner of the file or have write permission for
the file to use
\f4utimes\f1
in this manner.
.P
If
.I tvp
is not
\f4NULL\fP,
it is assumed to point to an array of two
\f4timeval\f1
structures.
The access time is set to the value of the first member,
and the modification time is set to the value of the second member.
Only the owner of the file or the privileged user may use
\f4utimes\f1
in this manner.
.P
In either case, the
.I inode-changed
time of the file is set to the current time.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.
Otherwise, a value of \-1 is returned and
\f4errno\f1
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
\f4utimes\f1
will fail if one or more of the following are true:
.TP 20
\f4ENOTDIR\fP
A component of the path prefix of
.I file
is not a directory.
.TP
\f4ENAMETOOLONG\fP
The length of a component of
.I file
exceeds 255 characters, or the length of
.I file
exceeds 1023 characters.
.TP
\f4ENOENT\fP
The file referred to by
.I file
does not exist.
.TP
\f4EACCES\fP
Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix of
.IR file .
.TP
\f4ELOOP\fP
Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating
.IR file .
.TP
\f4EPERM\fP
The effective user
.SM ID
of the process is not privileged user and not the owner of the file, and
.I tvp
is not
\f4NULL\fP.
.TP
\f4EACCES\fP
The effective user
.SM ID
of the process is not privileged user and not the owner of the file, write
permission is denied for the file, and
.I tvp
is
\f4NULL\fP.
.TP
\f4EIO\fP
An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.
.TP
\f4EROFS\fP
The file system containing the file is mounted read-only.
.TP

.I file
or
.I tvp
points outside the process's allocated address space.

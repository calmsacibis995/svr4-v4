.SH NAME
\f4nice\f1 \- change priority of a process
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4cc \f1[ \f2flag\f1\. \. \. ] \f2file\f1 \. \. \. \f4\-lucb\f1
.P
\f4int nice(incr)\f1
.br
\f4int incr;\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
The scheduling priority of the process is augmented by
.IR incr .
Positive priorities get less service than normal.
Priority 10 is recommended to users who wish
to execute long-running programs without
undue impact on system performance.
.P
Negative increments are illegal, except when
specified by the privileged user.
The priority is limited to the range \-20
(most urgent) to 20 (least).
Requests for values above or below these
limits result in the scheduling
priority being set to the corresponding limit.
.P
The priority of a process is passed to a child process by
\f4fork\f1(2).
For a privileged process to return to
normal priority from an unknown state,
\f4nice\f1
should be called successively with
arguments \-40 (goes to priority
\-20 because of truncation), 20 (to get to 0),
then 0 (to maintain compatibility with previous
versions of this call).
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion,
\f4nice\f1
returns 0.
Otherwise, a value of \-1 is returned and
\f4errno\f1
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
The priority is not changed if:
.TP 10
\f4EACCES\fP
The value of
.I incr
specified was negative, and the effective user
.SM ID
is not the privileged user.

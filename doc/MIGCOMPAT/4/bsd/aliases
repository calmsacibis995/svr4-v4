.SH NAME
\f4aliases\f1, \f4addresses\f1, \f4forward\f1 \- addresses and aliases for sendmail
.SH SYNOPSIS
.P

.nf
/etc/aliases
/etc/aliases.dir
/etc/aliases.pag

.ft 1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
These files contain mail addresses or aliases, recognized by
\f4sendmail\f1,
for the local host:
.P
.PD 0
.TP 20
\f4/etc/passwd\f1
Mail addresses (usernames) of local users.
.TP
\f4/etc/aliases\f1
Aliases for the local host, in
\s-1ASCII\s0
format.
This file can be edited to add, update, or delete
local mail aliases.
.TP
\f4/etc/aliases. { dir , pag\f1}
The aliasing information from
\f4/etc/aliases\f1,
in binary,
\f4dbm\f1
format for use by
\f4sendmail\f1.
The program,
\f4newaliases\f1, maintains these files.
.TP
\f4\u\(ap\d/.forward\f1
Addresses to which a user's mail is forwarded (see
\f4Automatic Forwarding\f1,
below).
.PD
.P
In addition, the Network Information Service (NIS) aliases map
\f2mail.aliases\f1
contains addresses and aliases available for use across the network.
.SS Addresses
As distributed,
\f4sendmail\f1
supports the following types of addresses:
.SS Local Usernames
.IP
\f2username\f1
.P
Each local
\f2username\f1
is listed in the local host's
\f4/etc/passwd\f1
file.
.SS Local Filenames
.IP
\f2pathname\f1
.P
Messages addressed to the absolute
\f2pathname\f1
of a file are appended to that file.
.SS Commands
.IP
\f4|\^\f2command\f1
.P
If the first character of the address is a vertical bar,
\f1(\f4\||\|\f1),
\f4sendmail\f1
pipes the message to the standard input of the
\f2command\f1
the bar precedes.
.SS \s-1DARPA\s0-standard Addresses
.IP
\f2username\f4@\f2domain\f1
.P
If
\f2domain\f1
does not contain any
`\f4.\f1'
(dots),
then it is interpreted as the name of a
host in the current domain.
Otherwise, the message is passed to a
\f2mailhost\f1
that determines how to get to the specified domain.
Domains are divided into subdomains separated by
dots, with the top-level domain on the right.
Top-level domains include:
.RS
.TP
Commerical organizations.
.TP
Educational organizations.
.TP
Government organizations.
.TP
Military organizations.
.RE
.P
For example, the full address of John Smith could be:
.IP
\f4js@jsmachine.Podunk-\s-1U.EDU\f1
.P
if he uses the machine named
\f4jsmachine\f1
at Podunk University.
.SS uucp Addresses
.IP
\&.\|.\|. [\c
\f2host\f4!\c\f1
]\c
\f2host\f4!\f2username\f1
.P
These are sometimes mistakenly referred to as ``Usenet'' addresses.
\f4uucp\f1
provides links to numerous sites throughout the world for
the remote copying of files.
.P
Other site-specific forms of addressing can be added by customizing
the
\f4sendmail\f1
configuration file.
See the
\f4sendmail\f1(1M)
for details.
Standard addresses are recommended.

.ne 20
.SS Aliases
.SS Local Aliases
\f4/etc/aliases\f1
is formatted as a series of lines of the form
.IP
\f2aliasname\f4:\f2address\f1[\f4, \f2address\f1]
.P
\f2aliasname\f1
is the name of the alias or alias group, and
\f2address\f1
is the address of a recipient in the group.
Aliases can be nested.
That is, an
\f2address\f1
can be the name of another alias group.
Because of the way
\f4sendmail\f1
performs mapping from upper-case to lower-case, an
\f2address\f1
that is the name of another alias group must not contain any
upper-case letters.
.P
Lines beginning with white space are treated as continuation lines
for the preceding alias.
Lines beginning with
\f4#\f1
are comments.
.SS Special Aliases
.P
An alias of the form:
.IP
\f4owner\- aliasname : \f2address\f1
.P
directs error-messages resulting from mail to
\f2aliasname\f1
to
\f2address\f1,
instead of back to the person who sent the
message.
.P
An alias of the form:
.IP
\f2aliasname\f4:\f1
\f4:include:\f2pathname\f1
.P
with colons as shown, adds the recipients listed in the file
\f2pathname\f1
to the
\f2aliasname\f1
alias.
This allows a private list to be maintained separately from the
aliases file.
.SS NIS Domain Aliases
Normally, the aliases file on the master
\s-1NIS\s0
server is used for the
\f2mail.aliases\f1
\s-1NIS\s0
map, which can be made available to every
\s-1NIS\s0
client.
Thus, the
\f4/etc/aliases*\f1
files on the various hosts in a network will one day be obsolete.
Domain-wide\p
.br
.ne 3
aliases should ultimately be resolved into usernames on
specific hosts.
For example, if the following were in the domain-wide alias file:
.IP
\f4jsmith:js@jsmachine\f1
.P
then any
\s-1NIS\s0
client could just mail to
\f4jsmith\f1
and not have to
remember the machine and username for John Smith.
If a
\s-1NIS\s0
alias does
not resolve to an address with a specific host, then the name of the
\s-1NIS\s0
domain is used.
There should be an alias of the domain name for a host
in this case.
For example, the alias:
.IP
\f4jsmith:root\f1
.P
sends mail on a
\s-1NIS\s0
client to
\f4root@podunk-u\f1
if the name of the
\s-1NIS\s0
domain is
\f4podunk-u\f1.
.SS Automatic Forwarding
When an alias (or address) is resolved to the name of a user on the
local host,
\f4sendmail\f1
checks for a
\f4.forward\f1
file, owned by the intended recipient, in that user's home directory,
and with universal read access.
This file can contain one or more addresses or aliases as described
above, each of which is sent a copy of the user's mail.
.P
Care must be taken to avoid creating addressing loops in the
\f4.forward\f1
file.
When forwarding mail between machines, be sure that the destination
machine does not return the mail to the sender through
the operation of any
\s-1NIS\s0
aliases.
Otherwise, copies of
the message may ``bounce.''
Usually, the solution is to change the
\s-1NIS\s0
alias to direct mail to the proper destination.
.br
.ne 8
.P
A backslash before a username
inhibits further aliasing.
For instance, to invoke the
\f4vacation\f1
program, user
\f4js\f1
creates a
\f4.forward\f1
file that contains the line:
.IP
\f4\ejs, "|/usr/ucb/vacation js"\fP
.P
so that one copy of the message is sent to the
user, and another is piped into the
\f4vacation\f1
program.

Because of restrictions in
\f4dbm\f1
a single alias cannot contain more than about 1000 characters.
Nested aliases can be used to circumvent this limit.

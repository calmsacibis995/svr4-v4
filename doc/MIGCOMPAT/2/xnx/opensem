.SH NAME
\f4opensem\fP \- open a semaphore
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4cc \f1[\f2flag \f1. . .] \f2file\f1 . . . \f4-lx\f1
.br
\f4int opensem(int sem_name, char *sem_num);\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4opensem\fP opens a semaphore named by \f2sem_name\f1 and returns the 
unique semaphore identification number \f2sem_num\f1 used by \f4waitsem\fP 
and \f4sigsem\fP.
\f4creatsem\fP should always be called to initialize 
the semaphore before the first attempt to open it.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
\f4opensem\fP returns a value of \-1 if an error occurs.
If the semaphore
named does not exist, \f4errno\f1 is set to \f4ENOENT\fP.
If the file
specified is not a semaphore file (that is, a file previously created by
a process using a call to \f4creatsem\fP), \f4errno\f1 is set to
\f4ENOTNAM\fP.
If the semaphore has become invalid due to inappropriate
use, \f4errno is set to \f4ENAVAIL\fP.
.SH SEE ALSO
\f4creatsem\fP(2), \f4sigsem\fP(2), \f4waitsem\fP(2)
.SH NOTES
It is not advisable to open the same semaphore more than once.
Although it is possible to do this, it may result in a deadlock.

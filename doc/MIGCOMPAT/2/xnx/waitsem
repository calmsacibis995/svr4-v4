.SH NAME
\f4waitsem\f1, \f4nbwaitsem\fP \- await and check access to a resource governed by a semaphore
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4cc \f1[\f2flag \f1. . .] \f2file\f1 . . . \f4-lx\f1
.PP
\f4waitsem(int sem_num)\fP;
.PP
\f4nbwaitsem(int sem_num)\fP;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4waitsem\fP gives the calling process access to the resource governed
by the semaphore \f2sem_num\f1.
If the resource is in use by another
process, \f4waitsem\fP will put the process to sleep until the resource
becomes available; \f4nbwaitsem\fP will return the error \f4ENAVAIL\fP.
\f4waitsem\fP and \f4nbwaitsem\fP are used in conjunction with 
\f4sigsem\fP to allow synchronization of processes withing to access
a resource.
One or more processes may \f4waitsem\fP on the given
semaphore and will be put to sleep until the process which currently
has access to the resource issues \f4sigsem\fP.
\f4sigsem\fP causes
the process which is next in line on the semaphore's queue to be
rescheduled for execution.
The semaphore's queue is organized in
First In, First Out (FIFO) order.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
\f4waitsem\fP returns the value (int) \-1 if an error occurs.
If \f2sem_num\f1 has not been previously opened by a call to \f4opensem\fP
or \f4creatsem\fP, \f4errno\f1 is set to \f4EBADF\fP.
If \f2sem_num\f1
does not refer to a semaphore type file, \f4errno\f1 is set to \f4ENOTNAM\fP.
All processes waiting (or attempting to wait) on the semaphore return 
with \f4errno\f1 set to \f4ENAVAIL\fP when the process controlling the
semaphore exits without relinquishing control (thereby leaving the 
resource in an undeterminate state).
If a process does two 
\f4waitsems\fP in a row without doing a intervening \f4sigsem\fP,
\f4errno\f1 is set to \f4EINVAL\fP.

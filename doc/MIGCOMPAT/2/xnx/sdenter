.SH NAME
\f4sdenter\f1, \f4sdleave\fP \- synchronize access to a shared data segment
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4cc \f1[\f2flag \f1. . .] \f2file\f1 . . . \f4-lx\f1
.PP
\f4#include <sys/sd.h>\fP
.PP
\f4int sdenter(char *addr, int flags)\fP;
.PP
\f4int sdleave(char *addr)\fP;
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4sdenter\fP is used to indicate that the current process is about to
access the contents of a shared data segment.
The actions performed
depend on the value of \f2flags\f1.
\f2flags\f1 values are formed by
\s-1OR\s0-ing together entries from the following list:
.TP 12
\f4SD_NOWAIT\fP
If another process has called \f4sdenter\fP but not \f4sdleave\fP for
the indicated segment, and the segment was not created with the
\f4SD_UNLOCK\fP flag set, return an \f4ENAVAIL\fP error instead
of waiting for the segment to become free.
.TP
\f4SD_WRITE\fP
Indicates that the process wants to write data to the shared data
segment.
A process that has attached to a shared data segment with
the \f4SD_RDONLY\fP flag set will not be allowed to enter with the
\f4SD_WRITE\fP flag set.
.P
\f4sdleave\fP is used to indicate that the current process is done
modifying the contents of a shared data segment.
.P
Only changes made between invocations of \f4sdenter\fP and \f4sdleave\fP
are guaranteed to be reflected in other processes.
\f4sdenter\fP and
\f4sdleave\fP are very fast; consequently, it is recommended that
they be called frequently rather than leave \f4sdenter\fP in effect
for any period of time.
In particular, system calls should be
avoided between \f4sdenter\fP and \f4sdleave\fP calls.
.P
The \f4fork\fP system call is forbidden between calls to \f4sdenter\fP
and \f4sdleave\fP if the segment was created without the \f4SD_UNLOCK\fP
flag.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Successful calls return 0.
Unsuccessful calls return \-1 and set \f4errno\f1
to indicate the error.
\f4errno\f1 is set to \f4EINVAL\fP if
a process does an \f4sdenter\fP with the \f4SD_WRITE\fP flag set and the
segment is already attached with the \f4SD_RDONLY\fP flag set.
\f4errno\f1 is set to \f4ENAVAIL\fP if the \f4SD_NOWAIT\fP flag is
set for \f4sdenter\fP and the shared data segment is not free.

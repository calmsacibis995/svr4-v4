.SH NAME
\f4sdget\f1, \f4sdfree\f1 \- attach and detach a shared data segment
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4cc \f1[\f2flag \f1. . .] \f2file\f1 . . . \f4-lx\f1
.br
\f4#include <sys/sd.h>\fP
.PP
\f4char *sdget(char *path, int flags, /* long size, int mode */);\fP
.PP
\f4int sdfree(char *addr);\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4sdget\fP attaches a shared data segment to the data space of the
current process.
The actions performed are controlled by the value
of \f2flags\f1.
\f2flags\f1 values are constructed by an
.SM OR
of flags from the following list:
.TP 12
\f4SD_RDONLY\fP
Attach the segment for reading only.
.TP
\f4SD_WRITE\fP
Attach the segment for both reading and writing.
.TP
\f4SD_CREAT\fP
If the segment named by \f2path\f1 exists and is not in use (active),
this flag will have the same effect as creating a segment from scratch.
Otherwise, the segment is created according to the values of \f2size\f1
and \f2mode\f1.
Read and write access to the segment is granted to
other processes based on the permissions passed in \f2mode\f1, and
functions the same as those for regular files.
Execute permission is meaningless.
The segment is initialized to contain all zeroes.
.TP
\f4SD_UNLOCK\fP
If the segment is created because of this call, the segment will be
made so that more than one process can be between \f4sdenter\fP and
\f4sdleave\fP calls.
.P
\f4sdfree\fP detaches the current process from the shared data segment
that is attached at the specified address.
If the current process
has done \f4sdenter\fP but not an \f4sdleave\fP for the specified segment,
\f4sdleave\fP will be done before detaching the segment.
.P
When no process remains attached to the segment, the contents of
that segment disappear, and no process can attach to the segment without
creating it by using the \f4SD_CREAT\fP flag in \f4sdget\fP.
\f4errno\f1
is set to \f4EEXIST\fP if a process tries to create a shared data
segment that exists and is in use.
\f4errno\f1 is set to \f4ENOTNAM\fP
if a process attempts an \f4sdget\fP on a file that exists but is
not a shared data type.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
On successful completion, the address at which the segment was attached
is returned.
Otherwise, \-1 is returned, and \f4errno\f1 is set to
indicate the error.
\f4errno\f1 is set to \f4EINVAL\fP if a process
does an \f4sdget\fP on a shared data segment to which it is already
attached.
\f4errno\f1 is set to \f4EEXIST\fP if a process tries to
create a shared data segment that exists an is in use.
\f4errno\f1
is set to \f4ENOTNAM\fP if a process attempts an \f4sdget\f1 on a
file that exists but is not a shared data type.
.P
The mode parameter must be included on the first call of the \f4sdget\fP
function.

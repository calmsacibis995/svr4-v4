.SH NAME
\f4reboot\f1 \- restart the operating system
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/usr/ucb/reboot\f1
[
\f4\-dnq\f1
]
[
\f2boot arguments\f1
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\f4reboot\f1
restarts the kernel.
The kernel is loaded into memory by the
\s-1PROM\s0
monitor, which transfers control to it.
.P
Although
\f4reboot\f1
can be run by the privileged user at any time,
\f4shutdown\f1(1M)
is normally used first to warn all users logged in of the
impending loss of service.
See
\f4shutdown\f1(1M)
for details.
.P
\f4reboot\f1
performs a
\f4sync\f1(1)
operation on the disks, and then a multiuser reboot is initiated.
See
\f4init\f1(1M)
for details.
.P
\f4reboot\f1
normally logs the reboot to the system log daemon,
\f4syslogd\f1(1M),
and places a shutdown record in the login accounting file
\f4/var/adm/wtmp\f1.
These actions are inhibited if the
\f4\-n\f1
or
\f4\-q\f1
options are present.
.P
The following options are available:
.TP
\f4\-d\f1
Dump system core before rebooting.
This option is provided for compatibility, but is not
supported by the underlying
\f4reboot\f1(3)
call.
.TP
\f4\-n\f1
Avoid the
\f4sync\f1(1).
It can be used if a disk or the processor is on fire.
.TP
\f4\-q\f1
Quick.
Reboots quickly and ungracefully, without first shutting down
running processes.
.TP
.I boot arguments
These arguments are accepted for compatibility,
but are ignored by
\f4reboot\fP.
See
\f4boot\fP(1M)
for details.
.SS "Power Fail and Crash Recovery"
.P
Normally, the system will reboot itself at power-up or after crashes.

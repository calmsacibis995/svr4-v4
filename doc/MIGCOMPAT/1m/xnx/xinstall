.SH NAME
\f4xinstall\f1 \- install commands
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4xinstall\f1 [\f4-c \f2dira\f1] [\f4-f \f2dirb\f1] [\f4-n \f2dirc\f1] [\f4-o\f1] [\f4-a\f1] \f2file\f1 [\f2dirz\f1 . . .]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4xinstall\f1 is a command most commonly used in "makefiles"
[see \f4make\f1(CP)] to xinstall a file
(updated target file) in a specific place within a file system.
Each file is installed by copying it into the appropriate
directory, thereby retaining the mode and owner of the
original command file.
The program prints messages \%telling you exactly what
files it is replacing or creating and where they are going.
.P
If no options or directories (\f2dirz\f1 . . .) are given,
\f4xinstall\f1 will search [using \f4find\f1(C)] a set of
default directories (\f4/usr/bin/usr/usr/bin\f1, \f4/etc\f1,
\f4/usr/lib\f1, and \f4/usr/usr/lib\f1, in that order)
for a file with the same name as \f2file\f1.
When the first occurrence is found,
\f4xinstall\f1 issues a message saying that it is overwriting that file with
\f2file\f1, and proceeds to do so.
If the file is not found, the program states this and exits without
further action.
.P
If one or more directories (\f2dirz\f1 . . .) are specified after \f2file\f1,
those directories will be searched before the directories specified in the
default list.
.P
The meanings of the options are:
.TP .75i
\f4-c\f2 dira\f1
Installs a new command file in the directory specified in \f2dira\f1.
Looks for \f2file\f1 in \f2dira\f1 and xinstalls it there if it is not
found.
If it is found, \f2xinstall\f1 issues a message saying
that the file already exists, and exits without overwriting it.
May be used alone or with the \f4-s\f1 option.
.TP
\f4-f\f2 dirb\f1
Forces \f2file\f1 to be installed in given directory,
whether or not one already exists.
if the file being installed does not already exist,
the mode and owner of the new file will be set to
\f4755\f1 and \f4bin\f1,
respectively.
If the file exists, the mode and owner will be that of the existing file.
May be used alone or with the \f4-o\f1 or \f4-s\f1 options.
.TP
\f4-1\f1
Ignores default directory list,
searching only through the given directories 
(\f2dirz\f1 . . .).
May be used alone or with any other options except \f4-c\f1
and \f4-f\f1.
.TP
\f4-n\f2 dirc\f1
If \f2file\f1 is not found in any of the searched directories,
it is put in the directory specified in \f2dirc\f1.
The mode and owner of the new file will be set to
\f4755\f1 and \f4bin\f1, respectively.
May be used alone or with any other options except
\f4-c\f1 and \f4-f\f1.
.TP
\f4-o\f1
If \f2file\f1 is found, this option saves the "found" file
by copying it to \f2oldfile\f1 in the directory in which is was found.
May be used alone or with any other options except
\f4-c\f1.
.TP
\f4-s\f1
Suppresses printing of messages other than error messages.
May be used alone or with any other options.

.SH NAME
\f4cvtomflib\fP - convert OMF (XENIX) libraries to ELF
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4cvtomflib\fP [\f4-v\fP] [\f4-o\fP \f2outfile\f1] \f2library\fP [\f2library\fP. . .]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4cvtomflib\fP converts libraries of OMF objects to libraries of ELF objects.
It is intended for use with application packages that provide only OMF
libraries that could not otherwise be used with the
Standard C Development Environment.
.P
The options have the following meanings.
.TP
\f4-v\fP
Verbose output is produced for each converted object.
Without this option, \f4cvtomflib\fP does its work silently.
.TP
\f4-o\fP
This option allows the user to specify a new name, \f2outfile\fP, for the
converted library without changing the original.
This option is only available when a single library is being converted.
.SH NOTES
The original order of objects within the library is retained.
.P
Each library is converted in the directory in which it's located.
Without the \f4-o\fP option, the converted library will overwrite the original;
therefore, you may want to copy the original library before conversion.

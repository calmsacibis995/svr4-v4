.SH NAME
\f4fixperm\fP \- correct or initialize file permissions and ownership
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4fixperm \f1[\f4-cDjilnSsvw\f1 [\f4-d \f2package\f1] [\f4-u \f2package\f1]] \f2specfile\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
For each line in the specification file \f2specfile\f1, \f4fixperm\fP
makes the listed pathname conform to a specification.
\f4fixperm\fP is
typically used to configure a \f4XENIX\fP system upon installation.
Nonsuper-users can only use \f4fixperm\fP with the \f4-D, -f, -l,\fP
or \f4-n\fP options.
Only super-users can use the \f4-c,-d,-i,-n,-S, -u,-v,\fP and \f4-w\fP options.
.P
The following options are available:
.TP 15
\f4-c\fP
Creates empty files and missing directories.
.TP
\f4-D\fP
Lists directories only on standard output.
Does not modify target files.
.TP
\f4-d\fP \f2package\f1
Processes input lines beginning with given package specifier string
(see above).
For instance, -d\f4BASE\fP processes only items specified
as belonging to the Basic utilities set.
The default action is to
process all lines.
.TP
\f4-f\fP
Lists files only on standard output.
Does not modify target files.
.TP
\f4-i\fP
Checks only if the selected packages are installed.
Return values are:
.sp .5
.in +.5i
.nf
0: package completely installed
4: package not installed
5: package partially installed
.fi
.in -.5i
.TP 15
\f4-l\fP
Lists files and directories on standard output.
Does not modify target
files.
.TP
\f4-n\fP
Reports errors only.
Does not modify target files.
.TP
\f4-S\fP
Issues a complaint if files are not in x.out format.
.TP
\f4-s\fP
Modifies special device files in addition to the rest of the permlist.
.TP
\f4-u\fP \f2package\f1
Causes similar action to \f4-d\fP option, but processes items that
are not part of the given package.
.TP
\f4-v\fP
Issues a complaint if executable files are: 
.sp .5
.in +.5i
.nf
1) word-swapped
2) not fixed-stack
3) not separate I and D
4) not stripped
.fi
.in -.5i
.TP 15
\f4-w\fP
Lists location (volume number ) of the specified files or directories.
.SH Specification File Format
Each nonblank line in the specification file consists of either a
comment or an item specification.
A comment is any text from a pound
sign ``#'' up to the end of the line.
There is one item specification per line.
User and group id numbers must be specified at the top of
the specification file for each user and group mentioned in the file.
.P
An item specification consists of a package specifier, a permission 
specification, owner and group specifications, the number of links
on the file, the filename, and an optional volume number.
.P
The package specifier is an arbitrary string that is the name of a
package within a distribution set.
A package is a set of files.
.P
A permission specification follows the package specifier.
The permission specification consists of a file type, followed by a
numeric permission specification.
The item specification is one
of the following characters:
.PP
.RS
.PD 0
.TP 5
\f4x\fP
executable
.TP
\f4a\fP
archive
.TP
\f4e\fP
empty file (create if \f4-c\fP option given)
.TP
\f4b\fP
block device
.TP
\f4c\fP
character device
.TP
\f4d\fP
directory
.TP
\f4f\fP
text file
.TP
\f4p\fP
named pipe
.PD
.RE
.P
If the item specification is given as an uppercase letter, the file
associated with it is optional, and \f4fixperm\fP will not return
an error message if it does not exist.
.P
The numeric permission conforms to the scheme described in \f4chmod\fP.
The owner and group permissions are in the third column separated by 
slash, such as ``\f4bin/bin\fP''.
The fourth column indicates the number of links.
If there are links to the file, the next line contains 
the linked filename with no other information.
The fifth column is a pathname.
The pathname must be relative (not preceded by a slash ``/'').
The sixth column is only used for special files, major and minor
device numbers, or volume numbers.
.SH EXAMPLES
The following two lines make a distribution and invoke \f4tar\fP to
archive only the files in \f4base.perms\fP on \f4/dev/sample\fP:
.P
.RS
.ft 4
.nf
/etc/fixperm -f/etc/base.perms>list
tar cfF /dev/sample list
.fi
.ft 1
.RE
.P
This command line reports \f4BASE\fP package errors:
.P
.RS
\f4/etc/fixperm -nd BASE\fP
.RE
.SH NOTES
\f4fixperm\fP is usually only run by a shell script at installation.

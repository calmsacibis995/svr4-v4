.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX  install  ""  "\fLinstall\fP \(em install files"
.IX  "programming tools"  "install"  ""  "\fLinstall\fP \(em install files"
.IX  "system administration"  "install"  ""  "\fLinstall\fP \(em install files"
Install is used within makefiles to copy new versions of
files into a destination directory and to create the destination
directory itself.
.P
The first two forms are similar to the
\f4cp\f1(1)
command with the addition
that executable files can be stripped during the copy and the
owner, group, and mode of the installed file(s) can be given.
.P
The third form can be used to create a destination directory with
the required owner, group and permissions.
.P
Note:
\f4install\f1
uses no special privileges to copy files from one place to another.
The implications of this are:

You must have permission to copy into the destination file or directory.
.TP 3
\(bu
You must have permission to change the modes on the final copy of the
file if you want to use the
\f4\-m\f1
option to change modes. 
.TP 3
\(bu
You must be superuser if you want to specify the ownership of the
installed file with
\f4\-o\f1.
If you are not the super-user, or if
\f4\-o\f1
is not in effect, the installed file will be owned by you,
regardless of who owns the original.

.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4lpr\f1
forwards printer jobs to a spooling area for subsequent printing as
facilities become available.
Each printer job consists of copies of,
or, with
\f4\-s ,\f1
complete pathnames of
each
.I filename
you specify.
The spool area is managed by the line printer spooler,
\f4lpsched\f1.
\f4lpr\f1
reads from the standard input if no files are specified.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 15
\f4\-P \f2printer\f1
Send output to the named
.IR printer .
Otherwise send output to the printer named in the
\f4PRINTER\fP
environment variable, or to the default printer,
\f4lp\f1.
.TP
\f4\-# \f2copies\f1
Produce the number of
.I copies
indicated for each named file.
For example:
.RS
.IP
\f4lpr \-#3 index.c lookup.c\f1
.RE
.IP
produces three copies of
\f4index.c\f1,
followed by three copies of
\f4lookup.c\f1.
On the other hand,
.RS
.IP
\f4cat index.c lookup.c | lpr \-#3\f1
.RE
.IP
generates three copies of the concatenation of the files.
.TP
\f4\-C \f2class\f1
Print
.I class
as the job classification on the
burst page.
For example,
.RS
.IP
\f4lpr \-C Operations new.index.c\f1
.RE
.IP
replaces the system name (the name returned by
.IR hostname )
with \f5Operations\fP on the burst page, and prints the file
\f4new.index.c\fP.
.TP
\f4\-J \f2job\f1
Print
.I job
as the job name on the
burst page.
Normally,
\f4lpr\f1
uses the first file's name.
.TP
\f4\-T  \f2title\f1
Use
.I title
instead of the file name for the title
used by
\f4pr\f1(1).
.TP
\f4\-i\f1[\f2indent\f1]\f1
Indent output
.I indent
.SM SPACE
characters.
Eight
.SM SPACE
characters is the default.
.TP
\f4\-w \f2cols\f1
Use
.I cols
as the page width for
\f4pr\f1.
.TP
\f4\-r\f1
Remove the file upon completion of spooling,
or upon completion of printing with the
\f4\-s\f1
option.
This is not supported in the SunOS compatibility
package.
However if the job is submitted to a  
remote SunOS system, these options will be sent 
to the remote system for processing.
.TP
\f4\-m\f1
Send mail upon completion.
.TP
\f4\-h\f1
Suppress printing the burst page.
.TP
\f4\-s\f1
Use the full pathnames (not symbolic links) of the files to be printed 
rather than trying to copy
them.
This means the data files should
not be modified or removed until they
have been printed.
\f4\-s\f1
only prevents copies of local files from being made.
Jobs from
remote hosts are copied anyway.
\f4\-s\f1
only works with named data files; if the
\f4lpr\f1
command is at the end of a pipeline, the data is copied to the
spool.
.br
.ne 10
.TP
.I filter_option
The following single letter options notify the line printer
spooler that the files are not standard text files.
The spooling daemon will use the appropriate filters to
print the data accordingly.
.ne 12
.RS
.TP
\f4\-p\f1
.PD 0
Use
\f4pr\f1
to format the files
(\f4lpr \-p\f1
is very much like
\f4pr | lpr\f1).
.TP
\f4\-l\f1
Print control characters and suppress page breaks.
.TP
\f4\-t\f1
The files contain
\f4troff\f1(1)
(cat phototypesetter) binary data.
.TP
\f4\-n\f1
The files contain data from
\f4ditroff\f1
(device independent troff).
.TP
\f4\-d\f1
The files contain data from
\f4tex\f1
(\s-1DVI\s0
format from Stanford).
.TP
\f4\-g\f1
The files contain standard plot data as produced by the
\f4plot\f1(3X)
routines (see also
\f4plot\f1(1G)
for the filters used by the printer spooler).
.TP
\f4\-v\f1
The files contain a raster image.
The printer must support an appropriate imaging model such as
PostScript\(rg in order to print the image.
.TP
\f4\-c\f1
The files contain data produced by
.IR cifplot .
.TP
\f4\-f\f1
Interpret the first character of each line as a standard
.SM FORTRAN
carriage control character.
.PD
.P
If no
.I filter_option
is given (and the printer can interpret PostScript), the string
\f1`\f4%!\f1'
as the first two characters of a file indicates that it
contains PostScript commands.
.P
These filter options offer a standard user interface,
and all options may not be available for, nor applicable to,
all printers.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP
\f4lpr: \f2printer\fP\|: unknown printer\f1
The
\f4printer\f1
was not found in the
.SM LP
database.
Usually this is a typing mistake; however, it 
may indicate that the printer does not exist on the system.
Use 
\f1`\f4lptstat \-p\f1'
to find the reason.
.TP
\f4lpr: error on opening queue to spooler\f1
The connection to
\f4lpsched\f1
on the local machine failed.
This usually means the printer server started at
boot time has died or is hung.
Check if the printer
spooler daemon 
\f4/usr/lib/lpsched\f1
is running.
.TP
\f4lpr: \f2printer\fP\|: printer queue is disabled\f1
This means the queue was turned off with
.RS
.IP
\f4/usr/etc/lpc disable \f2printer\f1
.RE
.IP
to prevent
\f4lpr\f1
from putting files in the queue.
This is normally
done by the system manager when a printer is
going to be down for a long time.
The
printer can be turned back on by a privileged user with
\f4lpc\f1.
.TP
\f4lpr: Can't send message to the LP print service\f1
.TP
\f4lpr: Can't receive message from the LP print service\f1
These indicate that the 
.SM LP
print service has been 
stopped.
Get help from the system administrator. 
.TP
\f4lpr: Received unexpected message from LP print service\f1
It is likely there is an error in this software.
Get help from system administrator.
.TP
\f4lpr: There is no filter to convert the file content\f1
Use the
\f1`\f4lpstat \-p\  \-l\f1'
command to find a printer that can handle 
the file type directly, or consult with your system 
administrator.
.TP 
\f4lpr: cannot access the file\f1
Make sure file names are valid.

.SH NOTES
\f4lp\f1 is the preferred interface.
.P
Command-line options cannot be combined into a single argument
as with some other commands.
The command:
.IP
\f4lpr \-fs\f1
.P
is not equivalent to
.IP
\f4lpr \-f \-s\f1
.P
Placing the
\f4\-s\f1
flag first, or writing each option as a separate argument, makes a link
as expected.
.P
\f4lpr \-p\f1
is not precisely
equivalent
to
\f4pr | lpr\f1.
\f4lpr \-p\f1
puts the current date at the top of each page, rather
than the date last modified.
.P
Fonts for
\f4troff\f1(1)
and
\s-1T\s-1\dE\u\s+1X\s+1\(rg
reside on the printer host.
It is currently not possible to use local font libraries.
.P
\f4lpr\f1
objects to printing binary files.
.P
The
\f4\-s\f1
option, intended to use symbolic links in SunOS, does not use 
symbolic links in the compatibility package.
Instead, the complete path names are used.
Also, the copying is avoided only for print jobs that are 
run from the printer host itself.
Jobs added to the queue from 
a remote host are always copied into the spool area.
That is, if 
the printer does not reside on the host that
\f4lpr\f1
is run from, the spooling system makes a copy the file to print,
and places it in the spool area of the printer host, regardless of
\f4\-s\f1.

.SH NAME
\f4sum\f1 \- calculate a checksum for a file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/usr/ucb/sum\f1
.I filename
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4sum\f1
calculates and displays a 16-bit checksum for the named file,
and also displays the size of the file in kilobytes.
It is typically used to look for bad spots, or
to validate a file communicated over
some transmission line.
The checksum is calculated by an algorithm which may yield different results
on machines with 16-bit
\f4int\f1s
and machines with 32-bit
\f4int\f1s,
so it cannot
always be used to validate that a file
has been transferred between machines
with different-sized
\f4int\f1s.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
\f4wc\fP(1),
\f4sum\fP(1)
in the \f2User's Reference Manual\f1
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
\f4Read error\f1
is indistinguishable from
.SM EOF
on most devices; check the block count.
.SH NOTES
Obsolescent.

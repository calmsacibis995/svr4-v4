.SH NAME
\f4df\f1 \- report free disk space on file systems
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4df\f1 [\f4\-a\f1] [\f4\-i\f1] [\f4\-t \f2type\f1] [\f2filesystem\f1 .\ .\ . ]
[\f2filename\f1 .\ .\ . ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX "df command"  ""  "\fLdf\fP \(em display free space"
.IX "file system"  "free space display"
.IX "file system"  "display free space"
.IX display  "free space in file system"
\f4df\f1
displays the amount of disk space occupied by currently mounted file systems,
the amount of used and available space,
and how much of the file system's total capacity has been used.
Used without arguments,
\f4df\f1
reports on all mounted file systems, 
producing something like:
.sp .5v
.RS
.nf
.ft 4
.ta \w'Filesystem'u+2n +\w'kbytes'u+2n +\w'used'u+2n +\w'avail'u+2n +\w'capacity'u+2n
Filesystem	kbytes	used	avail	capacity	Mounted on
/dev/root	 7445	4714	1986	  70%		/
/dev/0s10	 5148	3279	1868	  64%		/stand
.fi
.ft 1
.RE
.sp .5v
.P
Note that \f4used\fP+\f4avail\fP is less than the
amount of space in the file system
(kbytes); this is because the system
reserves a fraction of the space
in the file system to allow its file
system allocation routines to work well.
The amount reserved is typically about 10%;
this may be adjusted using
\f4tunefs\f1(1M).
When all the space on a file system except for this reserve is
in use, only the super-user can allocate new files and data blocks
to existing files.  When a file system is overallocated in this way,
\f4df\f1 may report that the file system is more than 100% utilized.
.P
If arguments to
\f4df\f1
are disk partitions (for example,
\f4/dev/root\f1
or
\f2pathnames\f1,
\f4df\f1
produces a report on the
file system containing the named file.
Thus \f4df .\f1
shows the amount of space on the file system containing the current
directory.
.SS Options
The options for \f4df\fP are as follows:
.TP .6i
\f4\-a\f1
Reports on all filesystems including the uninteresting
ones which have zero total blocks.
(For example, \f2automounter\f1)
.TP
\f4\-i\f1
Report the number of used and free inodes.
.TP
\f4\-t \ \f2type\f1
Report on filesystems of a given
\f2type\f1 (for example, \f4nfs\f1 or \f44.2\f1).
.SH FILES
.TP 1i
\f4/etc/mtab\f1
List of filesystems currently mounted.

.SH NAME
\f4tcopy\f1 \- copy a magnetic tape
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/usr/ucb/tcopy\f1
.I source
[
.I destination
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\f4tcopy\f1
copies the magnetic tape mounted on the tape drive specified by the
.IR source
argument. 
The only assumption made about the contents of a tape is
that there are two tape marks at the end.
.P
When only a source drive is specified,
\f4tcopy\f1
scans the tape, and displays information about the sizes of records
and tape files. 
If a destination is specified,
\f4tcopy\f1
makes a copies the source tape onto the
.I destination
tape, with blocking preserved.
As it copies,
\f4tcopy\f1
produces the same output as it does when only scanning a tape.

associated set of \f4ioctl\f1(2) requests.

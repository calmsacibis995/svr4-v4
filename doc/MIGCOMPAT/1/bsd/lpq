.SH NAME
\f4lpq\f1 \- display the queue of printer jobs
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4lpq\f1
displays the contents of a printer queue.
It reports the status of
jobs specified by
.IR job# ,
or all jobs owned by the user specified by
.IR username .
\f4lpq\f1
reports on all jobs in the default printer queue when invoked with no
arguments.
.P
For each print job in the queue,
\f4lpq\f1
reports the user's name, current position, the names of input
files comprising the job, the job number (by which it is
referred to when using
\f4lprm\f1(1))
and the total size in bytes.
Normally, only as much information as will fit on one line
is displayed.
Jobs are normally queued on a first-in-first-out basis.
Filenames comprising a job may be unavailable, such as when
\f4lpr\f1
is used at the end of a pipeline; in such cases the filename field
indicates the standard input.
.P
If
\f4lpq\f1
warns that there is no daemon present
(that is, due to some malfunction), the
\f4lpc\f1(1M)
command can be used to restart a printer daemon.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 15
\f4\-P\f2 printer\f1
Display information about the queue for the specified
.IR printer .
In the absence of the
\f4\-P\f1
option, the queue to the printer specified by the
\f4PRINTER\fP
variable in the environment is used.
If the
\f4PRINTER\fP
variable is not set, the queue for the default printer is used.
.TP
\f4\-l\f1
Display queue information in long format; includes the name of
the host from which the job originated.
.TP
\f4\(pl\f1[ \f2interval\f1 ]
Display the spool queue periodically until it empties.
This option
clears the terminal screen before reporting on the queue.
If an
.I  interval
is supplied,
\f4lpq\f1
sleeps that number of seconds in between reports.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP
\f4\f2printer\f4 is printing\f1
The
\f4lpq\f1
program queries the spooler
\f4LPSCHED\fP
about the status of
the printer.
If the printer is disabled, the superuser can 
restart the spooler using 
\f4lpc\f1(1M).
.TP
\f4\f2printer\f4 waiting for auto-retry (offline ?)\f1
The daemon could not open the printer device.
The printer may be
turned off-line.
This message can also occur if a printer is out
of paper, the paper is jammed, and so on.
Another possible cause is
that a process, such as an output filter, has exclusive use of the
device.
The only recourse in this case is to kill the offending
process and restart the printer with
\f4lpc\f1.
.TP
\f4waiting for \f2host\f4 to come up\f1
A daemon is trying to connect to the remote machine named
.IR host ,
in order to send the files in the local queue.
If the remote machine is up,
\f4lpd\f1
on the remote machine is probably dead or
hung and should be restarted using
\f4lpc\fP.
.br
.ne 5
.TP
\f4sending to \f2host\f1
The files are being transferred to the remote
.IR host ,
or else the local daemon has hung while trying to transfer the
files.
.TP
\f4printer disabled reason:\f1
The printer has been marked as being unavailable with
\f4lpc\f1.
.TP
\f4lpq: The LP print service isn't running or can't be reached.\f1
The
\f4lpsched\f1
process
overseeing
the spooling queue does not exist.
This normally occurs
only when the daemon has unexpectedly died.
You can
restart the printer daemon with
\f4lpc\f1.
.TP
\f4lpr: \f2printer\fP\|: unknown printer\f1
The
\f4printer\f1
was not found in the
System V
.SM LP
database.
Usually this is a typing mistake; however, it 
may indicate that the printer does not exist on the system.
Use
\f1`\f4lptstat \-p\f1'
to find the reason.
.TP
\f4lpr: error on opening queue to spooler\f1
The connection to
\f4lpsched\f1
on the local machine failed.
This usually means the printer server started at
boot time has died or is hung.
Check if the printer
spooler daemon
\f4/usr/lib/lpsched\f1
is running.
.TP
\f4lpr: Can't send message to LP print service\f1
.TP
\f4lpr: Can't receive message from LP print service\f1
These indicate that the
.SM LP
print service has been 
stopped.
Get help from the system administrator. 
.TP
\f4lpr: Received unexpected message from LP print service\f1
It is likely there is an error in this software.
Get help from system administrator.

.SH NOTES
Output formatting is sensitive to the line length of the terminal;
this can result in widely-spaced columns.

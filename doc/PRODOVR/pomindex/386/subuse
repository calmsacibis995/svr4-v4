.BK "Product Overview and Master Index"
.CH "Master Subject Index" "3"
.H 1 "Using the Subject Index"
Entries in the index point to guide material and\/or
manual pages.
Manual pages are concise, comprehensive reference information
that was written with the expectation that readers are
somewhat familiar with the material.
Guide
information is more explanatory and procedural.
.sp
The example below illustrates an entry for the term \f4find\fP(1).
The word \f4find\fP is printed in constant width typeface because
it is a literal; that is,
it is either typed in by the user or
printed out by the system.
The index includes both literal and non-literal entries.

Whenever you see a number in parentheses following an entry, such as (1)
in the example above, it indicates that there is a manual page for
that term.
In these cases, at least one of the references
is given without chapter and page numbers, pointing to the book where
the manual page can be found.
In the example, the \s-2\fHURM\fP\s0 contains the \f4find\fP(1) manual page.
Manual pages are arranged alphabetically in numbered sections and
therefore no chapter and page numbers apply to them.
Simply go to the referenced book and look for the term alphabetically
in the appropriate section.

References to guide material appear in the index as follows:

.ps +3
.sp
In the above example, \s-3\fHSAG 5: 40, 8: 4, 6\fP\s+3 indicates that there is guide
information on \f4find\fP in the \f2System Administrator's Guide\fP,
chapter 5, page 40 and chapter 8, pages 4 and 6.
.sp
If you see a letter where a chapter number is usually
given, it means that information is located in
an appendix with that alphabetic name.

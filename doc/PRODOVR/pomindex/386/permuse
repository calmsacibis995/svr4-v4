.BK "Product Overview and Master Index"
.CH "Permuted Index" "2"
.H 1 "Using the Permuted Index"
The comprehensive permuted index directs you to
manual pages located throughout the
UNIX System Documentation Set
with the exception of the graphics books.
Manual pages are concise reference pages that assume
some familiarity with the information.
Detailed discussions and procedures on select topics are covered in the guide
volumes and can be found using the subject index.
.H 2 "How the Permuted Index Is Created"
Many users find that understanding a few things about how the
permuted index is created helps them to read it more
effectively and clarifies what kind of information can and cannot
be obtained from it.
.P
The basic building block for the index is the one-line
description given in the NAME
line on the top of each manual page.
For example, this is what the top of
the \f4mountall\f1(1M) manual
page looks like:
.TS
center expand ;
l c r .
_
.SP
\s-2\f(HBmountall(1M)	(Essential Utilities)	mountall(1M)\fP\s0
.TE
.DS
\s-1\f(HBNAME\fP
	\f4mountall, umountall\f1 \-  mount, unmount multiple file systems\s0
.DE
.TS
center expand ;
l r.
_
 	 
.TE
Each NAME line includes:
.BL
.LI
the command, file format, system call
or other utility for which the manual page
is named (this is the primary utility; \f4mountall\fP
is the primary utility in the example)
.LI
secondary utilities, which are also described on that
manual page and do not have a separate manual page of
their own (\f4umountall\fP is a secondary utility in the example)
.LI
a brief description of the utility function(s)
.LE
.P
For each manual page \s-2NAME\s+2 line, the indexing software
generates several index entries, generally one entry for each
keyword in the phrase.
The middle column of the index is alphabetized on these keywords.
.P
For:
.DS I
\s-1\f(HBNAME\fP
	\f4mountall, umountall\f1 \-  mount, unmount multiple file systems\s0
.DE
.P
This is generated:
.DS
.Px
.xx "" "mount, unmount multiple" "file systems." "/umountall:" mountall(1M)\0\s-1\fHSARM\fP\s0
.xx "systems." "mountall, umountall:" "mount, unmount multiple file" "" mountall(1M)\0\s-1\fHSARM\fP\s0
.xx "unmount multiple file systems." "" "mountall, umountall: mount," "" mountall(1M)\0\s-1\fHSARM\fP\s0
.xx "" "/umountall: mount, unmount" "multiple file systems." "" mountall(1M)\0\s-1\fHSARM\fP\s0
.xx "" "mount, unmount multiple file" "systems." "mountall, umountall:" mountall(1M)\0\s-1\fHSARM\fP\s0
.xx "multiple file/" "mountall," "umountall: mount, unmount" "" mountall(1M)\0\s-1\fHSARM\fP\s0
.xx "" "mountall, umountall: mount," "unmount multiple file systems." "" mountall(1M)\0\s-1\fHSARM\fP\s0
.DE
.H 2 "How to Use the Index"
Look in the middle column of the index for the word of interest.
Then read the complete phrase by starting with the utility
name, which may appear in the left or middle column.
Utility names are followed by a colon.
A period marks the end of the description from the NAME line. 
.P
The NAME line phrase is contained in the two columns, with
long phrases wrapping around to the beginning of the left column.
The right column of the index provides the manual page name, section number,
and acronym for the book where it is located.
.P
A slash (\f4/\fP) sometimes
appears in the index entry to indicate that space limitations were
exceeded and one or more words from the phrase were deleted.

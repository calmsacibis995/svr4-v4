\f4sccsfile\f1 \- format of \s-1SCCS\s+1 file
.SH DESCRIPTION
An \*(S) (Source Code Control System) file is an
.SM ASCII
file.
It consists of six logical parts:
the checksum,
the delta table
(contains information about each delta),
user names
(contains login names and/or numerical group \s-1ID\s+1s of users who may add deltas),
flags
(contains definitions of internal keywords),
comments
(contains arbitrary descriptive information about the file),
and the
body
(contains the actual text lines intermixed with control lines).
.PP
Throughout an \*(S) file there are lines which begin with the
.SM "ASCII SOH"
(start of heading) character (octal 001).
This character is hereafter referred to as
the control character
and will be represented graphically as \f4@\f1.
Any line described below that is not depicted as beginning with
the control character is prevented from beginning
with the control character.
.PP
Entries of the form
\*(D)
represent a five-digit string
(a number between 00000 and 99999).
.PP
Each logical part of an \*(S) file is described in detail below.
.SS Checksum
The checksum is the first line of an \*(S) file.
The form of the line is:
.PP
.RS
\f4@h\*(D)\f1
.RE
.P
The value of the checksum is the sum of all characters, except
those of the first line.
The \f4@h\f1 provides a
magic number
of (octal) 064001, depending on byte order.
.SS "Delta table"
The delta table consists of a variable number of entries of one of the following forms:
.P
.RS
.nf
\f4@s\f1 \*(D)/\*(D)/\*(D)
\f4@d\f1 <\f2type\f1> <\f2\s-1SCCS ID\s+1\f1>  \f2yr/mo/da hr:mi:se\f1  <\f2pgmr\f1>  \*(D)  \*(D)
\f4@i\f1 \*(D) \f4...\f1
\f4@x\f1 \*(D) \f4...\f1
\f4@g\f1 \*(D) \f4...\f1
\f4@m\f1 <\*(M) \f2number\f1>
  \f1. . .
\f4@c\f1 <\f2comments\f1> . . .
  \f1. . .
\f4@e\f1
.fi
.RE
.P
The first line
(\f4@s\f1)
contains the number of lines
inserted/deleted/unchanged, respectively.
The second line
(\f4@d\f1)
contains the type of the delta
(normal: \f4D\f1
or
removed: \f4R\f1),
the \*(S) \s-1ID\s+1 of the delta,
the date and time of creation of the delta, the
login name corresponding to the real user \s-1ID\s+1
at the time the delta was created,
and the serial numbers of the delta and its predecessor,
respectively.
.P
The \f4@i\f1, \f4@x\f1, and \f4@g\f1 lines contain the serial
numbers of deltas included, excluded, and ignored, respectively.
These lines are optional.
.P
The \f4@m\f1 lines (optional) each contain one \*(M) number 
associated with the delta; the \f4@c\f1 lines contain comments
associated with the delta.
The \f4@e\f1 line ends the delta table entry.
.SS "User names"
The list of login names and/or numerical group \s-1ID\s+1s of users 
who may add deltas to the file, separated by new-lines.
The lines
containing these login names and/or numerical group \s-1ID\s+1s are
surrounded by the bracketing lines \f4@u\f1 and \f4@U\f1.
An empty
list allows anyone to make a delta.
Any line starting with a
\f4!\f1
prohibits the succeeding group or user from making deltas.
.SS "Flags"
Keywords used internally.
See
\f4admin\f1(1)
for more information on their use.
Each flag line takes the form:
.P
.RS
\f4@f\f1 <\f2flag\f1>	<\f2optional text\f1>
.RE
.P
The following flags are defined:
.P
.RS
.TS
l1 l2f2 l2 .
\f4@f t\f1	<type of program>
\f4@f v\f1	<program name>
\f4@f i\f1	<keyword string>
\f4@f b\f1
\f4@f m\f1	<module name>
\f4@f f\f1	<floor>
\f4@f c\f1	<ceiling>
\f4@f d\f1	<default-sid>
\f4@f n\f1
\f4@f j\f1
\f4@f l\f1	<lock-releases>
\f4@f q\f1	<user defined>
\f4@f z\f1	<reserved for use in interfaces>
.TE
.RE
.P
The
\f4t\f1
flag defines the replacement for
the \f4%\&Y%\f1 identification keyword.
The
\f4v\f1
flag controls prompting for \*(M) numbers
in addition to comments;
if the optional text is present it defines
an \*(M) number validity
checking program.
The
\f4i\f1
flag controls the warning/error
aspect of the ``\f5No id keywords\fP'' message.
When the
\f4i\f1
flag is not present,
this message is only a warning;
when the
\f4i\f1
flag is present,
this message causes a fatal error
(the file will not be ``gotten'', or the delta will not be made).
When the
\f4b\f1
flag is present
the
\f4\-b\f1
keyletter may be used on the
\f4get\f1
command to cause a branch in the delta tree.
The
\f4m\f1
flag defines the first choice
for the replacement text of the \f4%\&M%\f1 identification keyword.
The
\f4f\f1
flag defines the floor release;
the release below which no deltas may be added.
The
\f4c\f1
flag defines the ceiling release;
the release above which no deltas may be added.
The
\f4d\f1
flag defines the default \*(I) to be used
when none is specified on a
\f4get\f1
command.
The
\f4n\f1
flag causes
\f4delta\f1
to insert a null delta (a delta that applies no changes)
in those releases that are skipped when a delta is made in a new
release (e.g., when delta 5.1 is made after delta 2.7, releases 3 and
4 are skipped).
The absence of the
\f4n\f1
flag causes skipped releases to be completely empty.
The
\f4j\f1
flag causes
\f4get\f1
to allow
concurrent edits of the same base \*(I).
The
\f4l\f1
flag defines a
\f2list\f1
of releases that are locked against editing.
The
\f4q\f1
flag defines the replacement for the \f4%\&Q%\f1 identification keyword.
The
\f4z\f1
flag is used in specialized interface programs.
.SS "Comments"
Arbitrary text is surrounded by the bracketing lines \f4@t\f1 and \f4@T\f1.
The comments section typically will contain a description of the file's purpose.
.SS "Body"
The body consists of text lines and control lines.
Text lines do not begin with the control character,
control lines do.
There are three kinds of control lines:
insert, delete, and end,
represented by:
.P
.RS
.nf
\f4@I\f1 \*(D)
\f4@D\f1 \*(D)
\f4@E\f1 \*(D)
.fi
.RE
.P
respectively.
The digit string is the serial number corresponding to the delta for the
control line.

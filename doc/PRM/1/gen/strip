.SH NAME
\f4strip\f1 \- strip symbol table, debugging and line 
number information from an object file.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4strip\f1 [\f4\-blrVx\f1] \f2file\f1 .\ .\ .
.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
\f4strip\fP
command strips the symbol table, debugging information,
and line number information
from \f4ELF\fP object files; \f4COFF\fP object files can
no longer be stripped.
Once this
stripping process has been done, no symbolic debugging access
will be available for that file; therefore, this command is
normally run only on production modules that have
been debugged and tested.
.PP
If \f4strip\fP is executed on a common archive file
[see \f4ar\fP(4)] in addition to processing the members,
\f4strip\f1 will remove the archive symbol table.
The archive
symbol table must be restored by executing the
\f4ar\fP(1) command with the \f4-s\f1
option before the archive can be
linked by the
\f4ld\fP(1)
command.
\f4strip\fP
will produce appropriate warning messages when this
situation arises.
.PP
The amount of information stripped from the \f4ELF\fP object file
can be controlled by using any of the 
following options:
.PP
.TP 9
\f4\-b\f1
Same effect as the default behavior.
This option is obsolete
and will be removed in the next release.
.PP
.TP 9
\f4\-l\f1
Strip line number information only;
do not strip the symbol table or debugging information.
.PP
.TP 9
\f4\-r\f1
Same effect as the default behavior.
This option is obsolete
and will be removed in the next release.
.PP
.TP 9
\f4\-V\f1
Print, on standard error, the version number of \f4strip\fP.
.PP
.TP 9
\f4\-x\f1
Do not strip the symbol table;
debugging and line number information may be stripped.
.DT
.br
.PP
\f4strip\fP is used to reduce the file storage
overhead taken by the object file.
.SH "FILES"
.TP 20
\f2TMPDIR\f1/strp\(**
temporary files
.TP
\f2TMPDIR\f1
usually \f4/var/tmp\fP but can be redefined by setting the
environment variable
\f4TMPDIR\f1
[see \f4tempnam\fP() in \f4tmpnam\fP(3S)].

.SH "NOTES"
.PP
The symbol table section will not be removed if it is contained
within a segment, or the file is either a relocatable 
or  dynamic shared object.
.PP
The line number and debugging sections will not be removed if they
are contained within a segment, or their associated relocation
section is contained within a segment.

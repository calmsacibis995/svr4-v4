.SH NAME
\f4mcs\f1 \- manipulate the comment section of an object file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4mcs\f1
\f1[\f4\-a\f2 string\f1]
\f1[\f4\-c\f1]
\f1[\f4\-d\f1]
\f1[\f4\-n\f2 name\f1]
\f1[\f4\-p\f1]
\f1[\f4\-V\f1]
\f2file\f1 . . .
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\f4mcs\fP
command is used to manipulate a section, by default the \f4.comment\f1
section, in an ELF object file.
It is used to add to, delete, print, and compress the contents of a
section in an 
ELF
object file, and only print the contents of a
section in a COFF object file.
\f4mcs\fP
must be given one or more of the options described below.
It applies each of the options in order to each file.
.P
The following options are available.
.TP
\f4\-a\f2 string\f1
Append
.I string
to the comment section of the
object files.
If 
.I string
contains embedded blanks,
it must be enclosed in quotation marks.
.TP
\f4\-c\f1
Compress the contents of the comment section of the ELF
object files.
All duplicate entries are removed.
The ordering of the remaining entries is not disturbed.
.TP
\f4\-d\f1
Delete the contents of the comment section from the ELF
object files.
The section header for the comment section is also removed.
.TP
\f4\-n\f2 name\f1
Specify the name of the comment section to access
if other than \%\f4.comment\f1.
By default, \f4mcs\fP deals with the section named \f4.comment\fP.
This option can be used to specify another section.
.TP
\f4\-p\f1
Print the contents of the comment section on the standard output.
Each section printed is tagged by the
name of the file from which it was extracted, using the
format \f2filename\f4[\f2member_name\f4]:\f1 for archive files;
and \f2filename\f4:\f1 for other files.
.TP
\f4\-V\f1
Print, on standard error, the
version number of \f4mcs\fP.
.P
If the input file is an archive [see
\f4ar\fP(4)], 
the archive is treated as a set of individual files.
For example,
if the \f4\-a\fP option is specified, the string is appended to the
comment section of each ELF
object file in the archive;
if the archive member
is not an ELF object file,
then it is left unchanged.
.P
If
\f4mcs\fP
is executed on an archive file 
the archive symbol table will be removed, unless only the 
\f4\-p\fP
option has been specified.
The archive
symbol table must be restored by executing the
\f4ar\fP command with the
\f4\-s\f1
option before the archive can be
linked by the
\f4ld\fP
command.
\f4mcs\fP
will produce appropriate warning messages when this
situation arises.

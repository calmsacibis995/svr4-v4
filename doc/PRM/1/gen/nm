.SH NAME
\f4nm\f1 \- print name list of an object file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4nm\f1
[ \f4\-oxhvnefurplVT\f1 ]
\f2files\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\f4nm\f1
command
displays the symbol table of each
\s-1ELF\s+1 or \s-1COFF\s+1 object file,
specified by
.IR file(s) .
The file
may be a relocatable or absolute \s-1ELF\s+1 or \s-1COFF\s+1 object file;
or it may be an archive of relocatable or absolute \s-1ELF\s+1 or \s-1COFF\s+1 object files.
For each symbol, the following information will be printed:
.PP
.TP 9
\f4Index\f1
The index of the symbol.
(The index appears in brackets.) 
.PP
.TP 9
\f4Value\f1
The value of the symbol is one of the following:
a section offset for defined symbols in a relocatable file;
alignment constraints for symbols whose section index is
\f4SHN_COMMON\f1;
a virtual address in executable and dynamic library files.
.PP
.TP 9
\f4Size\f1
The size in bytes of the associated object.
.nr C 1
.if '\*p'n3b' .nr C 0
.if '\*p'm32' .nr C 0
.if \nC \{\
.PP
.TP 9
\f4Type\f1
A symbol is of one of the following types:
\f4NOTYPE\f1 (no type was specified),
\f4OBJECT\f1 (a data object such as an array or variable),
\f4FUNC\f1 (a function or other executable code),
\f4SECTION\f1 (a section symbol), or
\f4FILE\f1 (name of the source file).
.PP
.TP 9
\f4Bind\f1
The symbol's binding attributes.
\f4LOCAL\f1 symbols have a scope limited to the
object file containing their definition;
\f4GLOBAL\f1 symbols are visible to all object files being combined;
and \f4WEAK\f1 symbols are essentially global symbols with
a lower precedence than \f4GLOBAL\f1.
.PP
.TP 9
\f4Other\f1
A field reserved for future use, currently containing 0.
.PP
.TP 9
\f4Shndx\f1
Except for three special values, this is the section header table index
in relation to which the symbol is defined.
The following special values exist:
\f4ABS\f1 indicates the symbol's value will not change
through relocation;
\f4COMMON\f1 indicates an unallocated block and the value provides alignment
constraints;
and
\f4UNDEF\f1 indicates an undefined symbol.
.PP
.TP 9
\f4Name\f1
The name of the symbol.
.DT
.br
.PP
The output of
\f4nm\f1
may be controlled using the following options:
.PP
.TP 9
\f4\-o\f1
Print the value and size of a symbol
in octal instead of decimal.
.PP
.TP 9
\f4\-x\f1
Print the value and size of a symbol
in hexadecimal instead of decimal.
.PP
.TP 9
\f4\-h\f1
Do not display the output heading data.
.PP
.TP 9
\f4\-v\f1
Sort external symbols by value before they are printed.
.PP
.TP 9
\f4\-n\f1
Sort external symbols by name before they are printed.
.TP 9
\f4\-e\f1
See \s-1NOTES\s0 below.
.TP 9
\f4\-f\f1
See \s-1NOTES\s0 below.
.TP 9
\f4\-u\f1
Print undefined symbols only.
.TP
\f4\-r\f1
Prepend the name of the object file or archive to each output line.
.TP
\f4\-p\f1
Produce easily parsable, terse output.
Each symbol name is preceded by
its value (blanks if undefined) and one of
the letters
\f4U\f1
(undefined),
\f4N\f1
(symbol has no type),
\f4D\f1
(data object symbol),
\f4T\f1
(text symbol),
\f4S\f1
(section symbol),
or
\f4F\f1
(file symbol).
If the symbol's binding attribute is \f4LOCAL\f1,
the key letter is lower case;
if the symbol's binding attribute is \f4WEAK\f1,
the key letter is upper case;
if the
\f4\-l\f1 modifier is specified, the upper case
key letter is followed by a \f4*\f1;
if the symbol's binding attribute is \f4GLOBAL\f1,
the key letter is upper case.
.PP
.TP 9
\f4\-l\f1
Distinguish between \f4WEAK\f1 and \f4GLOBAL\f1 symbols
by appending a * to the key letter for \f4WEAK\f1 symbols.
.PP
.TP 9
\f4\-V\f1
Print the version of the
\f4nm\f1 command executing
on the standard error output.
.TP 9
\f4\-T\f1
See \s-1NOTES\s0 below.
.DT
.br
.PP
Options may be used in any order, either singly or in combination,
and may appear anywhere in the command line.
When conflicting options are specified (such as
\f4nm -v -n\f1)
the first is taken and the second ignored with a
warning message to the user.

.SH NOTES
.PP
The following options are obsolete because of
changes to the object file format and will be
deleted in a future release.
.PP
.TP 9
\f4\-e\f1
Print only external and static symbols.
The symbol table now contains only static
and external symbols.
Automatic symbols no longer appear in the symbol table.
They do appear in the debugging information
produced by \f4cc \-g\f1,
which may be examined using \f4dump\f1(1).
.PP
.TP 9
\f4\-f\f1
Produce full output.
Redundant symbols (such as .text, .data, and so on) which
existed previously do not exist and producing full
output will be identical to the default output.
.PP
.TP 9
\f4\-T\f1
By default,
\f4nm\f1
prints the entire name of the symbols listed.
Since symbol names have been moved to the last column,
the problem of overflow is removed and it is no longer necessary to truncate
the symbol name.

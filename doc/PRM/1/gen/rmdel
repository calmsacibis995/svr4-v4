.SH NAME
\f4rmdel\f1 \- remove a delta from an \s-1SCCS\s+1 file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4rmdel\f1
\f4\-r\f2\s-1SID\s0\f1
.I files
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4rmdel\fP
removes the delta specified by the
.I \s-1SID\s0
(\s-1SCCS\s0 identification string)
from each named \s-1SCCS\s+1 file.
The delta to be removed must be the newest (most recent) delta
in its branch in the delta chain of each
named \s-1SCCS\s+1 file.
In addition,
the delta specified
must
not
be that of a version being edited for the purpose of
making a delta; that is, if a
p-file exists for the named \s-1SCCS\s+1 file
[see \f4get\fP(1)],
the delta specified must
not
appear in any entry of the
p-file.
.PP
The
\f4\-r\f1
option specifies the
.I \s-1SID\s0
level of the delta to be removed.
.PP
If a directory is named,
\f4rmdel\fP
behaves as though each file in the directory were
specified as a named file,
except that non-\s-1SCCS\s+1 files
(last component of the path name does not begin with \f4s.\f1)
and unreadable files are silently ignored.
If a name of \f4\-\f1 is given, the standard input is read;
each line of the standard input is taken to be the name of an \s-1SCCS\s+1 file
to be processed;
non-\s-1SCCS\s+1 files and unreadable files are silently ignored.
.PP
The rules governing the removal of a delta are as
follows: if you make a delta and have
appropriate file permissions,
you can remove it;
if you own the file and directory in which a new delta
file resides, you can remove the delta.

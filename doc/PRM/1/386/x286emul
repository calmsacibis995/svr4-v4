.SH NAME
\f4x286emul\f1 \- emulate XENIX 80286
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4x286emul
[\|\f2arg\fP\|.\|.\|.\|]
prog286
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4x286emul\f1
is an emulator that
allows programs from XENIX System\ V/286 Release\ 2.3 or
SCO's XENIX System\ V/286 Release\ 2.3.2
on the Intel 80286 to run on the Intel 80386 processor under
UNIX System\ V.
.PP
The UNIX system recognizes an attempt to
\f4exec\f1(2)
a 286 program, and
automatically
\f4exec\f1's
the 286 emulator with the 286 program name as an additional argument.
It is not necessary to specify the \f4x286emul\f1 emulator
on the command line.
The 286 programs can be invoked using the same command format as
on the XENIX System\ V/286.
.PP
\f4x286emul\f1
reads the 286 program's text and data into
memory and maps them through the
LDT
[via
\f4sysi86\f1(2)]
as 286 text and data segments.
It also fills in the jam area, which is used by XENIX programs to do system
calls and signal returns.
\f4x286emul\f1
starts the 286 program by
jumping to its entry point.
.PP
When the 286 program attempts to do a system call,
\f4x286emul\f1
takes control.
It does any conversions needed between the 286 system call and
the equivalent 386 system call, and performs the 386 system call.
The results are converted to the form the
286 program expects, and the 286 program is resumed.
.PP
The following are some of the differences between a program
running on a 286 and a 286 program using
\f4x286emul\f1
on a 386:
.IP
Attempts to unlink or write on the 286 program will
fail on the 286 with
\f4ETXTBSY\f1.
Under
\f4x286emul\f1,
they will not fail.
.IP
\f4ptrace\f1(2)
is not supported under
\f4x286emul\f1.
.IP
The 286 program must be readable for the emulator to read it.
.P
The emulator must have this name and be in
\f4/bin\f1
if it is to be automatically invoked
when
\f4exec\f1(2)
is used on a 286 program.

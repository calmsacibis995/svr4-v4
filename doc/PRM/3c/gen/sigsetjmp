.SH NAME
\f4sigsetjmp\f1, \f4siglongjmp\f1 \- a non-local goto with signal state
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\f4#include <setjmp.h>\f1
.PP
\f4int sigsetjmp (sigjmp_buf env, int savemask);\f1
.PP
\f4void siglongjmp (sigjmp_buf env, int val)\f1;
.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions are useful for dealing with errors 
and interrupts encountered in
a low-level subroutine of a program.
.PP
\f4sigsetjmp\fP saves the calling process's registers
and stack environment [see \f4sigaltstack\fP(2)] in \f2env\fP
(whose type, \f4sigjmp_buf\fP, is defined in the <\f4setjmp.h\fP> 
header file) for later use by \f4siglongjmp\fP. If \f2savemask\fP 
is non-zero, the calling process's signal mask [see \f4sigprocmask\fP(2)]
and scheduling parameters [see \f4priocntl\fP(2)] are also saved.  
\f4sigsetjmp\fP returns the value 0.
.PP
\f4siglongjmp\fP
restores the environment saved by the last call of
\f4sigsetjmp\fP
with the corresponding
\f2env\fP
argument.
After
\f4siglongjmp\fP
is completed, program execution
continues as if the corresponding call of 
\f4sigsetjmp\fP
had just returned the value
\f2val\fP.
\f4siglongjmp\fP
cannot cause
\f4sigsetjmp\fP
to return the value zero.  If
\f4siglongjmp\fP
is invoked with a second argument of zero,
\f4sigsetjmp\fP
will return 1.
At the time of the second return from
\f4sigsetjmp\fP,
all external and static variables have
values as of the time
\f4siglongjmp\fP
is called. The values of register and automatic variables are undefined.
Register or automatic variables
whose value must be relied upon
must be declared as
\f4volatile\f1.
.PP
If a signal-catching function interrupts \f(CWsleep\f1
and calls \f(CWsiglongjmp\f1 to restore an environment
saved prior to the \f(CWsleep\f1 call, the action
associated with \f(CWSIGALRM\f1 and time it is scheduled
to be generated are unspecified. It is also unspecified
whether the \f(CWSIGALRM\f1 signal is blocked, unless the
process's signal mask is restored as part of the
environment.
.P
The function \f(CWsiglongjmp\f1 restores the saved signal mask if and
only if the \f2env\f1 argument was initialized by a call to the \f(CWsigsetjmp\f1
function with a non-zero \f2savemask\f1 argument.

.SH NOTES
If
\f4siglongjmp\fP
is called even though
\f2env\fP
was never primed by a call to \%\f4sigsetjmp\fP,
or when the last such call was in a function that has since returned,
the behavior is undefined.

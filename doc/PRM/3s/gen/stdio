.SH NAME
\f4stdio\f1 \- standard buffered input/output package
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4#include <stdio.h>\f1
.PP
\f4FILE\f1
\f4\(**stdin, \(**stdout, \(**stderr;\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functions described in the entries of sub-class\ 3S of this manual constitute an efficient,
user-level
.SM I/O
buffering scheme.
The in-line macros
\f4getc\fP
and
\f4putc\fP
handle characters quickly.
The macros
\f4getchar\fP and \f4putchar\fP,
and
the higher-level routines
\f4fgetc\fP,
\f4fgets\fP,
\f4fprintf\fP,
\f4fputc\fP,
\f4fputs\fP,
\f4fread\fP,
\f4fscanf\fP,
\f4fwrite\fP,
\f4gets\fP,
\f4getw\fP,
\f4printf\fP,
\f4puts\fP,
\f4putw\fP,
and
\f4scanf\fP
all use or act as if they use
\f4getc\fP
and
\f4putc\fP;
they can be freely intermixed.
.PP
A file with associated buffering is called a
.I stream\^
[see \f4intro\fP(3)]
and is declared to be a pointer to a defined type
\f4FILE\*S\f1.
\f4fopen\fP
creates certain descriptive data for a stream
and returns a pointer to designate the stream in all
further transactions.
Normally, there are three open streams with constant
pointers declared in
the \f4<stdio.h>\fP header file and associated with the standard open files:
.RS
.PP
.PD 0
.TP 10
\f4stdin\f1
standard input file
.TP
\f4stdout\f1
standard output file
.TP
\f4stderr\f1
standard error file
.RE
.PD
.PP
The following symbolic values in \f4<unistd.h>\fP define the file descriptors
that will be associated with the C-language \f2stdin\f1, \f2stdout\f1 and
\f2stderr\f1 when the application is started:
.RS
.PP
.PD 0
.TP 17
\f4STDIN_FILENO\f1
Standard input value, \f4stdin\fP.
It has the value of 0.
.TP
\f4STDOUT_FILENO\f1
Standard output value, \f4stdout\fP.
It has the value of 1.
.TP
\f4STDERR_FILENO\f1
Standard error value, \f4stderr\fP.
It has the value of 2.
.RE
.PD
.PP
A constant 
\f4null\f1
designates a null pointer.
.PP
An integer-constant
\f4EOF\f1
(\-1) is returned
upon end-of-file or error by most integer functions that
deal with streams
(see the individual descriptions for details).
.PP
An integer constant
\f4BUFSIZ\f1
specifies the size of the buffers used by the particular implementation.
.PP
An integer constant
\f4FILENAME_MAX\f1
specifies the size needed for an array of \f4char\fP large enough to hold
the longest file name string that the implementation guarantees can be
opened.
.PP
An integer constant
\f4FOPEN_MAX\f1
specifies the minimum number of files that the implementation guarantees
can be open simultaneously.
Note that no more than 255 files
may be opened via
\f4fopen\f1, and only file descriptors 0 through 255
are valid.
.PP
Any program that uses this package
must include the header file of pertinent macro definitions,
as follows:
.PP
.RS
.ft 4
#include \|<stdio.h>
.ft 1
.RE
.PP
The functions and constants mentioned in the entries of sub-class\ 3S
of this manual
are declared in that header file
and need no further declaration.
The constants and the following ``functions'' are
implemented as macros (redeclaration of these names
is perilous):
\f4getc\fP,
\f4getchar\fP,
\f4putc\fP,
\f4putchar\fP,
\f4ferror\fP,
\f4feof\fP,
\f4clearerr\fP,
and
\f4fileno\fP.
There are also function versions of
\f4getc\fP,
\f4getchar\fP,
\f4putc\fP,
\f4putchar\fP,
\f4ferror\fP,
\f4feof\fP,
\f4clearerr\fP,
and
\f4fileno\fP.
.PP
Output streams, with the exception of the standard error stream
\f4stderr\fP,
are by default buffered if the output refers to a file
and line-buffered if the
output refers to a terminal.
The standard error output stream
\f4stderr\fP
is by default unbuffered,
but use of
\f4freopen\fP
[see
\f4fopen\fP(3S)]
will cause it to become buffered or line-buffered.
When an output stream is unbuffered,
information is queued for writing on the
destination file or terminal as soon as written;
when it is buffered,
many characters are saved up and written as a block.
When it is\p
.br
.ne 5
line-buffered,
each line of output is queued for writing on the
destination terminal as soon as the line is completed
(that is, as soon as a new-line character is written
or terminal input is requested).
\f4setbuf\fP
or
\f4setvbuf\fP [both described in
\f4setbuf\fP(3S)]
may be used to change the
stream's buffering strategy.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Invalid
.I stream\^
pointers usually cause grave disorder, possibly including
program termination.
Individual function descriptions describe the possible error conditions.

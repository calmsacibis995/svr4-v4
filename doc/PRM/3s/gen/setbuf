.SH NAME
\f4setbuf\f1, \f4setvbuf\f1 \- assign buffering to a stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4#include <stdio.h>\f1
.PP
\f4void setbuf (FILE \(**stream, char \(**buf);\f1
.PP
\f4int setvbuf (FILE \(**stream, char \(**buf, int type, size_t size);\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4setbuf\fP
may be used after a
.I stream
[see \f4intro\fP(3)] has been opened but before it
is read or written.
It causes the array pointed to by
.I buf\^
to be used instead of an automatically allocated buffer.
If
.I buf\^
is the
\f4NULL\fP
pointer input/output will be completely unbuffered.
.PP
While there is no limitation on the size of the buffer, 
the constant 
\f4BUFSIZ,\f1
defined in the
\f4stdio.h\f1
header file,
is typically a good buffer size: 
.PP
.RS
.ft 4
char buf[BUFSIZ];
.ft 1
.RE
.P
\f4setvbuf\fP
may be used after a stream has been opened 
but before it is read or written.
.I type\^
determines how 
.I stream\^
will be buffered.
Valid values for 
.I type\^
(defined in \f4stdio.h\fP) are:
.TP 12
\f4_IOFBF\fP
causes input/output to be fully buffered.
.TP
\f4_IOLBF\fP
causes output to be line buffered; 
the buffer is flushed when a newline
is written, the buffer is full, or input is requested.
.TP
\f4_IONBF\fP
causes input/output to be completely unbuffered.
.P
If
.I buf\^
is not the 
\f4NULL\f1
pointer, the array it points to
is used for buffering, instead of an automatically allocated
buffer.
.I size\^
specifies the size of the buffer to be used.
If input/output is unbuffered, 
.I buf
and 
.I size
are ignored.
.P
For a further discussion of buffering,
see \f4stdio\f1(3S).

.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
If an invalid value for 
.I type\^
is provided,
\f4setvbuf\fP
returns a non-zero value.  
Otherwise, it returns zero.
.SH NOTES
A common source of error is allocating buffer space
as an ``automatic'' variable in a code block, and then
failing to close the stream in the same block.
.PP
Parts of \f4buf\f1 are used for internal bookkeeping
of the stream and, therefore, \f4buf\f1 contains
less than \f2size\f1 bytes when full.
It is recommended that the automatically allocated buffer
is used when using 
\f4setvbuf\f1.

.SH NAME
\f4putc\f1, \f4putchar\f1, \f4fputc\f1, \f4putw\f1 \- put character or word on a stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4#include <stdio.h>\f1
.PP
\f4int putc (int c, FILE \(**stream);\f1
.PP
\f4int putchar (int c);\f1
.PP
\f4int fputc (int c, FILE \(**stream);\f1
.PP
\f4int putw (int w, FILE\*S \(**stream);\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4putc\fP
writes \f2c\fP
(converted to an \f4unsigned char\fP)
onto the output
.I stream\^
[see \f4intro\fP(3)]
at the position where the file pointer (if defined)
is pointing, and advances the file pointer appropriately.
If the file cannot support positioning requests, or \f2stream\fP
was opened with append mode, the character is appended to the
output \f2stream\fP.
\f4putchar(c)\fP
is defined as
\f4putc(c, stdout)\fP.
\f4putc\fP
and
\f4putchar\fP
are macros.
.PP
\f4fputc\fP
behaves like
\f4putc\fP,
but is a function rather than a macro.
\f4fputc\fP
runs more slowly than
\f4putc\fP,
but it takes less space per invocation and its name can be
passed as an argument to a function.
.PP
\f4putw\fP
writes the word (i.e., integer)
.I w\^
to the output
.I stream\^
(where the file pointer, if defined, is pointing).
The size of a word is the size of an integer and
varies from machine to machine.
\f4putw\fP
neither assumes nor causes special alignment in the file.
.SH SEE ALSO
\f4exit\fP(2),
\f4lseek\fP(2),
\f4write\fP(2),
\f4abort\fP(3C),
\f4fclose\fP(3S),
\f4ferror\fP(3S),
\f4fopen\fP(3S),
\f4fread\fP(3S),
\f4printf\fP(3S),
\f4puts\fP(3S),
\f4setbuf\fP(3S), \f4stdio\fP(3S).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
On success, these functions (with the exception of \f4putw\fP)
each return the value they have written.
\f4putw\fP returns \f4ferror (\f2stream\f4)\f1.
On failure, they return the constant
\f4EOF\f1.
This result will occur, for example, if the file
.I stream\^
is not open for writing
or if the output file cannot grow.
.SH NOTES
Because it is implemented as a macro,
\f4putc\fP
evaluates a
.I stream\^
argument more than once.
In particular,
\f4putc(c, \(**f++);\f1
doesn't work sensibly.
\f4fputc\fP
should be used instead.
.P
Because of possible differences in word length and byte ordering,
files written using
\f4putw\fP
are machine-dependent,
and may not be read using
\f4getw\fP
on a different processor.
.PP
Functions exist for all the above defined macros.
To get the function form, the macro name
must be undefined
(e.g., \f4#undef putc\f1).

.SH NAME
\f4fread\f1, \f4fwrite\f1 \- binary input/output
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\f4#include <stdio.h>\f1
.PP
\f4size_t fread (void \(**ptr, size_t size, size_t nitems, FILE \(**stream);\f1
.PP
\f4size_t fwrite (const void \(**ptr, size_t size, size_t nitems, FILE
    \(**stream);\f1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4fread\f1 reads into an array pointed to by \f2ptr\f1 up
to \f2nitems\f1 items of data from \f2stream\f1, where an item
of data is a sequence of bytes (not necessarily terminated by a null byte) of
length \f2size\f1.
\f4fread\f1 stops reading bytes if an end-of-file or error
condition is encountered while reading \f2stream\f1,
or if \f2nitems\f1 items
have been read.
\f4fread\f1 increments the data pointer
in \f2stream\f1 to point
to the byte following the last byte read if there is one.
\f4fread\f1 does not change the contents of \f2stream\f1.
\f4fread\f1 returns the number of items read.
.P
\f4fwrite\f1 writes to the named output \f2stream\f1 at most
\f2nitems\f1 items of data from the array pointed to by \f2ptr\f1, where an item
of data is a sequence of bytes (not necessarily terminated by a null byte) of
length \f2size\f1.
\f4fwrite\f1 stops writing when it has written \f2nitems\f1
items of data or if an error condition is encountered on \f2stream\f1.
\f4fwrite\f1 does not change the contents of the array pointed
to by \f2ptr\f1.
\f4fwrite\f1 increments the data-pointer in
\f2stream\f1 by the
number of bytes written.
\f4fwrite\f1 returns the number of items written.
.P
If \f2size\f1 or \f2nitems\f1 is zero, then \f4fread\fP and \f4fwrite\f1
return a value of 0 and do not effect the state of \f2stream\f1.
.P
The \f4ferror\f1 or \f4feof\f1 routines must be used to distinguish between an
error condition and end-of-file condition.

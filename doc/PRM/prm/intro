.BK "Programmer\'s Reference Manual"
.CH "Introduction"
.H 1 "Introduction"
This manual describes the programming
features of the \s-1UNIX\s+1 system.
It contains individual manual pages that describe
commands, system calls, subroutines, file formats,
and other useful topics, such as the ASCII table shown on \f4ascii\f1(5).
It provides neither a general
overview of the \s-1UNIX\s+1 system
nor details of the implementation of the system.
.P
Not all commands, features, and facilities described in this manual
are available in every \s-1UNIX\s+1 system. 
Some of the features require additional utilities that may not exist on
your system.
.P
The manual is divided into
five sections:
.sp1
.nf
.ta 2m +\w'\1.~~'u +\w'1M.~~'u
	1.	Commands
	2.	System Calls
	3.	Subroutines:
		3C.	C Programming Language Library Routines
		3S.	Standard I/O Library Routines
		3E.	Executable and Linking Format Library Routines
		3G.	General Purpose Library Routines
		3M.	Math Library Routines
		3X.	Specialized Library Routines
	4.	File Formats
	5.	Miscellaneous Facilities

.P
\f3Section~1\fP (\f2Commands\^\fP)
describes commands that support C and other programming languages.
.P
\f3Section~2\fP (\f2System Calls\^\fP)
describes the access to the services provided by 
the \s-1UNIX\s+1 system kernel, including the C language
interface.
.P
\f3Section~3\fP (\f2Subroutines\^\fP) describes the available
general subroutines.
In many cases, several related subroutines are described
on the same manual page.
Their binary versions reside in various system libraries.
See \f4intro\^\fP(3) for descriptions of these libraries and the
files in which they are stored.
.P
\f3Section~4\fP
(\f2File Formats\^\fP)
documents the structure of particular
kinds of files;
for example, the format of the output of the link editor is given
in \f4a.out\^\fP(4).
Excluded are files used by only one command
(for example, the assembler's intermediate files, if any).
In general, the C language structures
corresponding to these formats
can be found in the directories \f4/usr/include\fP
and \f4/usr/include/sys\fP.
.P
\f3Section~5\fP (\f2Miscellaneous Facilities\^\fP) contains a variety of things.
Included are descriptions of character sets, macro
packages, etc.
.P
References with numbers other than those above mean that the utility
is contained in the appropriate section of another manual.
References with \^(1)\^
following the command mean that the utility is contained in 
this manual or the \f2User's Reference Manual\f1.
In these cases,
the \f3\s-1SEE ALSO\fP\s+1 section of the entry in which
the reference appears will point you to the correct book.
.P
Each section consists of a number of independent
entries of a page or so each.
Entries within each section are
alphabetized,
with the exception of the introductory entry
that begins each section. 
Some entries may describe several routines, commands, etc.
In such cases, the entry appears only once, alphabetized under
its ``primary'' name, the name that appears at the upper corners of
each manual page.
Subsections 3C and 3S are grouped together
because their functions constitute
the standard C library.
.P
All entries are based on a common format,
not all of whose parts always appear:
.BL
.LI
The
\f3\s-1NAME\s+1\fP
part gives the name(s) of the entry and
briefly
states its purpose.
.LI
The
\f3\s-1SYNOPSIS\s+1\fP
part summarizes the use of the
program or function being described.
A few conventions are used, particularly in
Section~2
(\f2System Calls\^\fP):
.BL
.LI
\f4Constant width typeface\fP
strings are literals and
are to be typed just as they appear.
.LI
\f2Italic\^\fP strings usually represent
substitutable argument prototypes
and program names found elsewhere in the manual.
.LI
Square brackets [\|] around an argument prototype
indicate that the argument is optional.
When an argument prototype is given as
\f2name\f1 or \f2file\f1\^,
it always
refers to a
file
name.
.LI
Ellipses \^.\|.\|.\^ are used to show that the previous argument prototype
may be repeated.
.LI
A final convention is used by the commands themselves.
An argument beginning with a minus \|\f3\(mi\fP\| or
plus \|\f3\(pl\fP\| sign
is often taken to be some sort of flag argument,
even if it appears in a position where a file name
could appear.
Therefore, it is unwise to have files
whose names begin with \|\f3\(mi\fP\| or
\|\f3\(pl\fP\|.
.LE
.LI
The
\f3\s-1DESCRIPTION\s+1\fP
part describes the utility.
.LI
The
\f3\s-1EXAMPLE(S)\s+1\fP
part gives
example(s) of usage, where appropriate.
.LI
The
\f3\s-1FILES\s+1\fP
part gives the file names that are
built into the program.
.LI
The
\f3\s-1SEE ALSO\s+1\fP
part gives pointers to related information.
.LI
The
\f3\s-1DIAGNOSTICS\s+1\fP
part discusses
the diagnostic indications that may be produced.
Messages that are intended to be self-explanatory
are not listed.
.LI
The
\f3\s-1NOTES\s+1\fP
part gives generally helpful hints
about the use of the utility.
.LE
.P
A ``Table of Contents'' and a ``Permuted Index''
derived from that table precede
Section 1.
The ``Permuted Index'' is a list of keywords, given in the second
of three columns, together with the context in which each keyword is found.
Keywords are either topical keywords or the names of manual entries.
Entries are identified with their section numbers shown in parentheses.
This is important because there is considerable duplication of names
among the sections, arising principally from commands
and functions that exist
only to exercise a particular system call.
The right column lists the name of the manual page on which each
keyword may be found.
The left column contains useful information about the keyword.

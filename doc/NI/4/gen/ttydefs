.SH NAME
ttydefs \- file contains terminal line settings information for \f4ttymon\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4/etc/ttydefs\f1 is an administrative file that contains information
used by \f4ttymon\f1 to
set up the speed and terminal settings for a TTY port.
.P
The \f4ttydefs\f1 file contains the following fields:
.TP 15
\f2ttylabel\f1
The string \f4ttymon\f1 tries to match against the
TTY port's \f2ttylabel\f1 field in the port monitor administrative file.
It often describes the speed at which the
terminal is supposed to run, for example, \f41200\f1.
.TP
\f2initial-flags\f1
Contains the initial \f4termio\fP(7) settings to which the
terminal is to be set.
For example, the system administrator will be able to specify what the
default erase and kill characters will be.
\f2initial-flags\f1 must be specified in the syntax recognized by the
\f4stty\f1 command.
.TP
\f2final-flags\f1
\f2final-flags\f1 must be specified in the same format as
\f2initial-flags\f1.
\f4ttymon\f1
sets these final settings after a connection request has
been made and immediately prior to invoking a port's service.
.TP
\f2autobaud\f1
If the autobaud field contains the character `A', autobaud will be enabled.
Otherwise, autobaud will be disabled.
\f4ttymon\fP
determines what line speed to set the TTY port to by analyzing the
carriage returns entered.
If autobaud has been disabled, the hunt sequence is used for baud
rate determination.
.TP
\f2nextlabel\f1
If the user indicates that the current terminal setting is not
appropriate by sending a BREAK, \f4ttymon\f1 searchs for
a \f4ttydefs\f1 entry whose \f2ttylabel\f1 field matches 
the \f2nextlabel\f1 field.
If a match is found,
\f4ttymon\f1 uses that field as its \f2ttylabel\f1 field.
A series of speeds is often linked together in this way into a
closed set called a hunt sequence.
For example, \f44800\f1 may be linked to \f41200\f1,
which in turn is linked to \f42400\f1, which is finally linked to
\f44800\f1.

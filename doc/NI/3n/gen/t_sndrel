.SH NAME
\f4t_sndrel\f1 \- initiate an orderly release
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4#include <tiuser.h>\f1
.PP
\f4int t_sndrel (int fd);\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function is used to initiate an orderly release of a transport connection
and indicates to the transport provider that
the transport user has no more data to send.
\f4fd\fP identifies the local transport endpoint where the connection exists.
After issuing
\f4t_sndrel\fP,
the user may not send any more data over the connection.
However, a user may continue to receive data if an
orderly release indication has not been received.
.PP
This function is an optional service of the transport provider,
and is only supported if the transport provider returned service
type \f4T_COTS_ORD\fP on \f4t_open\fP or \f4t_getinfo\fP.
.P
If \f4t_sndrel\fP is issued from an invalid state, the provider
will generate an \f4EPROTO\fP protocol error; however, this
error may not occur until a subsequent reference to the transport
endpoint.
.P
On failure, \f4t_errno\f1 may be set to one of the following:
.TP 20
\f4TBADF\fP
The specified file descriptor does not refer to a transport endpoint.
.TP
\f4TFLOW\fP
\f4O_NDELAY\fP or \f4O_NONBLOCK\fP was set, but the flow control
mechanism prevented the transport provider from accepting the
function at this time.
.TP
\f4TNOTSUPPORT\fP
This function is not supported by the underlying transport
provider.
.TP
\f4TSYSERR\fP
A system error has occurred during execution of this function.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
\f4t_sndrel\fP returns 0 on success and \-1 on failure and
\f4t_errno\f1 is set to indicate the error.

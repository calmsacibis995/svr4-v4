.SH NAME
\f4rpcbind\f1 \- universal addresses to RPC program number mapper
.SH SYNOPSIS
.ft 4
rpcbind
.ft 1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4rpcbind\f1
is a server that converts RPC
program numbers into
universal addresses.
It must be running to make RPC calls.
.P
When an RPC service is started,
it will tell
\f4rpcbind\f1
at what address it is listening,
and what RPC
program numbers it is prepared to serve.
When a client wishes to make an RPC
call to a given program number,
it will first contact
\f4rpcbind\f1
on the server machine to determine
the address where RPC
packets should be sent.
.P
Normally, standard RPC
servers are started by
port monitors,
so
\f4rpcbind\f1
must be started before
port monitors are invoked.
.P
\f4rpcbind\f1 is restricted to users with appropriate privileges.
.SH NOTES
If
\f4rpcbind\f1
crashes, all RPC servers must be restarted.

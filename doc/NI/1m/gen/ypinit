.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\f4ypinit\f1
sets up a
\s-1YP\s0
name service database on a
\s-1YP\s0
server.
It can be used to set up a master or a slave server,
or a client system.
You must be the privileged user to run it.
It asks a few self-explanatory  questions,
and reports success or failure to the terminal.
.P
It sets up a master server
using the simple model in which that server
is master to all maps in the data base.
This is the way to bootstrap the
\s-1YP\s0
system;
later if you want you can change the association of maps to masters.
.P
All databases are built from scratch,
either from information available to the program at runtime,
or from the
\s-1ASCII\s0
data base files in
\f4/etc\f1.
These files should be in their \(lqtraditional\(rq form,
rather than the abbreviated form used on client machines.
.P
A
\s-1YP\s0
database on a slave server is set up by copying
an existing database from a running server. 
The
\f2master-name\f1
argument should be the hostname of a
\s-1YP\s0
server (either the master server for all the maps,
or a server on which the data base is up-to-date and stable).
.P
To set up a client,
\f4ypinit\f1
prompts for a list of
\s-1YP\s0
servers to bind the client to,
this list should be ordered from closest to
farthest server.
.P
Read
\f4ypfiles\f1(4)
and
\f4ypserv\f1(1M)
for an overview of the 
\s-1YP\s0
name service.
.P
The following options are available:
.TP 16
\f4\-c\f1
Set up a client system.
.TP
\f4\-m\f1
Indicate that the local host is to be the
\s-1YP\s0
master.
.TP
\f4\-s \f2master-name\f1
Set up a slave database.

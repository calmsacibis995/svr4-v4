.SH NAME
\f4ypxfr\fP \- transfer YP map from a YP server to host
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
The
\f4ypxfr\f1
command moves a
\s-1YP\s0
map in the default domain for the local host
to the local host by making use of normal
\s-1YP\s0
services.
It creates a temporary map in the directory
\f4/var/yp/\f2ypdomain\f1
(this directory must already exist;
\f2ypdomain\f1
is the default domain for the local host),
fills it by enumerating the map's entries,
fetches the map parameters (master and order number),
and loads them.
It then deletes any old versions of the map and moves the
temporary map to the real
\f2mapname\f1.
.P
If run interactively,
\f4ypxfr\f1
writes its output to the terminal.
However, if it is started without a controlling terminal,
and if the log file
\f4/var/yp/ypxfr.log\f1
exists, it appends all its output to that file. 
Since
\f4ypxfr\f1
is most often run from the privileged user's
\f4crontab\f1
file, or by
\f4ypserv\f1,
the log file can be used to retain a record
of what was attempted, and what the results were.
.P
For consistency between servers,
\f4ypxfr\f1
should be run periodically for every map in the
\s-1YP\s0
data base.
Different maps change
at different rates: a
map may not change for months at a time,
for instance, and may
therefore be checked only once a day.
Some maps may change several times per day.
In such a case, you may want to check hourly
for updates.
A
\f4crontab\f1(1)
entry can be used to perform periodic updates automatically.
Rather than having a separate
\f4crontab\f1
entry for each map,
you can group commands to update several maps in a shell script.
Examples (mnemonically named) are in
\f4/usr/sbin/yp\f1:
\f4ypxfr_1perday\f1,
and
\f4ypxfr_1perhour\f1.
They can serve as reasonable first cuts.
.P
Refer to
\f4ypfiles\f1(4)
and
\f4ypserv\f1(1M)
for an overview of the YP
name service.
.P
The following options are available:
.TP 16
\f4\-c\f1
Do not send a \(lqClear current map\(rq request to the local
\f4ypserv\f1
process. 
Use this flag if
\f4ypserv\f1
is not running locally at the time you are running
\f4ypxfr\f1.
Otherwise,
\f4ypxfr\f1
complains that it cannot talk to the local
\f4ypserv\f1,
and the transfer fails.
.TP
\f4\-f\f1
Force the transfer to occur even if the version at the master is not
more recent than the local version.
.TP
\f4\-C \f2tid prog server\f1
This option is
\f2only\f1
for use by
\f4ypserv\f1.
When
\f4ypserv\f1
starts
\f4ypxfr\f1,
it specifies that
\f4ypxfr\f1
should call back a
\f4yppush\f1
process at the host
\f2server\f1,
registered as program number
\f2prog\f1,
and waiting for a response to transaction
\f2tid\f1.
.TP
\f4\-d \f2ypdomain\f1
Specify a domain other than the default domain.
.TP
\f4\-h \f2host\f1
Get the map from
\f2host\f1,
regardless of what the map says the master is. 
If
\f2host\f1
is not specified,
\f4ypxfr\f1
asks the
\s-1YP\s0
service for the name of the master, and try to get the
map from there.
\f2host\f1
must be a name.
.TP
\f4\-s \f2ypdomain\f1
Specify a source domain from which to
transfer a map that should be the same
across domains.

.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4pmadm\f1 is the administrative command for the lower level
of the Service Access Facility hierarchy, that is, for service
administration.
A port may have only one service associated with it
although the same service may be available through more than one port.
In order to uniquely identify an instance of a service the
\f4pmadm\f1 command must
identify both the port monitor or port monitors through which the
service is available (\f4\-p\f1 or \f4\-t\f1) and the service
(\f4\-s\f1).
See the option descriptions
below.
.P
\f4pmadm\f1 performs the following functions:
.sp .5
.in +.5i
.nf
\- add or remove a service
.sp .25
\- enable or disable a service
.sp .25
\- install or replace a per-service configuration script
.sp .25
\- print requested service information
.fi
.in -.5i
.sp .5
Any user on the system may invoke \f4pmadm\f1 to request
service status (\f4\-l\f1 or \f4\-L\f1) or to print 
per-service configuration scripts
(\f4\-g\f1 without the \f4\-z\f1 option).
\f4pmadm\f1 with other options
may be executed only by a privileged user.
.P
The options have the following meanings:
.TP .5i
\f4\-a\f1
Add a service.
\f4pmadm\f1 adds 
an entry for the new service 
to
the port monitor's administrative file.
Because of the complexity of the options and arguments that follow
the \f4\-a\f1 option,
it may be convenient to use a command script or the menu system
to add
services.
If you use the menu system, enter \f4sysadm ports\f1, then
choose the \f4port_services\f1 option.
.TP
\f4\-d\f1
Disable a service.
Add \f4x\f1 to the flag field in the entry for the service
\f2svctag\f1 in the port monitor's administrative file.
This is the entry used by port monitor \f2pmtag\f1.
See the \f4\-f\f1 option, below, for a description of the flags
available.
.TP
\f4\-e\f1
Enable a service.
Remove \f4x\f1 from the flag field in the entry for the service
\f2svctag\f1 in the port monitor administrative file.
This is the entry used by port monitor \f2pmtag\f1.
See the \f4\-f\f1 option, below, for a description of the flags
available.
.TP
\f4\-f\f1 \f4xu\f1
The \f4\-f\f1 option
specifies one or both of the following two flags which are then
included in the flag
field of the entry for the new service in the port monitor's
administrative file.
If the \f4\-f\f1 option is not included, no flags are set
and the default conditions prevail.
By default, a new service is enabled and no \f4utmp\f1 entry
is created for it.
A \f4\-f\f1 option without a following argument is illegal.
.sp .5
.in +.25i
\f4x\f1\0\0\0Do not enable the service \f2svctag\f1 available through
.br
\0\0\0\0port monitor \f2pmtag\f1.
.sp .5
\f4u\f1\0\0\0Create a \f4utmp\f1 entry for service \f2svctag\f1 available through
.br
\0\0\0\0port monitor \f2pmtag\f1.
.in -.25i
.TP
\f4\-g\f1
Print, install, or replace a per-service 
configuration script.
The \f4\-g\f1 option with
a \f4\-p\f1 option and a \f4\-s\f1 option
prints the per-service configuration script
for service \f2svctag\f1 available
through port monitor \f2pmtag\f1.
The \f4\-g\f1 option with
a \f4\-p\f1 option, a \f4\-s\f1 option, and a
\f4\-z\f1 option installs the per-service configuration
script contained in the file \f2script\fP
as the per-service
configuration script for service \f2svctag\f1 available through
port monitor \f2pmtag\f1.
The \f4\-g\f1 option
with a \f4\-s\f1 option, a \f4\-t\f1 option, and a
\f4\-z\f1 option installs
the file \f2script\fP as the per-service
configuration script for service
\f2svctag\f1 available through any port monitor of type \f2type\f1.
Other combinations of options with \f4\-g\f1 are invalid.
.TP
\f4\-i\f1 \f4id\fP
\f4id\fP is the identity that is to be assigned to service
\f2svctag\f1 when it is started.
\f4id\fP must be an entry in \f4/etc/passwd\f1.
.TP
\f4\-l\f1
The \f4\-l\f1 option requests service information.
Used by itself and with the options described below it 
provides a filter for extracting information in several
different groupings.
.RS
.TP .8i
\f4\-l\f1
By itself, the \f4\-l\f1 option lists all services on the system.
.TP
\f4\-l\f1 \f4\-p\f1 \f2pmtag\f1
Lists all services available through port monitor \f2pmtag\f1.
.TP
\f4\-l\f1 \f4\-s\f1 \f2svctag\f1
Lists all services with tag \f2svctag\f1.
.TP
\f4\-l\f1 \f4\-p\f1 \f2pmtag\f1 \f4\-s\f1 \f2svctag\f1
Lists service \f2svctag\f1.
.TP
\f4\-l\f1 \f4\-t\f1 \f2type\f1
Lists all services available through port monitors of type \f2type\f1.
.TP
\f4\-l\f1 \f4\-t\f1 \f2type\f1 \f4\-s\f1 \f2svctag\f1
Lists all services
with tag \f2svctag\f1
available through a port monitor of
type \f2type\f1.
.TP
Other combinations of options with \f4\-l\f1 are invalid.
.RE
.TP .5i
\f4\-L\f1
The \f4\-L\f1 option is identical to the \f4\-l\f1
option except
that output is printed in a condensed format.
.TP
\f4\-m\f1 \f2pmspecific\f1
\f2pmspecific\f1 is the port monitor-specific portion of the
port monitor administrative file entry for the service.
.TP
\f4\-p\f1 \f2pmtag\f1
Specifies the tag associated with the port monitor
through which a service (specified as \f4\-s \f2svctag\f1)
is available.
.TP
\f4\-r\f1
Remove a service.
When \f4pmadm\f1 removes a service, 
the entry for the service is removed
from the port monitor's administrative file.
.TP
\f4\-s\f1 \f2svctag\f1
Specifies the service tag associated with a given service.
The service tag is assigned by the system administrator
and is part of the entry for the service in the port monitor's
administrative file.
.TP
\f4\-t\f1 \f2type\f1
Specifies the the port monitor type.
.TP
\f4\-v\f1 \f2ver\f1
Specifies the version number of the port monitor
administrative file.
The version number may be given as
.in +.5i
.sp .5
.nf
\f4\-v \`pmspec \-V\`\f1
.fi
.sp .5
.in -.5i
where \f2pmspec\f1 is the special administrative command
for port monitor \f2pmtag\f1.
This special command is \f4ttyadm\f1 for \f4ttymon\f1 and
\f4nlsadmin\f1 for \f4listen\f1.
The version stamp of the port monitor is known by
the command and is returned
when \f2pmspec\f1 is invoked with a \f4\-V\f1 option.
.TP
\f4\-y\f1 \f2comment\f1
Associate \f2comment\f1 with the
service
entry in the port monitor administrative file.
.TP
\f4\-z\f1 \f2script\fP
.br
Used with the \f4\-g\f1 option to specify the name
of the file that contains
the per-service configuration script.
Modifying a configuration script is a three-step procedure.
First a copy of the existing script is made (\f4\-g\f1 alone).
Then the copy is edited.
Finally, the copy is put in place over the existing script
(\f4\-g\f1 with \f4\-z\f1).
.SH OUTPUT
If successful, \f4pmadm\f1 will exit with a status of \f40\f1.
If it fails for any reason, it will exit with a nonzero status.
.P
Options that request information write the requested information
to the standard output.
A request for information using the \f4\-l\f1 option prints
column headers and
aligns the information under the appropriate
headings.
In this format, a missing field is indicated by a hyphen.
A request for information in the 
condensed format
using the \f4\-L\f1 option
prints the information in colon-separated fields;
missing fields are indicated by two successive colons.
\f4#\f1 is the comment
character.
.SH EXAMPLES
Add a service to a port monitor with tag \f4pmtag\f1.
Give the service the tag \f4svctag\f1.
Port
monitor-specific information is generated by \f4specpm\f1.
The service defined by \f4svctag\fP will be invoked with identity \f4root\fP.

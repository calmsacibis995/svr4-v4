.SH NAME
\f4keyserv\f1 \- server for storing public and private keys
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4keyserv \f1[\f4\-n\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX "keyenvoy server" "" "\fLkeyenvoy\fP server"
\f4keyserv\f1
is a daemon that is used for storing the
private encryption keys of each
user logged into the system.
These encryption
keys are used for accessing
secure network services such as secure NFS.
.P
Normally, root's key is read from the file
\f4/etc/.rootkey\f1
when the daemon is started.
This is useful during power-fail reboots
when no one is around to type a password.
.P
When the
\f4\-n\f1
option is used,
root's key is not read from
\f4/etc/.rootkey\f1.
Instead,
\f4keyserv\fP
prompts the user for the password to decrypt
root's key stored in the \f4publickey\fP(4) database
and then stores the decrypted key in
\f4/etc/.rootkey\f1
for future use.
This option is useful if the
\f4/etc/.rootkey\f1
file ever gets out of date or corrupted.
.PP
To start \f4keyserv\fP manually, you must be \f4root\fP with the appropriate
privileges.

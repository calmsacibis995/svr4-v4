.SH NAME
\f4sockio\fP \- ioctls that operate directly on sockets
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\f4#include <sys/sockio.h>\fP
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX "socket I/O, see \fLsockio\fP(7)"
.IX I/O "socket, see \fLsockio\fP(7)"
.LP
The
.SM IOCTL\s0's
listed in this manual page apply directly to sockets, independent of any
underlying protocol.
The
\f4setsockopt\fP
call (see
\f4getsockopt\fP(3N))
is the primary method for operating on sockets, rather
than on the underlying protocol or network interface.
\f4ioctl\fPs
for a specific network interface or protocol are documented in the
manual page for that interface or protocol.
.TP 20
\s-1SIOCSPGRP\s+1
The argument is a pointer to an
\f4int\fP.
Set the process-group ID that will subsequently receive
\f4SIGIO\fP
or
\f4SIGURG\fP
signals for the socket referred to by the descriptor passed to
\f4ioctl\fP
to the value of that
\f4int\fP.
.TP 20
\f4SIOCGPGRP\fP
The argument is a pointer to an
\f4int\fP.
Set the value of that
\f4int\fP
to the process-group
.SM ID
that is receiving
\f4SIGIO\fP
or
\f4SIGURG\fP
signals for the socket referred to by the descriptor passed to
\f4ioctl\fP.
.TP 20
\f4SIOCCATMARK\fP
The argument is a pointer to an
\f4int\fP.
Set the value of that
\f4int\fP
to 1 if the read pointer for the socket referred to by the descriptor passed
to
\f4ioctl\fP
points to a mark in the data stream for an out-of-band message.
Set the value of that \f3int\fP to 0 if the read pointer for the socket
referred to by the descriptor passed to \f3ioctl\fP 
does not point to a mark in the data stream for an 
out-of-band message.

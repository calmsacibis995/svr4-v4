.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.SM IP
is the internetwork datagram delivery protocol that is central
to the Internet protocol family.
Programs may use
.SM IP
through higher-level protocols
such as the Transmission Control Protocol (\s-1TCP\s0) or the User Datagram
Protocol (\s-1UDP\s0),
or may interface directly to IP.
See
\f4tcp\f1(7)
and
\f4udp\f1(7).
Direct access may be via the socket interface
(using a \(lqraw socket\(rq) or
the Transport Level Interface
(\s-1TLI\s0).
The protocol options defined in the
.SM IP
specification may be set
in outgoing datagrams.
.LP
The
.SM STREAMS
driver
\f4/dev/rawip\f1
is the
.SM TLI
transport provider that provides
raw access to
.SM IP\s0.
The device
\f4/dev/ip\f1
is the multiplexing
.SM STREAMS
driver that implements
the protocol processing of
.SM IP\s0.
The latter connects below to datalink providers [interface drivers, see 
\f4if\f1(3N)],
and above to transport providers such as
.SM TCP
and
.SM UDP\s0.
.LP
Raw
.SM IP
sockets are connectionless and are normally used
with the
\f4sendto(\|)\f1
and
\f4recvfrom(\|)\f1
calls,
[(see
\f4send\f1(2)
and
\f4recv\f1(2)]
although the
\f4connect\f1(2)
call may also be used to fix the destination for future datagrams
[in which case the
\f4read\f1(2)
or
\f4recv\f1(2)
and
\f4write\f1(2)
or
\f4send\f1(2)
calls may be used].
If
\f4proto\f1
is zero, the default protocol,
\f4IPPROTO_RAW\f1,
is used.  If
\f4proto\f1
is non-zero, that protocol number will be set in outgoing datagrams
and will be used to filter incoming datagrams.
An
.SM IP
header will be generated and prepended to each outgoing datagram;
received datagrams are returned with the
.SM IP
header and options intact.
.LP
A single socket option,
\f4IP_OPTIONS\f1,
is supported at the
.SM IP
level.  This socket option may be used to set
.SM IP
options to be included in each outgoing datagram.
.SM IP
options to be sent are set with
\f4setsockopt(\|)\f1
[see
\f4getsockopt\f1(2)].
The
\f4getsockopt\f1(2)
call returns the
.SM IP
options set in the last
\f4setsockopt(\|)\f1
call.
.SM IP
options on received datagrams are visible to user programs only
using raw
.SM IP
sockets.  The format of
.SM IP
options given in
\f4setsockopt(\|)\f1
matches those defined in the
.SM IP
specification with one exception:
the list of addresses for the source routing options
must include the first-hop gateway at the beginning of the
list of gateways.
The first-hop gateway address will be extracted from the option
list and the size adjusted accordingly before use.
.SM IP
options may be used with any socket type in the Internet family.
.LP
At the socket level, the socket option
\f4SO_DONTROUTE\f1
may be applied.
This option forces datagrams being sent to bypass the routing step
in output.
Normally,
.SM IP
selects a network interface to send the datagram,
and possibly an intermediate gateway,
based on an entry in the routing table.
See
\f4routing\f1(4).
When
.SM
\f4SO_DONTROUTE\f1
is set, the datagram will be sent using the interface
whose network number or full
.SM IP
address matches the destination address.
If no interface matches, the error
\f4ENETUNRCH\fP
will be returned.
.LP
Raw
.SM IP
datagrams can also be sent and received 
using the
.SM TLI
connectionless primitives.
.LP
Datagrams flow through the
.SM IP
layer in two directions:
from the network 
.I up
to user processes and from user
processes
.I down
to the network.
Using this orientation,
.SM IP
is layered
.I above
the network interface drivers and
.I below
the transport protocols such as
.SM UDP
and
.SM TCP\s0.
The Internet Control Message Protocol (\s-1ICMP\s0) is logically
a part of
.SM IP\s0.  See
\f4icmp\f1(7).
.LP
IP provides for a checksum of the header part, but not the data
part of the datagram.
The checksum value is computed and set in the process of sending
datagrams and checked when receiving datagrams.
.SM IP
header checksumming may be disabled for debugging purposes
by patching the kernel variable
\f4ipcksum\f1
to have the value
zero.
.LP
.SM IP
options in received datagrams are processed in the
.SM IP
layer
according to the protocol specification.
Currently recognized
.SM IP
options include:
security,
loose source and record route (\s-1LSRR\s0),
strict source and record route (\s-1SSRR\s0),
record route,
stream identifier, and
internet timestamp.
.LP
The
.SM IP
layer will normally forward received datagrams that are not addressed
to it.
Forwarding is under the control of the kernel variable
.IR ipforwarding :
if
.I ipforwarding
is zero,
.SM IP
datagrams will not be forwarded;  if
.I ipforwarding
is one,
.SM IP
datagrams will be forwarded.
.I ipforwarding
is usually set to one only in machines with more than one
network interface (internetwork routers).
This kernel variable can be patched to enable or disable forwarding.
.LP
The
.SM IP
layer will send an
.SM ICMP
message back to the source host in many
cases when it receives a datagram that can not be handled.
A \(lqtime exceeded\(rq
.SM ICMP
message will be sent if the \(lqtime to live\(rq
field in the
.SM IP
header drops to zero in the process of forwarding a datagram.
A \(lqdestination unreachable\(rq message will be sent if a datagram can not
be forwarded because there is no route to the final destination,
or if it can not be fragmented.
If the datagram is addressed to the local host
but is destined for a protocol that is not supported or a port
that is not in use,
a destination unreachable message will also be sent.
The
.SM IP
layer may send an
.SM ICMP
\(lqsource quench\(rq message if it is
receiving datagrams too quickly.
.SM ICMP
messages are only sent for the first fragment of a fragmented
datagram and are never returned in response to errors in other
.SM ICMP
messages.
.LP
The
.SM IP
layer supports fragmentation and reassembly.
Datagrams are fragmented on output if the datagram is larger than the
maximum transmission unit (\s-1MTU\s0) of the network interface.
Fragments of received datagrams are dropped from the reassembly queues
if the complete datagram is not reconstructed within a short time period.
.LP
Errors in sending discovered at the network interface driver layer
are passed by
.SM IP
back up to the user process.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
A socket operation may fail with one of the following errors returned:
.TP 20
\f4EACCESS\f1
A 
.SM IP
broadcast destination address was specified 
and the caller was not the privileged user.
.TP
\f4EISCONN\f1
An attempt was made to establish a connection on a socket which
already had one, or to send a datagram with the destination
address specified and the socket was already connected.
.TP
\f4EMSGSIZE\f1
An attempt was made to send a datagram that was
too large for an interface,
but was not allowed to be fragmented (such as broadcasts).
.TP
\f4ENETUNREACH\f1
An attempt was made to establish a connection or send a datagram,
where there was no matching entry in the routing table,
or if an
.SM ICMP
\(lqdestination unreachable\(rq message was received.
.TP
\f4ENOTCONN\f1
A datagram was sent, but no destination address was specified,
and the socket had not been connected.
.TP
\f4ENOBUFS\f1
The system ran out of memory for
fragmentation buffers or other internal data structure.
.TP
\f4EADDRNOTAVAIL\f1
An attempt was made to create a
socket with a local address that did not match any network interface,
or an
.SM IP
broadcast destination address was specified
and the network interface does not support broadcast.
.LP
The following errors
may occur when setting or getting
.SM IP
options:
.TP 20
\f4EINVAL\f1
An unknown socket option name was given.
.TP
\f4EINVAL\f1
The
.SM IP
option field was improperly formed;
an option field was shorter than the minimum value
or longer than the option buffer provided.
.SH NOTES
.LP
Raw sockets should receive
.SM ICMP
error packets relating to the protocol;
currently such packets are simply discarded.
.LP
Users of higher-level protocols such as
.SM TCP
and
.SM UDP
should be able to
see received
.SM IP
options.

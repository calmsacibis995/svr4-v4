.SH NAME
ICMP \- Internet Control Message Protocol
.SH SYNOPSIS

\f4#include <sys/socket.h>\f1
\f4#include <netinet/in.h>\f1
\f4#include <netinet/ip_icmp.h>\f1
.LP

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.SM ICMP
is the error and control message protocol used
by the Internet protocol family.
It is used by the kernel to handle and report errors
in protocol processing.
It may also be accessed by programs using the socket interface
or the Transport Level Interface
(\s-1TLI\s0)
for network monitoring
and diagnostic functions.
When used with the socket interface,
a \(lqraw socket\(rq type is used.
The protocol number for
.SM ICMP\s0,
used in the
.I proto
parameter to the socket call,
can be obtained from
\f4getprotobyname\f1(\|)
[see
\f4getprotoent\f1(3N)].
.SM ICMP
file descriptors and
sockets are connectionless,
and are normally used with the
\f4t_sndudata\f1 / \f4t_rcvudata\f1 and the
\f4sendto(\|)\f1 / \f4recvfrom(\|)\f1
calls.
.LP
Outgoing packets automatically have an Internet Protocol (\s-1IP\s0)
header prepended to them.
Incoming packets are provided to the user with the
.SM IP
header and options intact.
.LP
.SM ICMP
is an datagram protocol layered above
.SM IP\s0.
It is used internally by the protcol code
for various purposes including routing,
fault isolation,
and congestion control.
Receipt of an
.SM ICMP
\(lqredirect\(rq message will add a new entry in
the routing table,
or modify an existing one.
.SM ICMP
messages are routinely sent by the protocol code.
Received
.SM ICMP
messages may be reflected back to users
of higher-level protocols such as
.SM TCP
or
.SM UDP
as error returns from system calls.
A copy of all
.SM ICMP
message received by the system
is provided to every holder of an open
.SM ICMP
socket or
.SM TLI
descriptor.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.LP
A socket operation may fail with one of the following errors returned:
.TP 20
\f4EISCONN\f1
An attempt was made to establish a connection on a socket
which already has one, or when trying to send a datagram with the destination
address specified and the socket is already connected.
.TP
\f4ENOTCONN\f1
An attempt was made to send a datagram, but
no destination address is specified, and the socket has
not been connected.
.TP
\f4ENOBUFS\f1
The system ran out of memory for
an internal data structure.
.TP
\f4EADDRNOTAVAIL\f1
An attempt was made to create a
socket with a network address for which no network interface
exists.
.SH NOTES
.LP
Replies to
.SM ICMP
\(lqecho\(rq messages which are source routed
are not sent back using inverted source routes,
but rather go back through the normal routing mechanisms.

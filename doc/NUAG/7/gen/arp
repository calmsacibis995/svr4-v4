.SH NAME
ARP \- Address Resolution Protocol
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\f4#include <sys/socket.h>\f1
\f4#include <net/if_arp.h>\f1
\f4#include <netinet/in.h>\f1
.LP
\f4s = socket(\s-1AF_INET\s0, \s-1SOCK_DGRAM\s0, 0);\f1
.LP
\f4d = open ("/dev/arp", \s-1O_RDWR\s0);\f1
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.SM ARP
is a protocol used to map dynamically between
Internet Protocol (\s-1IP\s0)
and 10Mb/s Ethernet addresses.
It is
used by all the 10Mb/s Ethernet datalink providers (interface drivers).
It is not specific to the Internet Protocol
or to the 10Mb/s Ethernet, but this implementation
currently supports only that combination.
The
.SM STREAMS
device
\f4/dev/arp\f1
is not a
Transport Level Interface
(\s-1TLI\s0)
transport provider and
may not be used with the
.SM TLI
interface.
.LP
.SM ARP
caches
.SM IP\s0-to-Ethernet
address mappings.
When an interface
requests a mapping for an address not in the cache,
.SM ARP
queues the
message that requires the mapping and broadcasts
a message on the associated network requesting the address mapping.
If a response is provided, the new mapping is cached and any pending
message is transmitted.
.SM ARP
will queue
at most one packet while waiting for a mapping request to be responded to;
only the most recently \(lqtransmitted\(rq packet is kept.
.LP
To facilitate communications with systems which do not use
.SM ARP\s0,
\f4ioctl(\|)\f1
requests are provided to enter and delete entries in the
.SM IP\s0-to-Ethernet
tables.
.SH USAGE
.LP
.nf
.ft 4
	#include <sys/sockio.h>
	#include <sys/socket.h>
	#include <net/if.h>
	#include <net/if_arp.h>
	struct arpreq arpreq;
	ioctl(s, \s-1SIOCSARP\s0, (caddr_t)&arpreq);
	ioctl(s, \s-1SIOCGARP\s0, (caddr_t)&arpreq);
	ioctl(s, \s-1SIOCDARP\s0, (caddr_t)&arpreq);
.fi
.ft 1
.LP
Each
\f4ioctl(\|)\f1
request takes the same structure as an argument.
\f4SIOCSARP\f1
sets an
.SM ARP
entry,
\f4SIOCGARP\f1
gets an
.SM ARP
entry, and
\f4SIOCDARP\f1
deletes an
.SM ARP
entry.
These
\f4ioctl(\|)\f1
requests may be applied to any Internet family
socket descriptor
.IR s ,
or to a descriptor for the 
.SM ARP
device,
but only by the privileged user.
The
\f4arpreq\f1
structure contains:
.LP
.nf
.ft 4
/*
* ARP ioctl request
*/
struct arpreq {
	struct sockaddr arp_pa;     /* protocol address */
	struct sockaddr arp_ha;     /* hardware address */
	int             arp_flags;  /* flags */
};
/*  arp_flags field values */
#define ATF_COM          0x2  /* completed entry (arp_ha valid) */
#define ATF_PERM         0x4  /* permanent entry */
#define ATF_PUBL         0x8  /* publish (respond for other host) */
#define ATF_USETRAILERS  0x10 /* send trailer packets to host */
.fi
.ft 1
.LP
The address family for the
\f4arp_pa\f1
\f4sockaddr\f1 must be
\f4AF_INET\f1;
for the
\f4arp_ha\f1
\f4sockaddr\f1 it must be
\f4AF_UNSPEC\f1.
The only flag bits that may be written are
\f4ATF_PERM\f1,
\f4ATF_PUBL\f1
and
\f4ATF_USETRAILERS\f1.
\f4ATF_PERM\f1
makes the entry permanent if the
\f4ioctl(\|)\f1
request succeeds.
The peculiar nature of the
.SM ARP
tables may cause the
\f4ioctl(\|)\f1
request to fail if too many permanent
.SM IP
addresses hash to the same slot.
\f4ATF_PUBL\f1
specifies that the
.SM ARP
code should respond to
.SM ARP
requests for the indicated host coming from
other machines.
This allows a host to act as an
\(lq\s-1ARP\s0 server\(rq, which may be useful in convincing an
.SM ARP\s0-only
machine to talk to a non-\s-1ARP\s0 machine.
.LP
.SM ARP
is also used to negotiate the use of trailer
.SM IP
encapsulations; trailers are an alternate
encapsulation used to allow efficient packet
alignment for large packets despite variable-sized
headers.
Hosts that wish to receive trailer
encapsulations so indicate by sending gratuitous
.SM ARP
translation replies along with replies to
.SM IP
requests; they are also sent in reply to
.SM IP
translation replies.
The negotiation is thus
fully symmetrical, in that either or both hosts
may request trailers.
The
\f4ATF_USETRAILERS\f1
flag is used to record the receipt of such a reply,
and enables the transmission of trailer packets to that host.
.LP
.SM ARP
watches passively for hosts impersonating the local host (that is, a host
which responds to an
.SM ARP
mapping request for the local host's address).

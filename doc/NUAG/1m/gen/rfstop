.SH NAME
\f4rfstop\f1 \- stop the Remote File Sharing environment
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4rfstop\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4rfstop\fP disconnects a host from the Remote File
Sharing environment until another \f4rfstart\fP(1M) is
executed.

When executed on the domain name server, the domain name server responsibility
is moved to a secondary name server as designated in the \f4rfmaster\f1(4) file.
If there is no designated secondary name server \f4rfstop\f1 will issue
a warning message, Remote File Sharing will be stopped, and name service
will no longer be available to the domain.
.P
This command is restricted to the super-user.
.SH ERRORS
If (1) there are resources currently advertised by this host, (2) resources from
this machine are still remotely mounted by other hosts, (3) there
are still remotely mounted resources in the local file system tree, (4)
\f4rfstart\fP(1M)
had not previously been executed, or (5) 
the command is not run with super-user privileges, an error message will
be sent to standard error and Remote File Sharing will not be stopped.

.SH NAME
\f4mount\f1 \- mount remote resources
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4mount [-F rfs] [-cr] [-o \f2specific_options\f4] \f2resource directory\f4
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\f4mount\f1
command makes a remote \f2resource\f1
available to users from the mount point \f2directory\f1.
The command adds an entry to the table of mounted devices, \f4/etc/mnttab\f1.
.P
If multiple transport providers are installed and administrators attempt
to mount a resource over them, the transport
providers should be specified as network IDs in the
\f4/etc/netconfig\f1 file.  The NETPATH environment variable
can be used to specify the sequence of transport providers
\f4mount\f1 will use to attempt a connection to a server machine
(\f4NETPATH=tcp:starlan\f1).  If only one transport provider is
installed and \f4/etc/netconfig\f1
has not been set up, all resources will be mounted over this
transport provider by default.
.P
The following options are available:
.TP 0.75i
\f4-F rfs\f1
Specifies the \f4rfs\fP-FSType.
.TP 0.75i
\f4\-c\f1
Disable client caching.
This is the same as \f4\-o nocaching\f1.
.TP 0.75i
\f4\-r\f1
\f2resource\f1 is to be mounted read-only.  If the
\f2resource\f1 is write-protected, this flag or the \f4\-o ro\f1 
specific option must be used.
.TP 0.75i
\f4\-o \f1
Specify the \f4rfs\fP file system specific options in a
comma-separated list.
The available options are:
.RS
.IP \f4nocaching\f1 15
Disable client caching.
.IP \f4rw|ro\f1
\f2resource\f1 is to be mounted read/write or read-only.
The default is read/write.
.IP \f4suid|nosuid\f1
Set-uid bits are to be obeyed or ignored, respectively, on
execution. The default is \f4nosuid\f1.
.sp 0.5
Note that mounting a resource from an untrusted server
introduces possible security risks.
While the use of \f4nosuid\fP protects against some risks, it is not
completely effective.
The best defense against such security risks is to avoid such mounts.

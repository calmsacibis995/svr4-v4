.SH NAME
\f4dfshares\f1 \- list available RFS resources from remote systems
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4dfshares\f1
[\f4\-F rfs\fP]

[\f2server\fP .\ .\ .]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4dfshares\f1
provides information about resources available to the host through
Remote File Sharing.  The \f4\-F\fP flag may be omitted if \f4rfs\f1 is
the first file system type listed in the file \f4/etc/dfs/fstypes\fP.
.P
The query may be restricted to the output of resources available
from one or more servers.  If no \f2server\fP is specified,
all resources in the host's domain are displayed.  A \f2server\fP
may be given in the following form:
.RS
.IP \f2system\fP 1i
Specifies a system in the host's domain.
.IP \f2domain.\fP 1i
Specifies all systems in \f2domain\fP.
.IP \f2domain.system\fP 1i
Specifies \f2system\fP in \f2domain\fP.
.RE
.P
The output of \f4dfshares\fP consists of an optional header line
(suppressed with the \f4\-h\fP flag) followed by a list of lines
containing whitespace-separated fields.  For each resource, the
fields are:
.P
.RS
\f2resource server access transport description\fP
.RE
where
.RS
.IP \f2resource\fP 1i
Specifies the resource name that must be given to the \f4mount\fP(1M)
command.
.IP \f2server\fP 1i
Specifies the system that is making the resource available.
.IP \f2access\fP 1i
Specifies the access permissions granted to the client systems, either
\f4ro\fP (for read-only) or \f4rw\fP (for read and write).
.IP \f2transport\fP 1i
Specifies the transport provider over which the \f2resource\fP is shared.
.IP \f2description\fP 1i
Describes the resource.
.RE
.P
A field may be null.
Each null field is indicated by a
hyphen (\-) unless the remainder of the fields on the line
are also null.
In this case, it may be omitted.

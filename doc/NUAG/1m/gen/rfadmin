.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4rfadmin\f1 is used to add and remove hosts, and their associated 
authentication information, from a \f2domain\f4/passwd\f1 file on
a Remote File Sharing primary domain name server.
It is also used to transfer domain name server responsibilities
from one machine to another.
Used with no options, \f4rfadmin\f1 returns the \f2hostname\f1 of the current
domain name server for the local domain on each of the transport providers that
span the domain.
.P
\f4rfadmin\f1 can only be used to modify domain files on the primary
domain name server (\f4\-a\f1 and \f4\-r\f1 options).  If domain name server
responsibilities are temporarily passed to a secondary domain name server,
that computer can use the \f4\-p\f1 option to pass domain name server responsibility
back to the primary.  The command can be directed to a specific set
of transport providers by using the \f4-t\f1 option with a comma-separated
list of transport providers.  Any host can use \f4rfadmin\fP with no options
to print information about the domain.  The user must have
\f4root\f1 permissions to use this command, except in the case
when the \-q option is used.
.TP 1.2i
\-a \f2hostname\f1
Add a host to a domain that is served by this domain name server.
\f2hostname\f1 must be of the form \f2domain.nodename\f1.
It creates an entry for \f2hostname\f1 in the \f2domain\f4/passwd\f1
file and prompts for an initial authentication password;
the password prompting process conforms with that of
\f4passwd\fP(1).
.TP
\-r \f2hostname\f1
Remove a host, \f2hostname\f1, from its domain by removing
it from the \f2domain\f4/passwd\f4 file.
.TP
\-p
Used to pass the domain name server responsibilities back to a primary
or to a secondary name server.
.TP
\-t \f2transport1, transport2 ...\f1
Select transport provider(s).  The \-t option is used
only with the \-p option.
.TP
\-q
Tells if RFS is running.
.TP
\-o \f2option\f1
Sets RFS system option.  \f2option\f1 is one of the following:
.br
.sp
\f4loopback\f1 - Enable loop back facility.  This allows a resource
advertised by a computer to be mounted by the same computer.
\f4loopback\f1 is off by default.
.br
.sp
\f4noloopback\f1 - Turn off the loop back facility. \f4noloopback\f1
is the default.
.br
.sp
\f4loopmode\f1 - Check if the loop back facility is on or off.
.P
.SH ERRORS
When used with the \f2\-a\f1 option, if \f2hostname\f1
is not unique in the domain, an error message will be sent
to standard error.
.P
When used with the \f2\-r\f1 option, if (1) \f2hostname\f1 does not
exist in the domain, (2) \f2hostname\f1 is defined as a domain name server,
or (3) there are resources
advertised by \f2hostname\f1, an error message will be sent to standard error.
.P
When used with the \f2\-p\f1 option to change the domain name
server, if there are no backup name servers defined for
\f2domain\f1, an error message will be sent to standard error.
.SH FILES
.TP
\f4/etc/rfs/auth.info/\f2domain\fP/passwd\f1
For each \f2domain\f1, this file is created on the primary,
copied to all secondaries, and copied to all hosts that
want to do password verification of hosts in the \f2domain\f1.

.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4dfshares\f1
provides information about resources available to the host through
a distributed file system of type \f2fstype\f1.
\f2Specific_options\f1 as well as the
semantics of \f2server\f1 are specific to particular distributed
file systems.
.P
If \f4dfshares\f1 is entered without arguments, all resources 
currently shared on the local system are displayed, regardless 
of file system type.
.P
The output of \f4dfshares\f1 consists of an optional header line
(suppressed with the \f4\-h\f1 flag) followed by a list of lines
containing whitespace-separated fields.  For each resource, the
fields are:
.LP
.RS 8
\f2resource server access transport description ...\f1
.RE

.RS 5
.IP \f2resource\f1 15
Specifies the resource name that must be given to the \f4mount\f1(1M)
command.
.IP \f2server\f1 15
Specifies the name of the system that is making the resource available.
.IP \f2access\f1 15
Specifies the access permissions granted to the client systems, either
\f4ro\f1 (for read-only) or \f4rw\f1 (for read/write).
If \f3dfshares\f1 cannot determine access permissions, a hyphen 
(\f4\-\f1)
is displayed.
.IP \f2transport\f1 15
Specifies the transport provider over which the \f2resource\f1 is shared.
.IP \f2description\f1 15
Describes the resource.
.RE

A field may be null. Each null field is indicated by a
hyphen (\-) unless the remainder of the fields on the line
are also null.  In this case, it may be omitted.

.SH NAME
\f4spray\f1 \- spray packets
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/usr/sbin/spray\f1 [ \f4\-c\f1 \f2count\f1 ] [ \f4\-d\f1 \f2delay\f1 ] [ \f4\-l\f1 \f2length\f1 ] [ \f4\-t\f1 \f2 nettype\f1 \f2host\f1 ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\f4spray\f1
sends a one-way stream of packets to
\f2host\f1
using
\s-1RPC\s0,
and reports how many were received, as
well as the the transfer rate.
The
\f2host\f1
argument can be either a name or an Internet address.
.P
The following options are available:
.TP 15
\f4\-c \f2count\f1
Specify how many packets to send.
The default value of
\f2count\f1
is the number of packets required
to make the total stream size 100000 bytes.
.TP
\f4\-d \f2delay\f1
Specify how many microseconds to pause between
sending each packet.
The default is 0.
.TP
\f4\-l \f2length\f1
The
\f2length\f1
parameter is the numbers of bytes in the
Ethernet packet that holds the
\s-1RPC\s0
call message.
Since the data is encoded using
\s-1XDR\s0,
and
\s-1XDR\s0
only deals with 32 bit quantities,
not all values of
\f2length\f1
are possible, and
\f4spray\f1
rounds up to the nearest possible value.
When
\f2length\f1
is greater than 1514, then the
\s-1RPC\s0
call can no longer be
encapsulated in one Ethernet packet, so the
\f2length\f1
field
no longer has a simple correspondence to Ethernet packet size.
The default value of
\f2length\f1
is 86 bytes (the size of the
\s-1RPC\s0
and
\s-1UDP\s0
headers).
.TP
\f4\-t \f2nettype\f1
Specify clas of transports.
Defaults to 
\f4netpath\f1.
See
\f4rpc\f1(3N)
for a description of supported classes.

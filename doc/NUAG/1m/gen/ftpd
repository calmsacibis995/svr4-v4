.SH NAME
\f4ftpd\f1 \- file transfer protocol server
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4in.ftpd\f1
[
\f4\-dl\f1
] [
\f4\-t\f2timeout\f1
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4ftpd\f1
is the
Internet File Transfer Protocol (\s-1FTP\s0)
server process.
The server is invoked by the Internet daemon
\f4inetd\f1(1M)
each time a connection to the
.SM FTP
service [see
\f4services\f1(4)]
is made, with the connection available as descriptor 0.
.LP
Inactive connections are timed out after 90 seconds.
.LP
The following options are available:
.TP
\f4-d\f1
Write Debugging information into the system log.
.TP
\f4-l\f1
Write each FTP session into the system log.
.TP
\f4\-t\f2timeout\f1
Set the inactivity timeout period to
\f2timeout\f1,
in seconds.
The
.SM FTP
server will timeout an inactive session after 15 minutes.
.SS Requests
.LP

.SM FTP
server currently supports the following

.LP
The remaining
.SM FTP
requests specified in
.SM RFC
959 are recognized, but not implemented.
.LP
The
.SM FTP
server will abort an active file transfer only when the
\f4ABOR\f1
command is preceded by a Telnet \(lqInterrupt Process\(rq (IP)
signal and a Telnet \(lqSynch\(rq signal in the command Telnet stream,
as described in
.SM RFC
959.
.LP
\f4ftpd\f1
interprets file names according to the \(lqglobbing\(rq
conventions used by
\f4sh\f1(1).
This allows users to utilize the metacharacters:
\f4* ? [ ] { } ~\f1
.LP
\f4ftpd\f1
authenticates users according to four rules.
.TP
1)
The user name must be in the password data base,
\f4/etc/passwd\f1,
and not have a null password.  In this case a password
must be provided by the client before any file operations
may be performed.
.TP
2)
If the user name appears in the file
\f4/etc/ftpusers\f1, \f4ftp\f1 access is denied.
.TP
3)
\f4ftp\f1 access is denied unless the
user's shell (from \f4/etc/passwd\f1) is listed in the file 
\f4/etc/shells\f1, 
or the user's shell is one of the following:
.nf
\f4/bin/sh
/bin/ksh
/bin/csh
/usr/bin/sh
/usr/bin/ksh
/usr/bin/csh\f1
.fi
.TP
4)
If the user name is \(lqanonymous\(rq or \(lqftp\(rq, an
anonymous
.SM FTP
account must be present in the password
file (user \(lqftp\(rq).  In this case the user is allowed
to log in by specifying any password (by convention this
is given as the client host's name).
.LP
In the last case,
\f4ftpd\f1
takes special measures to restrict the client's access privileges.
The server performs a
\f4chroot\f1(2)
command to the home directory of the \(lqftp\(rq user.
In order that system security is not breached, it is recommended
that the \(lqftp\(rq subtree be constructed with care;  the following
rules are recommended.
.TP 8
\f2home_directory\f1
Make the home directory owned by \f4ftp\f1 and unwritable by anyone.
.TP 8
\f2home_directory\f4/usr/bin\f1
Make this directory owned by the super-user and unwritable by
anyone.  The program
\f4ls\f1(1)
must be present to support the list commands.  This
program should have mode 111.
.TP 8
\f2home_directory\f4/etc\f1
Make this directory owned by the super-user and unwritable by
anyone.  Copies of the files
\f4passwd\f1(4), \f4group\f1(4), and \f4netconfig\f1
must be present for the
\f4ls\f1
command to work properly.  These files should be mode 444.
.TP 8
\f2home_directory\f4/pub\f1
Make this directory mode 777 and owned by \f4ftp\f1.  Users
should then place files which are to be accessible via the
anonymous account in this directory.
.TP 8
\f2home_directory\f4/dev\f1
Make this directory owned by the super-user and unwritable
by anyone.  Change directories to this directory and do the
following:
.LP
.nf
.ft 4
FTP="`grep ^ftp: /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f6`"
MAJORMINOR="`ls -l /dev/tcp | nawk '{ gsub(/,/, ""); print $5, $6}'`
mknod $FTP/dev/tcp c $MAJORMINOR
chmod 666 $FTP/dev/tcp
.fi

.SH NOTES
The anonymous account is inherently dangerous
and should be avoided when possible.
.LP
The server must run as the super-user to create sockets with privileged
port numbers.  It maintains an effective user ID of the logged in user,
changing to user ID 0 only when binding addresses to sockets.
The possible security holes have been extensively scrutinized, but are
possibly incomplete.
.LP
\f4/etc/ftpusers\f1 contains a list of users 
who cannot access the system; the format of the file is
one username per line.

.SH NAME
\f4rfuadmin\f1 \- Remote File Sharing notification shell script
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/etc/rfs/rfuadmin \f2message remote_resource \f1[\f2seconds\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4rfuadmin\f1 administrative shell script responds to unexpected
Remote File Sharing events,
such as broken network connections and forced unmounts,
picked up by the \f4rfudaemon\f1 process.  This command is not intended
to be run directly from the shell.
.P
The response to messages received by \f4rfudaemon\f1 can be tailored to suit the
particular system by editing the \f4rfuadmin\f1 script.
The following paragraphs describe the arguments passed to
\f4rfuadmin\f1 and the responses.
.P
.PD 0
.TP 8
\f4disconnect \f2remote_resource\f1
A link to a remote resource has been cut.  \f4rfudaemon\f1
executes\p
.br
\f4rfuadmin\f1, passing it the message \f4disconnect\f1 and
the name of the disconnected resource. 
\f4rfuadmin\f1 sends this message to all terminals using \f4wall\f1(1):
.sp
\f2Remote_resource\f4 has been disconnected from the system.\f1
.sp
Then it executes \f4fuser\f1(1M) to kill all processes using the
resource, unmounts the resource [\f4umount\f1(1M)] to clean up the kernel, and
starts \f4rmount\f1 to try to remount the resource.
.TP 8
\f4fumount \f2remote_resource\f1
A remote server machine has forced an unmount of a resource
a local machine has mounted.  The processing is similar to processing
for a disconnect.
.TP 8
\f4fuwarn \f2remote_resource seconds\f1
This message notifies \f4rfuadmin\f1 that a
resource is about to be unmounted.  \f4rfudaemon\f1 sends this script the
\f4fuwarn\f1 message, the resource name, and the number of seconds in which
the forced unmount will occur.
\f4rfuadmin\f1 sends this message to all terminals:
.sp
\f2Remote_resource\f4 is being removed from the system in \f2#\f4 seconds.

.SH "NOTES"
The console must be on when Remote File Sharing is running.
If it's not,\p
.br
\f4rfuadmin\f1 will hang when it tries to write to 
the console (\f4wall\f1) and recovery from disconnected resources
will not complete.

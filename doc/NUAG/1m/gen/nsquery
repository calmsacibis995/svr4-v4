.SH NAME
\f4nsquery\f1 \- Remote File Sharing name server query
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4nsquery\f1
[\f4\-h\f1] [\f2name\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4nsquery\fP provides information about resources available to the host from
both the local domain and from other domains.
All resources are reported, regardless of whether the host is authorized to access them.
When used with no options, \f4nsquery\fP identifies all resources in
the domain that have been advertised as sharable.
A report on selected resources can be obtained by specifying \f2name\f1,
where \f2name\f1 is:
.IP \f2nodename\f1 17
The report will include only those resources available from \f2nodename\f1.
.IP \f2domain.\f1 17
The report will include only those resources available from \f2domain\f1.
.IP \f2domain.nodename\f1 17
The report will include only those resources available from \f2domain.nodename\f1.
.P
When the name does not include the delimiter ".", it will
be interpreted as a \f2nodename\f1 within the local domain. 
If the name ends with a delimiter ".",
it will be interpreted as a domain name.
.P
The information contained in the report on each resource includes
its advertised name (\f2domain.resource\fP),
the read/write permissions,
the server (\f2nodename.domain\fP) that advertised the resource, and
a brief textual description.
.P
When \f4\-h\f1 is used, the header is not printed.
.P
A remote domain must be listed in your \f4rfmaster\f1 file in order
to query that domain.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
If no entries are found when \f4nsquery\fP is executed,
the report header is printed.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
\f4adv\fP(1M),
\f4unadv\fP(1M),
\f4rfmaster\fP(4)
.SH NOTES
If your host cannot contact the domain name server,
an error message will be sent to standard error.

.SH NAME
\f4lockd\f1 \- network lock daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/usr/lib/nfs/lockd\f1
[
\f4\-t\f1
.I timeout
] [
\f4\-g\f1
.I graceperiod
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\f4lockd\f1
processes lock requests that are either
sent locally by the kernel or remotely by another lock daemon.
\f4lockd\f1
forwards lock requests for remote data to the server site's
lock daemon through
\s-1RPC/XDR\s0.
\f4lockd\f1
then requests the status monitor daemon,
\f4statd\f1(1M),
for monitor service.  The reply to the lock request will not be sent
to the kernel until
the status daemon and the server site's
lock daemon have replied.
.LP
If either the
status monitor or server site's lock daemon
is unavailable, the reply to a lock request for remote data
is delayed until all daemons become available.
.LP
When a server recovers,
it waits for a grace period for all client-site lock daemons to submit
reclaim requests.
Client-site lock daemons, on the other hand, are notified by 
the status monitor daemon
of the server recovery and promptly resubmit previously
granted lock requests.  If a lock daemon
fails to secure a previously granted lock at the server site, the
it sends
.SM SIGLOST
to a process.
.SH OPTIONS

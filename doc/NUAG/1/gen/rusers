.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
The
\f4rusers\f1
command produces output similar to

but for remote machines.

but this order can be
changed by specifying one of the options listed below.
.P

of the users logged in.

additional information is printed for each user,
including idle time, when user logged in, and tty.
.P
A remote host will only respond if it is running the
\f4rusersd\f1(1M)
daemon, which may be started up from
\f4inetd\f1(1M)
or
\f4listen\f1(1M).

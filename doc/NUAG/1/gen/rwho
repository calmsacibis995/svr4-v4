.SH NAME
\f4rwho\f1 \- who's logged in on local machines
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4rwho\f1
[
\f4\-a\f1
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The
\f4rwho\f1
command produces output similar to
\f4who\f1(1),
but for all machines on your network.
If no report has been
received from a machine for 5 minutes,
\f4rwho\f1
assumes the machine is down, and does not report users last known
to be logged into that machine.
.LP
If a user has not typed to the system for a minute or more,
\f4rwho\f1
reports this idle time.
If a user has not typed to the system for
an hour or more, the user is omitted from the output of
\f4rwho\f1
unless the
\f4\-a\f1
flag is given.
.LP
The 
\f4\-a\f1
option reports all users whether or not they have typed
to the system in the past hour.
.SH FILES
.PD 
.TP 35
\f4/var/spool/rwho/whod.*\f1

.SH SEE ALSO

\f4ruptime\f1(1),
\f4who\f1(1),
\f4rwhod\f1(1M)
.SH NOTES
.LP
Does not work through gateways.
.LP
This is unwieldy when the number of machines
on the local net is large.
.LP
The
\f4rwho\f1
service daemon,
\f4rwhod\f1(1M),
must be enabled for this command to return useful results.

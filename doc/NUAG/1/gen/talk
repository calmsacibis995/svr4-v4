.SH NAME
\f4talk\f1 \- talk to another user
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4talk\f1
.I username
[
.I ttyname
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\f4talk\f1
is a visual communication program that
copies lines from your terminal
to that of a user on the same or on another host.
.I username
is that user's login name.
.LP
The program is architecture dependent; it works only 
between machines of the same architecture.
.LP
If you want to talk to a user who is logged in more
than once, the
.I ttyname
argument may be used to indicate the appropriate terminal name.
.LP
When first called,
\f4talk\f1
sends the message:
.P
.RS
\f4Message from TalkDaemon@ \f2her_machine\fP at \f2time .\|.\|.\f1
.br
\f4talk: connection requested by \f2your_name\fP@\f2your_machine\f1
.br
\f4talk: respond with: talk \f2your_name\fP@\f2your_machine\f1
.RE
.LP
to the user you want to talk to.
At this point, the recipient of the
message should reply by typing:
.IP
\f4talk \f2your_name\f4@\f2your_machine\f1
.LP
It does not matter from which machine the
recipient replies, as long as the login name
is the same.
Once communication is established, the two
parties may type simultaneously,
with their output appearing in separate windows.
Typing
CTRL-l
redraws the screen,
while your erase, kill, and word kill
characters will work in
\f4talk\f1
as normal.
To exit, just type your interrupt character;
\f4talk\f1
then moves the cursor to the bottom
of the screen and restores the terminal.
.LP
Permission to talk may be denied or granted by use of the
\f4mesg\f1(1)
command.
At the outset talking is allowed.
Certain commands, such as
\f4pr\f1(1),
disallow messages in order to prevent messy output.

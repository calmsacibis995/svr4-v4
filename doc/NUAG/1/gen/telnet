.SH NAME
\f4telnet\f1 \- user interface to a remote system using the 
\s-1TELNET\s0 protocol
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4telnet\f1
[
.I host
[
.I port
] ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\f4telnet\f1
communicates with another host using the
.SM TELNET
protocol.  If
\f4telnet\f1
is invoked without arguments, it enters command mode, indicated by its
prompt 
\f4telnet>\f1.
In this mode, it accepts and executes the
commands listed below.  If it is
invoked with arguments, it performs an
\f4open\f1
command (see
``Telnet Commands''
below) with those arguments.
.LP
Once a connection has been opened,
\f4telnet\f1
enters input mode.  In this mode, text
typed is sent to the remote host.
The input mode entered will be either
\(lqcharacter at a time\(rq
or \(lqline by line\(rq
depending on what the remote system supports.
.LP
In \(lqcharacter at a time\(rq mode, most
text typed is immediately sent to the remote host for processing.
.LP
In \(lqline by line\(rq mode, all text is echoed locally,
and (normally) only completed lines are sent to the remote host.
The \(lqlocal echo character\(rq (initially
\f4^E\f1)
may be used
to turn off and on the local echo
(this would mostly be used to enter passwords
without the password being echoed).
.LP
In either mode, if the
.I localchars
toggle is
.SM TRUE
(the default in line mode; see below),
the user's
\f4quit\f1,
\f4intr\f1,
and
\f4flush\f1
characters are trapped locally, and sent as
.SM TELNET
protocol sequences to the remote side.
There are options (see
\f4toggle\f1,
\f4autoflush\f1,
and
\f4toggle\f1,
\f4autosynch\f1)
which cause this action to flush subsequent output to the terminal
(until the remote host acknowl\%edges the
.SM TELNET
sequence) and flush previous terminal input
(in the case of
\f4quit\f1
and
\f4intr\f1).
.LP
While connected to a remote host,
\f4telnet\f1
command mode may be entered by typing the
\f4telnet\f1
escape character (initially
\f4^]\f1).
When in command
mode, the normal terminal editing conventions are available.
.SH USAGE
.SS Telnet Commands
.LP
The following commands are available.
Only enough of each command to uniquely identify it need be typed
(this is also true for arguments to the
\f4mode\f1,
\f4set\f1,
\f4toggle\f1,
and
\f4display\f1
commands).
.LP
.TP
\f4open \fIhost\fP \fR[\fP \fIport\fP \fR]\fP\f1
Open a connection to the named host.  If no port number
is specified,
\f4telnet\f1
will attempt to contact a
.SM TELNET
server at the default port.
The host specification may be either a host name [see
\f4hosts\f1(4)]
or an Internet address specified in the \(lqdot notation\(rq [see
\f4inet\f1(7)].
.TP
\f4close\f1
Close any open
.SM TELNET
session and exit
\f4telnet\f1.
An
.SM EOF
(in command mode) will also close a session and exit.
.TP
\f4quit\f1
Same as \f4close\f1, above.
.TP
\f4z\f1
Suspend
\f4telnet\f1.
This command only works when the user is using a shell that supports
job control, such as
\f4sh\f1(1).
.TP
\f4mode \fItype\fP\f1
.I type
is either
\f4line\f1
(for \(lqline by line\(rq mode)
or
.I character
(for \(lqcharacter at a time\(rq mode).
The remote host is asked for permission to go into the requested mode.
If the remote host is capable of entering that mode, the requested
mode will be entered.
.TP
\f4status\f1
Show the current status of
\f4telnet\f1.
This includes the peer one is connected to, as well
as the current mode.
.br
.ne 8
.TP
\f4display \fR[\fP \fIargument...\fP \fR]\fP\f1
Display all, or some, of the
\f4set\f1
and
\f4toggle\f1
values (see
\f4toggle\f1,
\f2arguments\f1).
.TP
\f4? \fR[\fP \fIcommand\fP \fR]\fP\f1
Get help.  With no arguments,
\f4telnet\f1
print a help summary.
If a command is specified,
\f4telnet\f1
will print the help information for just that command.
.TP
\f4send \fIarguments\fP\f1
Send one or more special character sequences to the remote host.
The following are the arguments which may be specified
(more than one argument may be specified at a time):
.RS
.TP
\f4escape\f1
Send the current
\f4telnet\f1
escape character (initially
\f4^]\f1).
.TP
\f4synch\f1
Send the
.SM TELNET
\f4SYNCH\f1
sequence.
This sequence discards all previously typed
(but not yet read) input on the remote system.
This sequence is sent as
.SM TCP
urgent data (and may not work if the remote system is a 4.2
.SM BSD
system \(em if it does not work, a lower
case \(lqr\(rq may be echoed on the terminal).
.TP
\f4brk\f1
Send the
.SM TELNET 
\f4BRK\f1
(Break) sequence, which may have significance to the remote
system.
.TP
\f4ip\f1
Send the
.SM TELNET 
\f4IP\f1
(Interrupt Process) sequence, which aborts
the currently running process on the remote system.
.TP
\f4ao\f1
Sends the
.SM TELNET 
\f4AO\f1
(Abort Output) sequence, which flushes
all output
\f4from\f1
the remote system
\f4to\f1
the user's terminal.
.TP
\f4ayt\f1
Sends the
.SM TELNET 
\f4AYT\f1
(Are You There)
sequence, to which the remote system may or may not choose to respond.
.TP
\f4ec\f1
Sends the
.SM TELNET 
\f4EC\f1
(Erase Character)
sequence, which erases the last character
entered.
.TP
\f4el\f1
Sends the
.SM TELNET 
\f4EL\f1
(Erase Line)
sequence, which should cause the remote system to erase the line currently
being entered.
.TP
\f4ga\f1
Sends the
.SM TELNET 
\f4GA\f1
(Go Ahead)
sequence, which likely has no significance to the remote system.
.TP
\f4nop\f1
Sends the
.SM TELNET
\f4NOP\f1
(No Operation)
sequence.
.TP
\f4?\f1
Prints out help information for the
\f4send\f1
command.
.RE
.TP
\f4set \fIargument value\fP\f1
Set any one of a number of
\f4telnet\f1
variables to a specific value.
The special value \(lqoff\(rq turns off the function associated with
the variable.
The values of variables may be interrogated with the
\f4display\f1
command.
The variables which may be specified are:
.RS
.TP
\f4echo\f1
This is the value (initially
\f4^E\f1)
which, when in
\(lqline by line\(lq mode, toggles between doing local echoing
of entered characters (for normal processing), and suppressing
echoing of entered characters (for example, entering a password).
.TP
\f4escape\f1
This is the
\f4telnet\f1
escape character (initially
\f4^]\f1)
which enters\p \%\f4telnet\f1
command mode (when connected to a remote system).
.TP
\f4interrupt\f1
If
\f4telnet\f1
is in
\f4localchars\f1
mode (see
\f4toggle\f1
\f4localchars\f1)
and the
\f4interrupt\f1
character is typed, a
.SM TELNET 
\f4IP\f1
sequence (see
\f4send\f1 and
\f4ip\f1)
is sent to the remote host.
The initial value for the interrupt character is taken to be
the terminal's
\f4intr\f1
character.
.TP
\f4quit\f1
If
\f4telnet\f1
is in
\f4localchars\f1

The initial value for the quit character is taken to be
the terminal's
\f4quit\f1
character.
.br
.ne 5
.TP
\f4flushoutput\f1
If
\f4telnet\f1
is in
\f4localchars\f1
mode (see
\f4toggle\f1
\f4localchars\f1)
and the
\f4flushoutput\f1
character is typed, a

\f4ao\f1)
is sent to the remote host.
The initial value for the flush character is taken to be
the terminal's
\f4flush\f1
character.
.TP

If
\f4telnet\f1
is in
\f4localchars\f1
mode (see
\f4toggle\f1
\f4localchars\f1),
\f4and\f1
if
\f4telnet\f1
is operating in \(lqcharacter at a time\(rq mode, then when this
character is typed, a
.SM TELNET
\f4EC\f1
sequence (see
\f4send\f1,
\f4ec\f1)
is sent to the remote system.
The initial value for the erase character is taken to be
the terminal's
\f4erase\f1
character.
.TP
\f4kill\f1
If
\f4telnet\f1
is in
\f4localchars\f1
mode (see
\f4toggle\f1
\f4localchars\f1),
\f4and\f1
if
\f4telnet\f1
is operating in \(lqcharacter at a time\(rq mode, then when this
character is typed, a

The initial value for the kill character is taken to be
the terminal's
\f4kill\f1
character.
.TP
\f4eof\f1
If
\f4telnet\f1
is operating in \(lqline by line\(rq mode, entering this character
as the first character on a line sends this character to the remote system.
The initial value of the eof character is taken to be the terminal's
\f4eof\f1
character.
.RE
.TP
\f4toggle \fIarguments...\fP\f1
Toggle (between
.SM TRUE
and
.SM FALSE\s0)
various flags that control how
\f4telnet\f1
responds to events.
More than one argument may be specified.
The state of these flags may be interrogated with the
\f4display\f1
command.
Valid arguments are:
.RS
.TP
\f4autoflush\f1
If
\f4autoflush\f1
and
\f4localchars\f1
are both
.SM TRUE\s0,
then when the
\f4ao\f1,
\f4intr\f1,
or
\f4quit\f1
characters are recognized (and transformed into\p
.br
.SM TELNET
sequences; see
\f4set\f1
for details),
\f4telnet\f1
refuses to display any data on the user's terminal
until the remote system \%acknowledges (using a
.SM TELNET
\f4Timing Mark\f1
option)
that it has processed those
.SM TELNET
sequences.
The initial value for this toggle is
.SM TRUE
if the terminal user had not
done an \(lqstty noflsh\(rq, otherwise
.SM FALSE
[see
\f4stty\f1(1)].
.TP
\f4autosynch\f1
If
\f4autosynch\f1
and
\f4localchars\f1
are both
.SM TRUE\s0,
then when either the
\f4intr\f1
or
.I quit
characters are typed (see
\f4set\f1
for descriptions of the
\f4intr\f1
and
\f4quit\f1
characters), the resulting
.SM TELNET
sequence sent is followed by the
.SM TELNET
\f4SYNCH\f1
sequence.
This procedure
\f4should\f1
cause the remote system to begin throwing away all previously
typed input until both of the
.SM TELNET
sequences have been read and acted upon.
The initial value of this toggle is
.SM FALSE\s0.
.TP
\f4crmod\f1
Toggle 
.SM RETURN 
mode.
When this mode is enabled, most 
.SM RETURN 
characters received from
the remote host will be mapped into a 
.SM RETURN 
followed by
a line feed.
This mode does not affect those characters typed by the user, only
those received from the remote host.
This mode is not very useful unless the remote host
only sends 
\s-1RETURN\s0, but never \s-1LINEFEED\s0.
The initial value for this toggle is
.SM FALSE\s0.
.TP
\f4debug\f1
Toggle socket level debugging (useful only to the
super-user).
The initial value for this toggle is
.SM FALSE .
.TP
\f4localchars\f1
If this is
.SM TRUE ,
then the
\f4flush\f1,
\f4interrupt\f1,
\f4quit\f1,
\f4erase\f1,
and
\f4kill\f1
characters (see
\f4set\f1)
are recognized locally, and
transformed into appropriate
.SM TELNET
control sequences
(respectively
\f4ao\f1,
\f4ip\f1,
\f4brk\f1,
\f4ec\f1,
and
\f4el\f1;
see
\f4send\f1).
The initial value for this toggle is
.SM TRUE
in \(lqline by line\(rq mode, and
.SM FALSE
in \(lqcharacter at a time\(rq mode.
.TP
\f4netdata\f1
Toggle the display of all network data (in hexadecimal format).
The initial value for this toggle is
.SM FALSE\s0.
.TP
\f4options\f1
Toggle the display of some internal
\f4telnet\f1
protocol processing\p
.br
.ne 1i
(having to do with
.SM TELNET
options).
The initial value for this toggle is
.SM FALSE\s0.
.TP
\f4?\f1
Display the legal
\f4toggle\f1
commands.

.SH NOTES
Do not attempt to run \f4layers\f1(1) while using \f4telnet\f1.
.LP
There is no adequate way for dealing with flow control.
.LP
On some remote systems, echo has to be turned off manually when in
\(lqline by line\(rq mode.
.LP
There is enough settable state to justify a
\f4.telnetrc\f1
file.
.LP
In \(lqline by line\(rq mode, the terminal's
.SM EOF
character is only recognized (and sent to the remote system)
when it is the first character on a line.

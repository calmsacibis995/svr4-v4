.SH NAME
\f4scsi_ad\fP \- SCSI device address structure
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4#include <sys/sdi.h>\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
The SCSI device address structure is used by every \f4scb\f1(D4I) or \f4sfb\f1(D4I)
structure with the appropriate SCSI device.  SDI interprets the external major
and minor numbers, the logical unit number, and the extended logical unit
number to send the \f4scb\f1 or \f4sfb\f1 to the correct device.
.SH STRUCTURE MEMBERS
.ft 4
.nf
long           sa_major;   /* Major number */
long           sa_minor;   /* Minor number */
unsigned char  sa_lun;     /* logical unit number */
unsigned char  sa_exlun;   /* extended logical unit number */
short          sa_fill;    /* Fill word */

.P
This structure consists of the device number, which is passed to
the target driver by the kernel, and the logical unit number.
The \f4sa_major\f1 and \f4sa_minor\f1 members (external major/minor numbers)
are long integers to allow for 
future expansion of the major and minor numbers.
.SH NOTES
Use of the \f4sa_exlun\f1 member is not supported for the 3B2 computer.
The major number is decoded by SDI to determine the host adapter and target
controller.  The minor number is typically used only by the target driver to
determine the logical unit and any other device specific information (partition
of a disk or density of a tape).  SDI determines the logical unit from
\f4sa_lun\f1.  This member may take on the values 0 to 7, except when extended
unit numbering is used.  In this case, the
.SM EXLUN
value is set in the
\f4sa_lun\f1 member, and the \f4sa_exlun\f1 member is set the appropriate
value.
.P
For example, if the target controller wanted to access extended
logical unit 0x021a, then \f4sa_lun\f1 would equal 0x82, and \f4sa_exlun\f1
would equal 0x1a.

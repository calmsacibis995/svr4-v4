.SH NAME
\f4scb\fP \- SCSI control block structure
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4#include <sys/sdi.h>\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
The SCSI control block structure is used to send a command to a
SCSI device.  The \f4scb\f1 contains a pointer to a command descriptor block
(CDB) that describes the command to the target controller.
The CDB command
information is created using either the \f4scm\f1 structure or the
\f4scs\f1 structure, both described on \f4scm\f1(D4I).
The CDB contains the operation code of the instruction you
wish to send and other command-specific data.
.P
The method of using the \f4scb\f1 structure is:
.RS 3n
.IP 1 4n
Fill in the appropriate information in the CDB, put the address of the CDB
in the \f4sc_cmdpt\f1 member of the \f4scb\f1 structure, and set
\f4sc_cmdsz\f1.
.IP 2
Set the \f4sb_type\f1 member of the \f4sb\f1 structure to indicate whether
this structure is being used by \f4sdi_icmd\f1(D3I) or by \f4sdi_send\f1(D3I).
.IP 3
Set the \f4sc_link\f1 member of the \f4scb\f1 structure to \f4NULL\fP.
.IP 4
Set the \f4sc_datapt\f1 member of the \f4scb\f1 structure to the virtual
address of the data area, and set \f4sc_datasz\f1.
Always assign values
to \f4sc_datapt\f1 and \f4sc_datasz\f1 if the command requires a data area.
You must set these two fields to \f4NULL\fP.
.IP 5
Call \f4sdi_translate\f1(D3I) to resolve virtual to physical addressing.
Before calling this function, these fields must be set:
\f4sb_type\f1,
\f4sc_cmdpt\f1,
\f4sc_cmdsz\f1,
\f4sc_datapt\f1,
\f4sc_datasz\f1,
and
\f4sc_link\f1.
.IP 6
Call either \f4sdi_send\f1 or \f4sdi_icmd\f1 to send the CDB to the
SCSI device.
.RE
.P
On successful job completion, \f4sc_comp_code\f1 is set to \f4SDI_ASW\fP (all seems
well).
.P
For an error condition, check \f4sc_comp_code\f1 for \f4SDI_CKSTAT\fP, then check
\f4sc_status\f1 to determine the type of error that was returned by the target
controller.  (When an error occurs on a SCSI device, the error is passed to the
controller and then through the firmware of the host adapter.  SDI
acknowledges this interaction and sets the error code from the target
controller in \f4sc_status\f1 and sets \f4sc_comp_code\f1 to \f4SDI_CKSTAT\fP.)
.P
If \f4sc_comp_code\f1 is not \f4SDI_CKSTAT\fP or \f4SDI_ASW\fP, then the value in bits 0\-27
of \f4sc_comp_code\f1 indicates the nature of the error and the value in bits
28\-31 indicates how to process the error.
As an alternative, you may
wish to check bits 28\-31 for \f4SDI_ERROR\fP and then test bits 0\-27 for more
specific information.  A scenario for this usage is shown in the explanation
for \f4sc_comp_code\f1 later in this section.

.P
The fields that the host adapter can change are: \f4sc_comp_code\f1,
\f4sc_status\f1, and \f4sc_time\f1.
.P
More information on each member of the \f4scb\f1 structure follows:
.TP 15n
\f4sc_comp_code\f1
the job completion status.  This member is tested in the interrupt routine
after the job has completed.  Use \f4sc_comp_code\f1 by testing for
\f4SDI_ASW\fP (normal return).  If \f4SDI_ASW\fP is not present, test 
bits 28\-31 to determine if \f4SDI_ERROR\fP was set to indicate an error occurred.
The remaining values in bits 28\-31 indicate how to process the error.
The values for bits 28\-31 are covered in the following text.  Values for bits
0\-27 are covered at the end of the \f4scb\f1 structure section.  Refer to the
header file for more information on how to extract the values in each bit
position.  Values for bits 28\-31 are:
.RS 18n
.TP 15n
\f4SDI_ERROR\fP
An error occurred.
.TP
\f4SDI_RETRY\fP
The error is unrelated to this job and the job should be retried (device
dependent).
.TP
\f4SDI_MESS\fP
A message describing this event has been printed on the console and logged.
.TP
\f4SDI_SUSPEND\fP
The host adapter has suspended sending normal commands to the logical unit and
the target driver is responsible for resuming the queue.
Immediate commands can still be sent with the \f4sdi_icmd\f1 function, but the
SCSI device cannot be opened for pass-through.
.RE
.TP 15n
\f4sc_int\f1
a pointer to a target driver interrupt routine.  This routine is called 
when the job associated with the SCSI Control Block completes.  The interrupt
routine is called with a single 
argument which is a pointer to the address of the \f4sb\f1 of the job.
The interrupt routine runs at the SCSI interrupt level (12).  The functions in
the interrupt routine must not call \f4sleep\f1(D3K), have user context, or
run in the context of any particular process.  \f4sc_int\f1 is called when
the job sending the information to the SCSI device completes.
If \f4sc_int\f1 is \f4NULL\fP, no interrupt routine is called when the job
completes.
.TP
\f4sc_cmdpt\f1
a virtual address pointing
to the start of a target controller command with the size
indicated by the \f4sc_cmdsz\f1 member.  The SCSI command pointed at by
\f4sc_cmdpt\f1 is sent with no interpretation by the SDI software.
The command area must be in kernel space and contiguous in physical memory.
You must allocate your own data structure to ensure contiguous physical memory.
.TP
\f4sc_datapt\f1
a virtual address pointer pointing to the
start of the data area for the given command with the size indicated by
the \f4sc_datasz\f1 member.
.TP
\f4sc_wd\f1
provided for use by the target drivers.  This
member is not examined or changed by SDI; you can use this member for 
any purpose.
.TP
\f4sc_time\f1
\f4sc_time\f1 is the maximum number of milliseconds SDI
should wait for the job to complete.  The timing begins when
the command is sent to the controller. The completion status
must be returned before the timer runs out.  If a time out occurs,
the processing of queued 
jobs for that controller is suspended until it is resumed by the
target driver.  If the \f4sc_time\f1 member is zero, the job is not timed.
This timing should only be used 
to ensure the completion of the job and not for performance
measurements.
The returned value of \f4sc_time\f1 indicates the actual
amount of time that the job took and the resolution is in minutes.
.TP
\f4sc_dev\f1
SCSI device address (an instance of the \f4scsi_ad\f1(D4I) structure).
.TP
\f4sc_mode\f1
(not supported)  This member is
any special modes for this job.  The \f4SCB_HAAD\f1 bit in the \f4sc_mode\f1 field
refers to the data address which is pointed to by the \f4sc_datapt\f1 element.
If the \f4SCB_HAAD\f1 bit is set in the \f4sc_mode\f1
field, then the data address was supplied by SDI, 
otherwise it was supplied by the target driver.
.IP
When \f4SCB_PARTBLK\f1 is set in the mode field, it should indicate  that the
data area does not define the complete transfer.  In this case the
\f4sc_resid\f1 field indicates how many more bytes to expect in the
transfer.  These extra bytes are not transferred between system
memory and the SCSI bus.  If the transfer is a write, zeros are
sent to the controller.
.TP
\f4sc_status\f1
contains the value returned by the target controller.  If a
.SM "CHECK CONDITION"
status is returned, the host adapter suspends processing
of commands to that device.  (\c
.SM "CHECK CONDITION"
is defined in the
\f2AT&T SCSI Definition\f1, Select Code 305-013.)
.TP
\f4sc_fill\f1
(not supported)   A character with which an incomplete data block is padded.
All incomplete data blocks are always padded with zeros.
.TP
\f4sc_link\f1
(not supported)  You must set this member to \f4NULL\fP before calling
\f4sdi_translate\f1.
.TP
\f4sc_cmdsz\f1
command size in bytes.
.TP
\f4sc_datasz\f1
data size in bytes of the requested input or output buffer.
.TP
\f4sc_resid\f1
(not supported)  The number of bytes not transferred
to/from the target controller.  This is used for partial block transfers.
Residue bytes which are received from the target controller are discarded by
SDI.
.SS "Completion Codes"
The following table is an alphabetic list of the values that may be returned in the \f4sc_comp_code\fP
field of the \f4scp\fP structure.
The third column
indicates the hexadecimal value associated with the completion code value.  The
fourth column indicates on which computer type the use of the completion code
is supported.  The fifth column describes which flags in bit positions 28\-31
of \f4sc_comp_code\f1 are enabled by the completion code.  (E is \f4SDI_ERROR\fP, M
is \f4SDI_MESS\fP, R is \f4SDI_RETRY\fP, S is \f4SDI_SUSPEND\fP, and ``-'' indicates that the
respective flag is not enabled.)

.ne 5
The \f4sc_comp_code\f1 values are defined as follows:
.TP 16n
\f4SDI_SCBERR\fP
The SCSI control block contains an error or an invalid type.
.TP
\f4SDI_ASW\fP
All seems well.  The job completed without an error.
.TP
\f4SDI_CKSTAT\fP
Check the status byte.  This value is set
when the target controller returns a status other than good.
.TP
\f4SDI_HAERR\fP
A problem occurred between SDI and
the host adapter controller.  Possible causes are I/O bus parity
or a failed host adapter.
.TP
\f4SDI_NOALLOC\fP
The requested block was not allocated to a target driver by SDI.  If a
target driver detects this value, panic the system (using the 
\f4cmn_err\f1(D3P) function).  \f4sc_comp_code\f1 is set to this value when
the SCSI block is released from the target driver.
.TP
\f4SDI_NOSELE\fP
SDI timed out trying to select the controller.
.TP
\f4SDI_ONEIC\fP
More than one immediate request has been sent.
.TP
\f4SDI_OOS\fP
The firmware is not
operational.
.TP
\f4SDI_PROGRES\fP
The job is not complete (set by SDI in
the \f4sdi_icmd\f1 and \f4sdi_send\f1 functions)
.TP
\f4SDI_QFLUSH\fP
When the target driver requested a job queue flush for a device, all jobs in
the queue are returned with this completion code set.
.TP
\f4SDI_RESET\fP
SDI detected a reset on the SCSI bus.
All outstanding or jobs queued at the target controller are returned to the
target drivers with this condition code set.  If the job is being controlled by
SDI, but has not been sent out on the bus, the job is not returned.
This code is also returned if a
target driver requests that a target controller be reset.
.TP
\f4SDI_SFBERR\fP
There is an error in one of the fields in the \f4sfb\f1
structure.
.TP
\f4SDI_TIME\fP
SDI timed out a job.
.TP
\f4SDI_UNUSED\fP
The host adapter is not 
using the control structure.  SDI sets the
\f4sc_comp_code\f1 to this value when it allocates a SCSI block for a
target driver.
.P
The following values are listed in \f4sdi.h\f1 but are not supported at this time.
.TP 16n
\f4SDI_LINKF0\fP
This linked command completed normally and the SCSI command value
bit was zero.
.TP
\f4SDI_LINKF1\fP
This linked command completed normally and the SCSI command value
bit was one.
.TP
\f4SDI_MISMAT\fP
A controller attempted to perform an operation that did not
agree with the data supplied in the SCB.  For example, this error can occur
when the controller attempts to transfer data in and the \f4SCB_READ\fP value is not
set in the \f4sc_mode\f1 member.
.TP
\f4SDI_SBUSER\fP
The host adapter encountered a problem on the SCSI bus
and all recovery action failed.  A controller with a faulty bus
driver can cause such an error.
TP
\f4SDI_TCERR\fP
The host adapter detected a protocol error while performing this
request.
.SH NOTES
After the \f4scb\f1 is sent, do not change the information in this structure 
or anything referenced by it (for example, in the structure that describes the
CDB) until after the job completes.

.SH NAME
\f4scm\fP, \f4scs\fP \- SCSI command structures
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4#include <sys/scsi.h>\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
Both the \f4scm\f1 and \f4scs\f1 structures are used by target drivers and 
with the pass-through
interface to send a SCSI command to a SCSI device.  The \f4scs\f1 structure
defines the layout for a group 6 (six-byte command length) command descriptor
block (CDB); \f4scm\f1 is a group 10 (ten-byte command length) CDB.  Both
types of CDBs are described 
in the 
\f2ANSI Small Computer System Interface (SCSI), X3T9.2/82-2,
Revision 17B\f1, December 16, 1985.
Refer to the ANSI manual for more information on
individual structure members.  The \f4sm_pad0\f1 member ensures that the
\f4sm_addr\f1 member does not cross a 32-bit word boundary.
.SH STRUCTURE MEMBERS
The members of the \f4scm\f1 structure are:
.P
.RS 3n
.ft 4
.nf
int       sm_pad0 : 16;   /* 16-bit pad */
int       sm_op   : 8;    /* Opcode */
int       sm_lun  : 3;    /* Logical unit number */
int       sm_res1 : 5;    /* reserved field */
unsigned  sm_addr;        /* Block address */
int       sm_res2 : 8;    /* reserved field */
int       sm_len  : 16;   /* Transfer length */
int       sm_cont : 8;    /* Control byte */

.P
Because of the \f4sm_pad0\f1 member, you must add 2 to the address of
the \f4scm\f1 structure when specifying it in the \f4scb\f1 structure.

The members of the \f4scs\f1 structure are:

int       ss_op   : 8;    /* Opcode */
int       ss_lun  : 3;    /* Logical unit number */

int       ss_len  : 8;    /* Transfer length */

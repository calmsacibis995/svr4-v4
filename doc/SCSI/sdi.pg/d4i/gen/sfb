.SH NAME
\f4sfb\fP \- SCSI function block structure
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4#include <sys/sdi.h>\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
The SCSI function block serves as a mechanism for sending control information
from a target driver to the host adapter or to a SCSI device.  (The
\f4scb\f1(D4I)
is sent to the device, the \f4sfb\f1 is generally sent to all other receiving
entities.)
.P
An \f4sfb\f1 is sent to the device when an abort or reset message is
required.  (Abort and reset messages have a different protocol than do the
commands sent to the SCSI device with a CDB.)
.SH STRUCTURE MEMBERS
.ft 4
.nf
unsigned long   sf_comp_code;   /* Current job status */
void            (*sf_int)();    /* Target driver intr handler */
struct scsi_ad  sf_dev;         /* SCSI device address */
unsigned long   sf_func;        /* Function to be performed */
int             sf_wd           /* Target driver word */

.P
The \f4sf_comp_code\f1 is identical to the \f4sc_comp_code\f1 in the
\f4scb\f1, and it takes on the same values; see \f4scb\f1(D4I).
.P
The \f4sf_int\f1 and \f4sf_dev\f1 entries are used the same as in
the \f4scb\f1 structure.  The only field which the host adapter changes
in the \f4sfb\f1 structure is \f4sf_comp_code\f1.
.P
The \f4sf_func\f1 member indicates the operation to be performed:
.RS 3n
.TP 16n
\f4SFB_ABORTM\fP
Send an abort message to the addressed logical unit.
.TP
\f4SFB_FLUSHR\fP
Flush a logical queue unit.
.TP
\f4SFB_NOPF\fP
The target driver is not to perform an operation.
.TP
\f4SFB_RESETM\fP
Send a bus device reset message to the
addressed controller.
.TP
\f4SFB_RESUME\fP
Permit normal job flow to a logical unit.
This command is used after \f4SFB_SUSPEND\fP, but no error results if \f4SFB_RESUME\fP is
called first.
.TP
\f4SFB_SUSPEND\fP
Suspend a queue.  This indicates 
that normal job flow to the logical unit is halted until the queue is 
resumed by the target driver.

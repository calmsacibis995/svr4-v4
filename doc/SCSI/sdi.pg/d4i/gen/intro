.SH NAME
\f4intro\fP \- introduction to SCSI data structures
.SH DESCRIPTION
This section describes the structures that are
accessed in SCSI target drivers.
Five data structures are used by SDI to handle data transmission between the
target drivers and the SCSI host adapter.  Additional structures, the
\f4scm\f1 and the \f4scs\f1 structures, are used to
send a command from a user program to a SCSI device 
using the pass-through interface.
.P
The structures discussed in this section are:
.IP
\f4sb\f1 SCSI block structure
.IP
\f4scb\f1 SCSI control block structure
.IP
\f4scm\f1 and \f4scs\f1 SCSI command structures
.IP
\f4scsi_ad\f1 SCSI device address structure
.IP
\f4sfb\f1 SCSI function block structure
.IP
\f4ver_no\f1 SCSI version number structure

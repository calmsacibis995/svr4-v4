.BK "USL Documentation Style Guide"
.CH "USL Documentation Style Guide"
.H 1 "Introduction"
This is a set of guidelines
on style for
\*U System Laboratories
documentation.
These guidelines apply to all
types of documents, including
the reference manuals,
except where explicitly noted.
Much of our house style relies
on the following other works:
.BL
.LI
Except as noted in this
.BT "Style Guide,"
we aim to conform to the stylistic rules set out in
.BT "The Chicago Manual of Style"
(Thirteenth Edition).
.LI
For good advice about writing style,
we recommend
.BT "The Elements of Style"
by Strunk and White.
.LI
Except as noted in this
.BT "Style Guide,"
we use
.BT "Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary"
as the final arbiter on spelling.
.LI
For text entry, formatting, typographical
details, and indexing, we follow the
.BT "Documenter's Tool Set User's Guide,"
Release 1.0.
We'll refer to this guide as the
.BT "\s-1DOCTOOLS\s0 User's Guide."
.LE
.P
This is the first issue of the
.BT "Style Guide" ";"
until now,
writers in the USL documentation groups
have worked without the guidelines presented here.
Thus the USL documentation set
does not yet conform, entirely,
to the rules set forth in the
.BT "Style Guide" "."
When you find stylistic inconsistencies in our books,
look to the
.BT "Style Guide"
to find out which style is correct.
Eventually, we will remove these inconsistencies.
.P
We recognize that this
.BT "Style Guide"
does not cover every matter of style that
deserves to be addressed.
We intend to expand and change the
.BT "Style Guide"
in accordance with writers' needs.
.H 1 "Writing Style"
.H 2 "Addressing the Reader"
.BL
.LI
Use an informal but precise tone.
.IX tone
Speak fluidly and directly, expecting
readers to scan the text, skipping sections.
Use contractions.
.IX contractions
.LI
Use ``we'' and ``you'' instead of third person nouns when addressing the reader.
.IX person
.VL .75i .5i
.LI "Wrong:"
.SM USL
recommends . . . 
.LI "Right:"
We recommend . . . 
.LI "Wrong:"
The user can create a new password . . . 
.LI "Right:"
You can create a new password . . . 
.LE
.LI
Use ``must'' only when necessary.
.VL .75i .5i
.LI "Wrong:"
You must start by familiarizing yourself with
the terms explained in the following section.
(Here the use of ``must'' is inappropriate because
the reader does not have to follow this step.)
.LI "Right:"
First become familiar with
the terms explained in the following section.
.LI "Right:"
You must first install the
.SM XYZ
Utilities.
(Here the use of ``must'' is appropriate because
the software does not work if this step is not followed.)
.LE
.LE
.H 2 "Tense, Mood, and Voice"
.BL
.LI
Use the present tense whenever you can.
.IX tense (of verbs)
.LI
Use the imperative mood for instructions
and the indicative mood for all other situations,
including hypothetical ones.
.IX mood (of verbs)
.VL .75i .5i
.LI "Wrong:"
If you forgot the firmware password,
you could assign a new one with the floppy key.
.LI "Right:"
If you forget the firmware password,
assign a new one with the floppy key.
.LE
.LI
Use the active voice.
.IX voice
.IX passive voice
.LE
.H 2 "Sexist Language"
.IX istart sexist language
Reword text whenever necessary to avoid any reference
to a person's sex.
For example:
.BL
.LI
Use the second (not the third) person.
.VL .75i 
.LI "Wrong:"
The administrator should warn users before he
shuts down the system.
.LI "Right:"
Warn users before you shut down the system.
.LE
.LI
Use a plural (not a singular) pronoun.
.VL .75i 
.LI "Wrong:"
The administrator is responsible for 
supporting the users on her system.
.LI "Right:"
Administrators are responsible for 
supporting the users on their systems.
.LE
.LI
Use job titles (not pronouns).
.VL .75i
.LI "Wrong:"
He issues the system password.
.LI "Right:"
The administrator issues the system password.
.LE
.LI
Use the definite article (``the'')
instead of a possessive article ( ``his'' or ``her'').
.VL .75i
.LI "Wrong:"
The administrator should monitor the installation 
of this package on her system.
.LI "Right:"
The administrator should monitor the installation 
of this package on the system.
.LE
.LI
If you can't use any of the above forms of wording, 
use the passive (instead of the active) voice.
This is the least desirable alternative.
.VL .75i
.LI "Wrong:"
He should run a full backup once a week.
.LI "Right:"
A full backup should be run once a week.
.LE
.LE
.IX iend sexist language
.H 2 "Emphasis"
.IX emphasis
.BL
.LI
If you need to emphasize some information,
use the admonishment macro to create a note
(see ``Notes and Admonishments''):
.AB N
Never use the
.UI "rm *"
command in your home directory.
.AC
.LI
To add emphasis where an admonishment is invalid, as on the manual pages,
or inappropriate in some other way, use structural 
rather than typographical devices.
.VL .75i
.LI "Wrong:"
You \f3may not\fP change this field.
.LI "Wrong:"
You \f2may not\fP change this field.
.LI "Wrong:"
You MAY NOT change this field.
.LI "Right:"
Do not change this field; if you do,
you may lose data necessary for the xyz procedure,
described later in this section.
.LE
.LE
.H 2 "Use of ``That'' and ``Which''"
.IX ``that,'' use of
.IX ``which,'' use of
Use ``that'' to introduce restrictive clauses
and ``which'' to introduce nonrestrictive clauses.
.H 5 "Restrictive"
Here is an example of a restrictive clause:
.DS I "" F
The old books that came from Italy are fascinating.
.DE
The restrictive clause limits the books being discussed 
to those books that came from Italy.
This sentence implies that not all of the old books 
being discussed came from Italy.
There may be others from other places;
they may or may not be fascinating.
.H 5 "Non-restrictive"
Here is an example of a non-restrictive clause:
.DS I "" F
The old books, which came from Italy, are fascinating.
.DE
A restrictive clause is not needed
because the meaning of the sentence remains the same
whether or not the clause is included.
To show that the clause could be omitted from
the sentence without changing the meaning,
set it off with commas, as shown above.
For example, the above
sentence states that all the old books are
fascinating; the phrase ``came from Italy'' is not
needed to show which books are being discussed.
The implication is that all the old books came from Italy.
.P
The conjunction ``that'' is frequently used
unnecessarily.
Omit needless occurrences of ``that.''
For example:
.VL .75i .5i
.LI "Wrong:"
Add a login for each user that you've added to the system.
.LI "Right:"
Add a login for each user you've added to the system.
.LE
.H 1 "Rules for Entering Text"
The rules in this section apply only to the input
for source text files.
.BL
.LI
Start every sentence in an input file on a new line.
This convention makes the source easier to maintain.
.LI
Do not leave blank spaces at the end of a line.
They can produce inappropriate horizontal spacing.
.LI
Do not request fonts by name;
that is, do not use requests such as
.IX fonts
.UI \efI ,
.UI \efB ,
or
.UI \ef(HB .
Request fonts only by number, as described in
.ST "Markup for Computer Text."
.LI
Do not request page breaks in document source
(for example, to fix widows)
until you are ready to produce camera-ready copy.
.IX page breaks
.IX break (page)
.IX widows
When you do insert page breaks, use the
.UI .NE
macro.
Never use the
.UI .SK
macro or the
.UI .bp
request.
See the
.ST "Production"
section for details.
.LI
Do not add
.UI .sp
requests to your files
as a means of producing vertical space; the
.UI format
macros leave the appropriate amount of space.
.P
Do not add blank lines to your files except to
represent a literal blank line\(emthat is, a blank line
in user input or computer output
(for example, in a screen).
.LE
.H 2 "Changing Fonts"
.IX fonts
When you change fonts inside a text element
such as an admonishment or a legend, use
.IX legends, fonts in
.IX captions (see legends)
.UI \efP
to return to the default font.
Font 1 may be the wrong font.
For example:
.VL .75i .25i
.LI "Wrong:"
\f4\&.FG "Example of \ef4sag\ef1 Output"\fP
.LI "Right:"
\f4\&.FG "Example of \ef4sag\efP Output"\fP
.LE
.H 2 "Document-Specific Strings"
.IX strings (\f4troff\fP)
To help make documents consistent and to avoid repeated typing of long strings
(such as the full name of a product or document), define
.UI troff
strings and use them in place of the full name:
.DS I UI
\&.ds Pr \ef2Programmer's Reference Manual\efP
\&.ds Ur \ef2User's Reference Manual\efP
\& . . .
The most frequently used commands
are described in the \e*(Pr and the \e*(Ur.
\& . . .
.DE
.H 2 "Escaping troff Special Characters"
.IX special characters (\f4troff\fP)
A dot or a single quote at the beginning of a line in an input file is a
.UI troff
special character indicating
that the line contains a request or macro rather than ordinary input text.
In some contexts (for example, admonishments or tables)
.UI troff
can interpret a dot or a quote as a special character even though
it is not the first character in a line in the input file.
To avoid such misinterpretation,
escape all words that begin with a dot or a single quote with the ``\c
.UI \e& ''
special character, a ``zero-width, non-printing'' character.
For example:
.DS I UI
The format of the
\&.UI \e&.hw
request is as follows:
\&.DS I UI
\e&.hw \ef2word1 word2\ef1 . . .
\&.DE
.DE
.H 2 "Hyphenation"
.IX hyphenation
.BL
.LI
When \f4troff\fP hyphenates incorrectly,
you can override it using the
.UI .hw
request.
The format of the
.UI .hw
request is as follows:
.DS I UI
\&.hw \f2word1 word2\f1 . . .
.DE
The arguments
.SB word1 ,
.SB word2 ", . . . "
specify permissible places for hyphens.
Mark each permissible place with the ``\f4-\fP'' character.
For example:
.DS I UI
\&.hw run-nable no-good-nik
.DE
.LI
To avoid hyphenation
.BL
.LI
To prevent
.UI troff
from hyphenating a word anywhere in the document, use the
.UI .hw
request with no hyphens in the word.
.LI
To prevent
.UI troff
from hyphenating a single instance of a word, precede the word
(and any font changes to it) with the ``\f4\e%\fP'' request.
.LE
.LE
.H 2 "Long Headings"
If a \f4.H 1\fP heading is too long
to appear as a page header,
use the second argument (to
.UI ".H 1" ")"
to supply an abbreviated form of the heading
to be used in the running header.
For example:
.VL 1.2i .2i
.LI "Full header:"
``Browsing Resources with the dfshares Command''
.LI "Abbreviation:"
``Browsing with dfshares''
.LE
.H 1 "Lists"
.IX istart lists
.BL
.LI
Use numbered (\f4.AL\fP) lists
only when the sequence of list items is important.
.IX numbered lists
.LI
Use bulleted (\f4.BL\fP),
variable (\f4.VL\fP),
and dashed (\f4.DL\fP) lists
when the sequence of list items is unimportant.
.IX bullet lists
.IX variable lists
.IX dashed lists
.LI
Use variable (\f4.VL\fP) lists
for items that can be divided into two sections:
.IX variable lists
a tag word (or phrase)
and a line or more of explanatory text.
For example:
.VL .75i .5i
.LI "Height"
6'4''
.LI "Weight"
112 lb.
.LI "Hobbies"
pachinko, contra dancing, jackalope hunting
.LE
.LI
You may nest lists up to three levels deep.
Within a book, use a consistent nesting style.
Use dashed lists (produced by \f4.DL\fP)
rather than bullet lists (produced by \f4.BL\fP)
at the third level.
Numbered lists (\f4.AL\fP) and variable lists (\f4.VL\fP)
may be used at any level.
.IX nested lists
.LI
To make lists simple and list items parallel,
avoid mixing sentences and non-sentences in a list.
.LI
For list items, use the following rules of punctuation and capitalization:
.IX punctuation, of lists
.BL
.LI
If a list is made up entirely of sentences,
capitalize and punctuate list items as you would ordinary running text.
.LI
If a list is made up entirely of non-sentences,
do not capitalize the first word in the list items or use any punctuation
at the end of any list item.
Within a list item, use internal punctuation (such as commas) as necessary.
.LI
If a list contains at least one sentence
plus other items that are not sentences,
capitalize the first word of
all list items but end a list item with final punctuation
(such as a period) only if it is a sentence.
Do not end individual list items with internal punctuation
(such as commas or semicolons) or conjunctions
(such as ``and'' or ``or'').
Within a list item, use internal punctuation (such as commas)
as necessary.
.LI
If a list item consists of a phrase followed by a sentence,
separate the two pieces of text with
an em dash;
do not put a period after the phrase.
.LE
.LE
.IX iend lists
.H 1 "Punctuation"
.IX istart punctuation
.H 2 "Dashes, Hyphens, and Minus Signs"
.IX istart dashes
.BL
.LI
Use a hyphen
for compound terms such as ``read-only.''
.IX hyphen
To produce a hyphen, type the following:
.UI -
.LI
Use an en dash
.IX en dash
or a minus sign
to show a range of numbers or other symbols (such as ``1\(en5'').
To produce an en dash, use the
.UI \e(en
request.
To produce a minus sign, enter \f4\e-\fP.
Do not leave white space between an en dash
(or minus sign) and the words around it.
.LI
Use an em dash
as sentence punctuation\(emfor
.IX em dash
example, to isolate
a parenthetical remark.
Do not leave white space between
an em dash and the words around it.
Do not put an em dash at the beginning or end
of a text input line.
To produce an em dash, use the
.UI \e(em
request.
.LI
Use a minus sign
.IX minus sign
to mark options to commands
(such as
.UI "ps \-e" )
and to show mathematical expressions
(such as 1 \- 5 = \-4),
and in the
.ST \s-1NAME\s0
section of manual pages.

.H 2 "Ellipses"
.IX istart ellipses
.BL
.LI
To print an ellipsis,
use the string ``\f4. . .\fP''
(three periods separated by spaces).
Print the string in font 1.
Leave one space before the first period
and one space after the third,
regardless of whether
the preceding or following material
forms a sentence.
(If you're putting an ellipsis after a sentence,
omit the period that ordinarily ends the sentence.)
Here are some input examples:
.BL
.LI
.UI "This . . . is the simplest case."
.LI
.UI "Here is a list: item 1, item 2, . . ."
.LI
.UI "We need an ellipsis at the end of this sentence . . . This is the sentence following the ellipsis."
.LI
.UI "Use"

.BL
.LI
Within a list item, use internal punctuation
(such as commas)
as necessary.
.LI
Do not add internal punctuation
(such as commas or semicolons)
or conjunctions
(such as ``and'' and ``or'')
to the end of individual list items.
.LE
.H 2 "Parentheses"
.IX parentheses, nesting
Don't nest parentheses.
Avoid nesting by putting parentheses
between square brackets as in the following:
.VL .75i .5i
.LI "Input:"
.UI ". . . after you pack the files [see \ef4cpio\ef1(1)]."
.LI "Output:"
\&. . . after you pack the files [see \f4cpio\f1(1)].
.LE
.H 2 "Punctuation after Literal I/O in Running Text"
Do not use punctuation that can be confused with characters to be typed by the user.
If necessary,
reword a sentence:
.VL .75i .5i
.LI "Wrong:"
Enter the following command: \f4rm *\f1.
.LI "Right:"
Enter \f4rm *\f1 to remove all files in the current directory.
.LE
.H 2 "Quotation Marks"
.BL
.LI
To produce quotation marks in running text,
type two back quotes (\f4``\f1) and two forward quotes (\f4''\f1);
.IX quotation marks
do not use the double quote key (\f4"\f1).
Here are some cases when quotes are appropriate:
.BL
.LI
Use quotation marks around chapter and section titles.
In guides, the
.UI .CT
and
.UI .ST
macros supply the quotes.
In reference manuals, you must supply them:
.VL .75i .5i
.LI "Input:"
.UI "See the chapter ``Shell Tutorial.''"
.LI "Output:"
See the chapter ``Shell Tutorial.''
.LE
.LI
Use quotation marks around literal
.SM I/O
of one character (or around other short expressions) when the quotes
help clarify the text.
For example:
.VL .75i .5i
.LI "Input:"
.UI "``\ef4?\efP'' is a special character."
.LI "Output:"
``\f4?\fP'' is a special character.
.LE
.LI
Use quotation marks around a word
used as a word: that is,
a word used to refer to a word itself,
rather than to the thing
represented by the word.
For example:
.DL
.LI
Tables are on sale in the furniture department.
.LI
``Tables'' is a six-letter word.
.LE
.LE
.LI
Don't use quotation marks for emphasis, irony, or slang.
.IX emphasis
.IX irony
.IX slang
.LI
Use the double quote key
(\f4"\f1) to delimit arguments to
.UI troff
macros and to represent a double quote in computer text:
.DS I UI
\&.H 1 "How to Send Mail"
Enter the following command:
\&.DS I UI
mailx -s "test mail" fred
\&.DE
.DE
.LI
Put periods and commas before closing quotation marks;
put all other punctuation
(semi-colons, colons, question marks, exclamation points,
and so on) after quotation marks.
For example:
.VL .75i .25i
.LI "Input:"
\f4For details, see Chapter 1,
.br
\&.CT "Overview."\f1
.LI "Output:"
For details, see Chapter 1, ``Overview.''

For example:
.VL .75i .5i
.LI "Input:"
\f4\&.HK "!"\fP
.LI "Output:"
.HK "!"
.LE
.LI
In guides for advanced users and on manual pages:
The first time you mention an
.SM ASCII
graphic character,
spell out its name, followed by the character itself.
Show the character in font 4, in double quotes and parentheses.
For example:
.VL .75i .5i
.LI "Input:"
\f4Type an exclamation point (``\ef4!\efP'')
to end the edit session without writing the file.\fP
.LI "Output:"
Type an exclamation point (``\f4!\fP'')
to end the edit session without writing the file.
.LE
.P
For later references in the document
or in the current chapter (use your judgment),
show only the character in font 4 in double quotes;
don't spell out the name.
For example:
.VL .75i .5i
.LI "Input:"
\f4Use ``\ef4!\efP''
to end the edit session without writing the file.\fP
.LI "Output:"
Use ``\f4!\fP''

.LE

.LI
To show multi-character input
using the
.UI .HK
macro, use a separate call to
.UI .HK
for each character the terminal sends to the software.
Multi-character input is input in which more than one special character is sent to the software;
multi-character input is different from single-character input
for which you must press more than one key simultaneously.
The
.SM SHIFT
key and the
.SM CTRL
key are the primary examples of keys that do not by themselves send input;
you must press another key simultaneously to send one character.
For example, by pressing
.SM CTRL-SHIFT-D
you send only one character.
An example of multi-character input is
.HK F7
.HK d :
the function key sends one character
(or character sequence)
and the ``\f4d\fP'' sends another.

.AB N
The following two items describe our markup for user input and computer output.
Although we use different macros for these types of text,
both macros currently use the same font to produce their output.
By making the distinction in our source files, however,
we are making it possible
to make a typographical distinction in the future.
.AC
.BL
.LI
Literal user input
is any text typed by the user.
.IX user input
In guides, use the
.UI \&.UI
macro to mark user input in running text, displays, and lists.
In reference manuals and when it's not convenient to use the macro in the guides,
print user input using font 4.
.P
Examples of user input are
all shell input, including command names, option letters and words,
environment variables,
and filenames;
all elements of programming languages, including variable, function,
and structure names,
structure members, defined constants (such as the symbolic names of error numbers and signals),
keywords, preprocessor input,
and programs and program fragments;
and the names of manual pages.
.P
Always show user input (such as command names)
as they must be typed by the user.
Do not capitalize a command name (or any other string of
user input) that appears at the beginning of a sentence,
heading, or title.
.P
Use a legend for a display of user input if you want to refer to it later
or if you want the legend to appear in the table of contents.
Use the
.UI .FG
macro to produce the legend.
.IX legends, computer text
.LI
Literal computer output
is any text produced by the computer.
.IX computer output
In guides, use the
.UI \&.CO
macro to mark computer output in running text, displays, and lists.
In reference manuals and when it's not convenient to use the macro in the guides,
print computer output using font 5.
.P
Examples of computer output are diagnostics, error messages,
and program output.
.P
Always show computer output (such as menu prompts)
as they appear on the screen.
Do not capitalize a menu prompt (or any other string of
computer output) that appears at
the beginning of a sentence, heading, or title.
.P
Use a legend for a display of computer output if you want to refer to it later
or if you want the legend to appear in the table of contents.
Use the
.UI .FG
macro to produce the legend.
.LI
Substitutable text
is any text (showing user input) for which
.IX substitutable text
the reader is expected to substitute values
when entering that text as input.
For example, if the word ``file'' appears
in a sample command line,
the reader must replace it
with the name of an actual file
when entering that line.
.P
In guides, use the
.UI \&.SB
macro to mark substitutables in running text, displays, and lists.
In reference manuals and when it's not convenient to use the
.UI \&.SB
macro in the guides,
print substitutables using font 2.
.LI
Syntactic notation
.IX syntactic notation, font for
consists of symbols, such as brackets and ellipses,
that appear in a command synopsis
but that are not typed by a user.
Use font 1 for symbols such as these.
.LI
Print user input in font 4 and computer output in font 5 in all
contexts except book and chapter titles and section headings.
.IX titles, fonts in
.IX headings, fonts in
These font rules apply in figure and table legends,
indexes, and so on.
.IX legends, fonts in
.IX fonts
.LI
In guides for beginning users, you may include shell prompts
at the beginning of command lines shown in displays.
Use default prompts:
the dollar sign (``\f4$\fP'') is the default prompt for ordinary users;
the pound sign (``\f4#\fP'') is the default prompt for login
.UI root .
If you include prompts in your examples,
be consistent: show prompts
in front of all command lines in displays
throughout the book.
(In screen displays,
always show prompts that appear on the user's terminal screen.)
.LI
Treat filenames as user input.
.IX filenames
Mark them with
.UI .UI
or
print them in font 4.
Do not use angle brackets
around header file names in running text:
.VL .75i .25i
.LI "Wrong:"
These values are defined in
.UI <stdio.h> .
.LI "Right:"
These values are defined in
.UI stdio.h .
.LE
.LI
Treat environment variables as user input.
.IX environment variables
Mark them with
.UI \&.UI
or
print them in font 4.
Do not precede them with a dollar sign unless you are showing a string to be typed,
as in the following (output) example:
.DS +0.5i "" F
Enter
.UI "echo $PATH"
to see the value of your current
.UI "PATH"
variable.
.DE
.LI
Treat function names as user input.
.IX function, names
Mark them with
.UI \&.UI
or
print them in font 4.
Do not follow function names with empty parentheses.
.LI
The synopsis lines of commands
are often complex and require many shifts in fonts.
.IX synopsis lines
.IX istart command line markup and syntax
In those cases you may prefer to encode the specific font numbers.
The following sample synopsis line for the \f4cat\f1 command
shows the typefaces used for command syntax.
.VL .75i .5i
.LI "Input:"
\f4\ef4cat\ef1 [\ef4\e-etv\ef1] [\ef2file\ef1] . . .\f1
.LI "Output:"
\f4cat\f1 [\f4\-etv\f1] [\f2file\f1] . . .
.LE
.UI cat
and
.UI \-etv
are in font 4
because they are strings of literal I/O.
.SB file
is in font 2
because it is a substitutable.
The brackets and ellipsis are in font 1
because they are elements of syntactic notation.
.LI
To produce a backslash,
.IX backslash
enter ``\f4\ee\fP'' in your text file.

.DS I UI
ls \f1[\f4\-CFRabcdfgilmnopqrstux\f1] \f2file\f1 . . .
.DE
.LI
If the order of options is not significant,
list them in
.SM "ASCII"
order: (1) numerals,
(2) uppercase letters (in alphabetical order), and (3) lowercase letters
(in alphabetical order).
For example:
.DS I UI
ls \f1[\f4\-CFRabcdfgilmnopqrstux\f1] \f2file\f1 . . .
.DE
If the order of options is significant
(that is, if a command does not execute unless the options
to it are entered in a specific order),
show those options in the required order.
Also, be sure to warn the reader about the required order.
.LI
If an option requires an argument,
list each option, along with its arguments, in separate brackets:
.DS I
\f4nusend \-d \f2dest [\f4\-m\f1] \f1[\f4\-a \f2acct\f1]  [\f4\-n \f2netname\f1]
.DE
List required arguments, such as \f4\-d\ \f2dest\f1, first,
and don't use brackets around them.
.LI
If a command takes a complex set of options
or an option takes a complex set of arguments,
use a one-word abbreviation for the set in the synopsis
and explain the set in the text.
For example:
.DS I UI
\ef4cc\ef1 [\ef2options\ef1] \ef2file\ef1 . . .
.DE
.LI
If the options take mixed argument types,
first list together the options without arguments,
in brackets.
Then list the options that take separate arguments individually, as follows:
.DS I
\f4ps \f1[\f4\-acdefjl\f1] [\f4\-g \f2grplist\f1] [\f4\-p \f2proclist\f1] [\f4\-t \f2termlist\f1]
.DE
.LI
If options are mutually exclusive,
list them on separate lines.
This helps avoid a more complicated syntax
using vertical bars and curly braces.
.DS I
\f4at \f2time\f1 [\|\f2date\f1\|] [\|+\f2increment\f1\|]
\f4at \-r \f2job\f1 . . .
\f4at \-l \f1[\|\f2job\f1 . . . ]
.DE
.LI
When you describe options to a command,
show them in list format in the same order
in which they appear in the
.ST \s-1SYNOPSIS\s0
section of the manual page.
In guides, use the variable list (\f4.VL\fP) format;
in manuals, use a tagged paragraph
(\f4.TP\fP or \f4.IP\fP) format.
.LI
Whenever you refer to an option in running text,
precede it with a minus sign unless the minus sign is syntactically incorrect.

literal input in font 4, and so on.
.LI
Center headings of columns.
.LI
Use capitalization in row and column headings as you would in titles.
.LI
To separate headings from the body of the table,

avoid double rules.
.LI

.UI .TB ,
the table is labeled as a table and its legend appears in a list of tables
in the master table of contents for the book.
If you use

To show a line of code that's too long
.IX program listings
to fit on one line: (1) break the line
at syntactically appropriate points and
display it on multiple lines; or
(2) remove some white space from the beginning of the line,
indenting it less
(for example, by replacing a tab with two or three spaces).
.P
When you use the first method,
be sure to maintain the syntactical correctness
and the coding style of the example.
For instance, end a line of shell input with a backslash to continue the line;
in C, a newline is syntactically equivalent to other whitespace characters
such as space or tab, so you can break the line wherever a space or tab is valid.

In guides,
use the
.UI \&.BT ,
.UI \&.CT ,
and
.UI \&.ST
macros to refer to books, chapters, and sections.
If you want a comma or period
to appear immediately after
the title of a book, chapter, or section,
put it inside the double quotes used to specify
an argument to the \f4.BT\fP, \f4.CT\fP
or \f4.ST\fP macro.
For example:
.VL .75i .5i
.LI "Input:"
.ft 4
.nf
See Chapter 1,
\&.CT "An Overview of System Administration,"
in the
\&.BT "System Administrator's Guide."
.fi

.LI "Output:"
See Chapter 1,
.CT "An Overview of System Administration,"
in the
.BT "System Administrator's Guide."
.LE

In reference manuals,
print book titles in font 2;
precede chapter and section titles with two back quotes
and follow them with two single quotes:
.VL .75i .5i
.LI "Input:"
.ft 4
.nf
See Chapter 1,
``An Overview of System Administration,''
in the \ef2System Administrator's Guide\efP.

.LE
.LI
For markup purposes, we do not consider
product names (such as ``\*U System V'')
part of our document titles;
when a product name precedes a book title
it should appear in the regular font (font 1).
For example:
.VL .75i .5i
.LI "Input:"
\f4UNIX System V
.br
\&.BT "System Administrator's Guide"\f1
.LI "Input:"
\f4UNIX System V \ef2System Administrator's Guide\ef1\f1
.LI "Output:"
UNIX System V
.BT "System Administrator's Guide"
.LE
There's no need to include the product name
before the book title
unless its omission might cause confusion.
For example, the
document sets for two products, \*U
System V and
.SM "DOCUMENTER'S WORKBENCH" \(rg
(\s-1DWB\s0),
both include a book called
.BT "User's Guide."
If you want the text in the
.BT "User's Guide"
for the \*U System V document set
to include a reference to the
.BT "User's Guide"
for the
.SM DWB
document set, include the product title:
``Documenter's Workbench \f2User's Guide\fP.''
.LI
To refer to a reference manual page,
include the appropriate section number
.IX manual page reference
(in regular font) in parentheses, after the name of the page.
Once you've provided the section number for a manual page,
you need not include that number
in later references
as long as it's clear that you're still referring to the same page.

To refer to a software component
(command, function, system call,
library routine, and so on)
.IX command references
.IX function, references
.IX system call references
in documents for beginners and in ambiguous contexts,
specify the type of a component
(that is, whether it is a command, function, system call,
or other type of component).
.P
For example, in a book for new users
avoid sentences such as ``Run
.UI cat
to concatenate files.''
Instead, identify the component type of
.UI cat ,
as follows:
``Run the
.UI cat
command to concatenate files.''
.P
Sometimes, specifying component types prevents ambiguity:
``The
.UI "mkdir"
command calls the
.UI "mkdir"
system call.''
.P
In some contexts, the type of the component is clear
without being mentioned explicitly.
For example, in a discussion of a shell script, the following reference
is clearly to the command rather than the system call:
``The script calls
.UI time
to print execution times for the command.''
.LI
It is sometimes convenient to refer simultaneously
to a manual page and the software component it documents.
Except in documents for beginners, where it might be unfamiliar,
the following type of shorthand reference is clear:
``Use
.UI memcntl (2)
to lock the address space of a process.''

When you refer to the \*U system,
avoid references to specific releases whenever you can.
.IX UNIX, references to releases of

.P
If you must refer to a particular \*U system release, spell out the full name, such as
``\*U System V Release 4,'' in the first reference in a chapter or manual page.
In later references you may use only
the release number (such as ``Release 4'');
always try to make a reference as general as you can.
Avoid ``SVR\f2n\fP''
acronyms (such as ``SVR4'');
they are internal jargon and should not appear in customer documents.

Use the

macro to fix bad page breaks.
.IX page breaks
.IX break (page)
.IX widows
Because page breaks may change whenever document source changes,
do not fix page breaks until production time.
There is no need to fix them for reviews.
.P
The
.UI \&.NE
macro takes one argument, which specifies the amount of vertical space you need.
The argument may use any of the valid
.UI troff
scale indicators, but the most common indicators are vertical line spaces and inches.
To specify vertical line spaces, use
.UI \&.NE
followed by the number of lines you need.
To specify inches, use
.UI \&.NE
followed by the number of inches you need with the indicator ``\f4i\fP'' appended.
For example,
.UI ".NE 6"
means:
``At least six lines of text must be printed next;
if there's not enough room for six lines on this page
print all six lines at the top of the next page.''
.UI ".NE 1.25i"
means:
``1.25 inches of space are needed to print the next line;
if 1.25 inches of space are not available on this page,
print the following lines at the top of the next page.''
.P
Because using a
.UI ".NE"
macro is equivalent to hard-coding
a page break, keep in mind several
possible problems.
.BL
.LI
Make sure you enter the
.UI ".NE"
macro immediately before the first word of a line (in output).
If you don't, you might get only a partially full line of output.
To avoid this problem, put a
.UI ".NE"
macro immediately before or after a
.UI ".P"
macro.
.LI
As a rule of thumb, avoid specifying a number
more than five or six lines (or an equivalent amount
of space specified in inches) after the
.UI ".NE"
macro.
.P
By keeping the number of lines low,
you can ensure that even if the text before the
.UI ".NE"
macro is changed so that the
.UI ".NE"
invokes a page break at a higher line
(than the original line)
in a page of output,
an unusually large amount of white space is not
left at the bottom of a page.

.H 1 "Appendix: Style Guidelines for Release 4.1 Enhanced Security"
.IX istart Enhanced Security
This appendix contains style guidelines for Release 4.1 Enhanced Security.
This material is collected here for ease of reference as Release 4.1 ES
is first released;
it will eventually be incorporated into the main body of the
.BT "Style Guide" .
.P
This appendix is not an introduction to the features of Release 4.1 ES.
However, some understanding of those features is helpful in understanding this appendix;
see the
.BT "Product Overview".
.H 2 "Product Names"
.IX UNIX, references to releases of
For general information on referring to releases of \*U system software, see the
.ST "References"
section above.
In particular, avoid references to specific releases whenever you can.
.P
The full name of the new release is \*U System V Release 4.1 Enhanced Security.
If you must refer to this release, use its full name in the first reference
in a chapter or manual page;
on subsequent references you may use ``Release 4.1 ES.''
.P
``Release 4.1 Enhanced Security'' is a general term for the following
set of software products, each of which is separately licensable and installable:
.BL
.LI
The Enhanced Security Platform (sometimes called the ``base'') is the operating
system kernel, C language utilities, basic commands and libraries,
and several separately installable packages.
.LI
The Enhanced Security Utilities,
because they have the largest effect on document style,
are described in a separate section below.
.LI
The Auditing Utilities consist of several new commands
that allow administrators to keep records of certain operations,
who performed them, and when.
.LI
Enhanced Administration and Networking allows administrators to
perform tasks on remote machines.
.LE
.H 2 "Enhanced Security Utilities"
.IX security (see Enhanced Security)
.IX ES (see Enhanced Security)
.IX istart Enhanced Security, Enhanced Security Utilities
.H 3 "Overview"
The Enhanced Security Utilities, which may be installed and run on the
Enhanced Security Platform, include several new security features and options.
.P
Most separately installable packages allow administrators to
install entire commands\(ema command is either installed or it is not.
In contrast, the Enhanced Security Utilities allow administrators
to install modules called by many commands.
Moreover, these commands run differently depending on whether the
Enhanced Security Utilities are running.
ES modules affect many frequently used commands\(emfor example,
.UI chmod (1),
.UI lp (1),
.UI ls (1),
.UI ps "(1)\(emas well as many administrative commands."
.P
When software runs differently depending on whether the Enhanced Security Utilities are running,
say so in the documentation.
For example:
.DS I "" F
If the Enhanced Security Utilities are running and the file system
is of type \f4sfs\fP,
you may use an Access Control List (ACL) to exercise greater control over
file access than that allowed by file mode bits.
.DE
.H 3 "Access Permissions"
.IX istart superuser permissions
.IX istart privileges
.IX istart Enhanced Security, privileges
In \*U system releases before Release 4.1 ES, any user with user
.SM ID
0 (a ``superuser'') is allowed to perform any operation.
Traditionally, user
.UI root
has
.SM ID
0.
The terms ``\c
.UI root
permissions'' and
``superuser permissions''
were sometimes used interchangeably for this unlimited set of permissions.
.P
Release 4.1 ES allows more flexibility than is possible with the simple superuser model.
Following government specifications, Release 4.1 ES defines several administrative
roles, each with a separate user
.SM ID
and a separate set of default permissible operations.
These roles, and the checking of access permissions based on them,
operate only when the Enhanced Security Utilities are installed and running.
Therefore, when the Enhanced Security Utilities are running,
user
.SM ID
0 has a limited set of privileges.
When the Enhanced Security Utilities are not running,
user
.SM ID
0 has unlimited privileges, as before.
.P
At any security level, user
.SM ID
0 and user
.UI root
are valid; however, they have different permissions depending on whether
the Enhanced Security Utilities are running.
.P
To make our documents accurate whether or not the Enhanced Security Utilities
are running, we have replaced references to superuser privileges
and root privileges
with references to appropriate privileges.
For example:
.DS I "" F
If the Enhanced Security Utilities are running,
an unprivileged user may display information
only on files for which Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
levels are dominated by the user's current level.
A user with the appropriate privileges may display information on all 
files.
.DE
For a list of operations and the privileges needed to perform them, see the appendix
.CT "List of Files in the Trusted Computing Base"
in the
.BT "System Administrator's Guide."
.P
Do not use any phrase that refers to ``superuser''
or ``\f4root\fP'' permission.
Use ``appropriate privilege'' instead.
Privileges may be said to apply either to a user or to a process.

.H 3 "Version Macros"
.IX istart version macros
.IX istart Enhanced Security, version macros
The
.SM DOCTOOLS
version macros
.UI \&.VS
and
.UI \&.VE
allow you to print different versions of a document from the same source.
See the
.BT "\s-1DOCTOOLS\s0 User's Guide" .
We have used the version macros to distinguish material that applies to
different versions of the security software:
.BL
.LI
.IX Enhanced Security, B1 and B2 levels
Version 1 material applies only if
the system is running at neither the B2 nor the B1 level of security.
(A system runs at the B2 or the B1 level of security when it has the
Enhanced Security Utilities installed in the appropriate way.
For more information on security levels, see the
.BT "Product Overview." )
.LI
Version 2 material applies only when
the system is running at the B2 level of security.
.LI
Version 3 material applies only when
the system is running at the B1 level of security.
.LE
Material that applies when the system is running at
any security level is not marked by version macros.
.P
It is sometimes convenient to use version macros around blocks of text
larger than the text that is strictly version-dependent.
For example, if there are several version dependencies in a single paragraph,
it may be convenient to put the entire paragraph in version macros,
even though much of it is identical.
This use of version macros implies that, when you change text, you must
know whether the text is in version macros;
if it is, make sure you make your changes
to all appropriate versions of the text.

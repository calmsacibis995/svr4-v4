.SH NAME
\f4ccisubinfo\f1 \- subchannel information on the communications controller.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/usr/lib/cci/ccisubinfo\f1 [\f4\-p \f2portid\f1] \f2slot-ID line-number sub-channel\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4ccisubinfo\f1 displays information about the subchannel on a line on
the communications controller.  The program displays the state of the
subchannel on the controller.  The state can be either attached, or not
attached to a host.  If the subchannel is attached to a host, the host ID
of the active host is displayed.  The number of hosts that are queued on
the subchannel (i.e., the number of hosts other than the active host that
have issued a \f4CCI_Attach\f1 or a \f4CCI_Switch\f1 message) is displayed along with
their host IDs.  The program also displays the Multibus II Transport Port
ID assigned to the subchannel, for sending line discipline specific
messages, if the subchannel is attached to a host.
.PP
Command line options are:
.PP
.TP
\f4\-p \f2n\f1

.PP
The program sends a \f4CCI_Get_Subchannel_Info\f1 message to the CCI server and
prints the information obtained in the reply from the server.  The line
is specified using its  line-number on the controller.  The lines are
numbered starting from 0.  The  subchannel is specified by its number.
The subchannels are numbered starting with 0.  The communications
controller hosting the CCI server is selected by specifying its Multibus II
iPSB \f2slot-ID\f1.

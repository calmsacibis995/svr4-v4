.SH NAME
\f4ccifree\f1 \- frees a line discipline program on the communications controller.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/usr/lib/cci/ccifree\f1 [\f4\-p \f2portid\f1] \f2slot-ID line-discipline-ID\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4ccifree\f1 frees the memory used by a line discipline program which was
previously downloaded to the communications controller using the
\f4cciload\f1(1iref) command. This command must be issued only after
the host has unbound all the lines bound to the line discipline on the
controller using the \f4cciunbind\f1(1iref) commands.  This program sends
a \f4CCI_Free\f1 message to the CCI server on the controller.
.P
Command line options are:
.PP
.TP 
\f4\-p\f1 \f2n\f1
Set the Multibus II Transport source Portid to n instead of the default
value 0x1ff.
.PP
The CCI server will only release the memory used for the line discipline
program when all hosts that have issued \f4CCI_Create\f1 messages for the
script have issued corresponding \f4CCI_Free\f1 messages.
.PP
The host can issue a \f4CCI_Free\f1 message any time after it has issued a
\f4CCI_Create\f1 message.  If it is used before the host receives a response to
the \f4CCI_Create\f1 message, it will be used to cancel the previously issued
\f4CCI_Create\f1 message.  In this case, there will be an error response to
the \f4CCI_Create\f1 message followed by the response to the \f4CCI_Free\f1 message.
.PP
The  \f2line-discipline-ID\f1 specified is associated with a line
discipline on the CCI server.  The  \f2line-discipline-ID\f1 can range
from 0 to 255.  The communications controller hosting the CCI server is
selected by specifying its Multibus II iPSB \f2slot-ID\f1.

.SH NAME
\f4mdl\f1 \- read and optionally write the manufacturer's defect list.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4mdl\f1 [\-\f4N \| \-\f4A\f1] \-\f4c\f1 \f2cylinders\f1 \-\f4d\f1 \f2bytes/sector\f1
.br
\-\f4f\f1 \f2heads\f1 \-\f4s\f1 \f2sectors/track\f1 [\-\f4b\f1] \f2character-device\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4mdl\f1 utility, without a \-\f4A\f1 or \-\f4N\f1 flag, attempts to
read and display the manufacturer's defect list from the disk specified by
\f2character-device\f1.  If the defect list is empty, \f4mdl\f1 asks the
user to add any bad tracks from the printed copy of the list obtained with
the drive, or reported by the system.  \f4mdl\f1 writes this information to
the defect list.
.PP
This utility may be invoked at any time to view or optionally update the
defect list.  However, the new or updated defect list becomes effective
only after \f4hdformat\f1 is executed.
.PP
Specify \f2character-device\f1 as a device file from the /dev directory.
.P
Return values are 0 for successful completion and non-zero for failure.
.P
Command line options are as follows:
.PP
.TP
\-\f4N\f1
Write a new defect list over one that has become corrupted.
.TP
\-\f4A\f1
Append new information to the defect list.
.TP
\-\f4c\f1
The number of cylinders the drive contains.
.TP
\-\f4d\f1
The bytes per sector or density of the drive.
.TP
\-\f4f\f1
The ammount of fixed heads the drive contains.
.TP
\-\f4s\f1
Sectors per track of the drive.
.TP
\-\f4b\f1
Do the operation in batch mode.  The format of the output to stdout is the
format of the input to stdin.
.SH NOTES
The user can add to the bad track list.  Then, at the next
\f4hdformat\f1, these additional bad tracks will be hardware mapped to
alternates rather than software mapped, thus reducing system overhead.

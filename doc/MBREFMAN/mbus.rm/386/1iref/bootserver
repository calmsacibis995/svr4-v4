.SH NAME
\f4bootserver\f1 \- starts a Multibus II boot service daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4bootserver \f1[\f4-c \f2configfile\f1] [\f4-l \f2logfile\f1] [\f4-x \f2loglevel\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4bootserver\f1 starts a booting service for Multibus II.
Once invoked, \f4bootserver\fP 
disconnects itself from the invoking terminal and process, opens its Multibus 
II Transport listening port (0x500), and listens for booting and configuration 
requests from other processor hosts on Multibus II.  The information given for 
the requests is specified in the configuration file.
Refer to the \f2Multibus II System Architecture Bootstrap Specification\fP
for exact details.
.P
Command line options are:
.TP
\f4\-c \f2configfile\f1
The specified file is used as the configuration file.  If no 
configuration file is specified, the \f4bootserver\fP asks the
\f4bps\f1(7iref) driver for 
the name of the configuration file specified by the parameter
\f4BL_config_file\fP.  
If that fails, the \f4/etc/default/bootserver/config\fP file is used.
Refer to \f4config\f1(4iref) for the format of the configuration file.  
.TP
\f4\-l \f2logfile\f1
Activity information is written to the specified \f2logfile\fP.  
Logging information is written as text lines that begin with a date/time stamp 
followed by the message.  No effort is made to restrict the size of the 
\f2logfile\fP.  If no \f2logfile\fP parameter is given, the activity
information will be written to standard output.
.TP
\f4\-x \f2loglevel\f1
Controls the amount of information written to the \f2logfile\fP.
The \f2loglevel\fP can be one of the following decimal values:
.P
.RS
.PD 0
.TP
0 =
error logging only
.TP
1 =
error and connect information (default)
.TP
2 =
level 1 plus detailed communication information
.RE
.P
If \f2loglevel\fP 1 is specified, information on what is 
being requested from the \f4bootserver\fP and who is requesting it is reported.
.P
If no \f4-x\fP parameter is specified, the \f2loglevel\fP defaults to 1.

.SH NOTES
Parameters that are duplicated in a host configuration line and in the global 
configuration line are duplicated in the boot parameter string that is returned 
to the host.

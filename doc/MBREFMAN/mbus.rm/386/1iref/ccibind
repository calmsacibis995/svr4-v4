.SH NAME
\f4ccibind\f1 \- binds a line discipline to a line on the communication controller.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/usr/lib/cci/ccibind\f1 [\f4\-p \f2portid\f1] \f2slot-ID line-number line-discipline-ID\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4ccibind\f1 associates a line with a previously loaded line discipline
program on the communications controller.  The line could be either a
physical serial communications line on the controller or it could be
used to associate with a job on the controller. The interpretation of
the line is left to the line discipline program on the controller.
In addition, this host is registered as a potential user of the line.
This program sends a \f4CCI_Bind\f1 message to the CCI server.  The response
to this command will contain the maximum subchannels supported on this
line by the line discipline and this will be displayed by the command
on the issuing host.  The host issuing this command must have previously
issued a \f4CCI_Create\f1 message using the \f4cciload\f1(1iref) command
to set up the line discipline on the controller.  Otherwise an error will
be returned from the CCI server.
.PP
Command line options are:
.PP
.TP
\f4\-p \f2n\f1
Set the Multibus II Transport source Portid to \f2n\f1 instead of the
default value 0x1ff.
.PP
A host can bind a line to a \f2line-discipline-ID\f1 only once.  The first
\f4CCI_Bind\f1 message issued for the line causes a job to be created for the
line.  Subsequent \f4CCI_Bind\f1 messages from other hosts for the  same line
and \f2line-discipline-ID\f1 will cause these hosts to be added to the set
of potential users of the line.  If one of these messages contains a
\f2line-discipline-ID\f1 that is different from the \f2line-discipline-ID\f1 bound
to the line, an error response will be returned by the CCI server.
.PP
The \f2line-discipline-ID\f1 specified is associated with a line
discipline image on the controller.  The \f2line-discipline-ID\f1 can
range from 0 to 255.  The \f2line-number\f1 can range from 0 to
\f4MAX_LINES - 1\f1, where \f4MAX_LINES\f1 is returned in the \f4ccisrvinfo\f1(1iref)
command.  The communications controller hosting the CCI server is selected
by specifying its Multibus II iPSB slot-ID.

.SH NAME
\f4cciswitch\f1 \- switch a subchannel on a line to a new host on the communications controller.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/usr/lib/cci/cciswitch\f1 [\f4\-p \f2portid\f1] \f2slot-ID line-number sub-channel new-host-ID\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4cciswitch\f1 causes the issuing host to temporarily relinquish control
of a subchannel on the communications controller to another host.
This program sends a \f4CCI_Switch\f1 message to the CCI server.  If at the
time the \f4CCI_Switch\f1 message is received by the server and the subchannel
is already attached by the specified new host, the response for the
\f4CCI_Switch\f1 message will be delayed until the other host relinquishes
control of the subchannel and control eventually comes back to this host.
Otherwise an error response is returned immediately.
.PP
Command line options are:
.PP
.TP
\f4\-p \f2n\f1
Set the Multibus II Transport source Portid to \f2n\f1 instead of the
default value 0x1ff.
.PP
When this host gets control of the subchannel, the response will contain: 
.P
.IP
the host ID of the previous host
.IP
the line discipline specific information (returned from the line
discipline program running on the line)
.IP
the status of the session on the subchannel from the previous host
.PP
The host issuing this command must have previously issued a \f4CCI_Attach\f1
message (using the \f4cciattach\f1(1iref) command) to be the active host
on the subchannel.  Otherwise an error will be returned from the CCI
server.
.PP
The line-number can range from 0 to \f4MAX_LINES - 1\f1, where \f4MAX_LINES\f1 is
returned in the \f4ccisrvinfo\f1(1iref) command.  The sub-channel can
range from 0 to \f4MAX_SUBCHANNELS - 1\f1, where \f4MAX_SUBCHANNELS\f1 is returned in
the \f4ccibind\f1(1iref) command.  The new-host-ID is specified using its
Multibus II iPSB \f2slot-ID\f1.  The communications controller hosting
the CCI server is selected by specifying its Multibus II iPSB \f2slot-ID\fP.

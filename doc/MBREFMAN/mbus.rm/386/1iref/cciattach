.SH NAME
\f4cciattach\f1 \- Creates a connection to a subchannel on the communications
controller.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/usr/lib/cci/cciattach\f1 [\f4\-p \f2portid\f1] \f2slot-ID line-number sub-channel\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4cciattach\f1 associates a subchannel on a previously bound line with
this host on the communications controller.  This program sends a
\f4CCI_Attach\f1 message to the CCI server.  If at the time the \f4CCI_Attach\f1
message is received by the CCI server and the subchannel is already
attached by another host, the response will be delayed until the other
host relinquishes control of the subchannel and control eventually comes
back to this host.  When the response arrives, a Multibus II Transport
portID will be returned for the subchannel.  The issuing host may now
send line discipline specific messages to the line discipline program
directed at the subchannel using this port ID.  This host remains the
active host on the subchannel until it gives up control either by
using the \f4ccidetach\f1(1iref) command or the \f4cciswitch\f1(1iref)
command.
.P
Command line options are:
.PP
.TP
\f4\-p \f2n\f1
Set the Multibus II Transport source Portid to \f2n\f1 instead of the
default value 0x1ff.  This value is also used in the default_portid
field of the \f4CCI_Attach\f1 message.
.PP
The host can receive a response to the \f4CCI_Attach\f1 message as a result of
another host sending a \f4cciswitch\f1(1iref) or a \f4ccidetach\f1(1iref)
command to the CCI server.  In this case, the \f4CCI_Attach\f1 response will
indicate this fact and will contain the host ID of the previous host.
The response also contains the line discipline specific information
returned from the line discipline program and the status of the session
on the subchannel from the previous host.
.PP
The host issuing this command must have previously issued \f4CCI_Bind\f1
message using the \f4ccibind\f1(1iref) command to register itself
as a potential user of the line.  Otherwise an error will be returned
from the CCI server.
.PP
The \f2line-number\f1 can range from 0 to (\f4MAX_LINES - 1\f1), where
\f4MAX_LINES\f1 is returned in the \f4ccisrvinfo\f1(1iref) command. The
subchannel can range from 0 to (\f4MAX_SUBCHANNELS - 1\f1), where
\f4MAX_SUBCHANNELS\f1 is returned in the \f4ccibind\f1(1iref) command.
The communications controller hosting the CCI server is selected by
specifying its Multibus II iPSB slot-ID.

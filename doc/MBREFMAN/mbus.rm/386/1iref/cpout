.SH NAME
\f4cpout\f1 \- copy out file archives to multiple volumes
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4cpout\f1 [\f4\-a] [\f4\-c] [\f4\-B] [\f4\-v] [\f4\-V] [\f4\-k]
.br
[\f4\-C \f2bufsize\f1] [\f4\-M \f2message\f1] \f2nblks specfile\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4cpout\f1 program reads the standard input to obtain a list of
pathnames and then copies those files into the file specified in
\f2specfile\f1.  The output is written in cpio format.  The output medium
is assumed to be nblks blocks in size, where a block is 512 bytes if
the \f4\-k\f1 option is not specified, and 1024 bytes if the \f4\-k\f1
option is specified.  When \f4cpout\f1 finishes writing the number of
blocks specified in nblks, it prints the message:
.P
.nf
\f4Insert Volume #:<RETURN> to continue, s<RETURN> to skip\f1
.fi
.P
To continue, replace the medium and press \f4<RETURN>\f1.  Typing
\f4s <RETURN>\f1 causes \f4cpout\f1 to skip to the next volume of the
output medium.  Each volume becomes an independent cpio archive.
The above message also appears as a prompt before beginning to write the
first volume of the output medium.
.PP
The options are:
.PP
.TP
\f4\-a\f1
Resets access time of input files after they have been copied.
.TP
\f4\-c\f1
Writes header information in ASCII format for portability.
(Always use this option when the origin and destination machines are
different types.)
.TP
\f4\-B\f1
Blocks output 5,120 bytes per record (meaningful only with data directed
to a character special device.)
.TP
\f4\-v\f1
Prints a list of file names as they are processed.
.TP
\f4\-V\f1
Special verbose mode.  This option causes a dot to be printed for each
file seen.
.TP
\f4\-k\f1
Sets the block size to 1024 bytes.  Default is 512 bytes.
.TP
\f4-C\f1
Causes the input/output to be blocked bufsize bytes per record.
\f2bufsize\f1 must be a positive integer.  The default buffer size
is 512 bytes when the \f4-C\f1 and \f4-B\f1 options are not specified.
The \f4-C\f1 option is meaningful only with data directed to or from
a character special file (for example, \f4/dev/rmt/c0s0)\f1.
.TP
\f4-M\f1
Used to define a message to be displayed when the end of an output medium
is reached.  Data inconsistencies are introduced when the end of the
physical medium is reached.  Thus, if  this message appears, it
indicates that data corruption may have occurred.
.SH FILES
\f4/sbin/cpout\f1
.SH NOTES
Upon completion, the \f4cpout\f1 command writes the number of output volumes
processed to stderr.
.PP
The \f2specfile\f1 argument cannot be an ordinary file.  Normally,
\f2specfile\f1 will
be the pathname of a special device file such as a tape drive or a floppy
disk drive.  This must be specified as the raw device.
.PP
Reaching the end of the physical medium before nblks blocks are written is
not allowed and results in inconsistent data written to the output medium.
Therefore, the value of nblks must always be less than the actual number
of blocks that the output medium can contain.

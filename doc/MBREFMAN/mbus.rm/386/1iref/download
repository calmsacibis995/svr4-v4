.SH NAME
\f4download\f1 \- loads 8086 absolute library and object module formats
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/usr/lib/cci/download\f1 [\f4\-b \f2buffer size\f1] [\f4\-t \f2time delay\f1]
.br
[\f4\-p \f2portid\f1] [\f4\-lrv] \f2file-name  slot-ID\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4download\f1 loads Absolute OMF86 and LIB86 format files onto a target
board having the Download Protocol Routine resident in firmware (such as
the iSBC\(rg 186/410 and the iSBC 186/530).  An executable memory image of
the file is constructed in the local memory of the target.  After
loading, control on the target is transferred to the start address
specified within the file (unless the \f4\-l\f1 option is specified).
.PP
The program opens and reads the specified file and interprets the OMF.
The image is transferred to the target using Multibus II Transport.
.PP
Command line options are:
.PP
.TP
\f4\-b\f2n\f1
Set the temporary buffer size to \f2n\f1 bytes instead of the default
32,000 bytes.  
.TP
\f4\-t\f2n\f1
Set the number of milliseconds to wait between transport messages used to
transfer the image to the target.  The default is 10.
.TP
\f4\-p\f2n\f1
Set the Multibus II Transport portID for this host to \f2n\f1 instead of
the default 36864.  
.TP
\f4-l\f1
Load only.  Loads the specified file onto the target, but does not 
transfer control or begin execution.
.TP
\f4\-r\f1
Reset.  Performs a local reset to the target board before loading begins.
.TP
\f4-v\f1
Verbose.  Normally, download does its work silently.  This option causes
each module name to be printed as it is loaded.
.PP
The file must be in  Absolute OMF86 or LIB86 format.  Overlays are not
supported.  The target board is selected by specifying its
Multibus II iPSB slot-ID.

.SH NAME
\f4cciload\f1 \- load a line discipline program on to the communications controller.
.SH SYNOPSIS
 \f4/usr/lib/cci/cciload\f1 [\f4\-p \f2portid\f1] [\f4\-v\f1] \f2slot-ID
.br
line-discipline-ID line-discipline-filename\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4cciload\f1 reads a line discipline program file and sends it to the
CCI server on the communications controller.  The line discipline program
is sent to the CCI server only if the line discipline is not present on
the controller. The program obtains this information in the reply to
the \f4CCI_Create\f1 message sent to the CCI server.  The state of the line
discipline on the controller can be obtained using the \f4ccildlist\f1(1iref)
or the \f4ccildinfo\f1(1iref) commands.
.PP
Command line options are:
.PP
.TP
\f4\-p \f2n\f1
Set the Multibus II transport source port-id to \f2n\f1 instead of the
default value 0x1ff.
.TP
\f4\-v\f1
Verbose.  Normally, the line discipline is loaded silently.  This option
will print trace information while the line discipline is being loaded.
.PP
The program first issues a \f4CCI_Create\f1 message and checks the status of
the reply from the CCI Server.  If the status indicates that the line
discipline already exists on the communications controller, a message
is printed to that effect and the program exits.  If the status indicates
that the line discipline does not exist, the program will read the
specified line discipline file and send it to the controller by issuing
\f4CCI_Download\f1 messages.  If an error occurs while downloading the line
discipline, the program will issue a \f4CCI_Free\f1  message to the CCI server
and exit.
.PP
The  \f2line-discipline-ID\f1 specified is associated with line discipline
image on the CCI server.  The \f2line-discipline-ID\f1 can range from 0 to
255.  The communications controller hosting the CCI server is selected by
specifying its Multibus II iPSB slot-ID.  The line discipline file must be
in OMF86 format.  Only Load-Time-Locatable (LTL) or Position-Independent-Code
(PIC) OMF86 formats are supported.  Overlays are  not supported.

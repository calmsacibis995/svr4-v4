.SH NAME
\f4cciunbind\f1 \- unbinds a line discipline from a line on the communications controller.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/usr/lib/cci/cciunbind\f1 [\f4\-p \f2portid\f1] \f2slot-ID line-number\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4cciunbind\f1 deletes the association established between a line, a
line discipline and this host by an earlier \f4ccibind\f1 (1iref) command.
The program sends a \f4CCI_Unbind\f1 message to the CCI server. 
.PP
This command must be issued only after all the subchannels on the line
attached to this host have been detached.  Otherwise an error will be
returned from the CCI server.
.PP
Command line options are:
.PP
.TP
\f4-p \f2n\f1
Set the Multibus II Transport source Portid to \f2n\f1 instead of the
default value 0x1ff.
.PP
Only the last \f4CCI_Unbind\f1 message issued for the line causes the job
running on the line to be deleted.  The other \f4CCI_Unbind\f1 messages from
other hosts for the same line will cause these hosts to be removed from
the set of potential users of the line.
.PP
The  \f2line-number\f1 can range from 0 to \f4MAX_LINES - 1\f1, where \f4MAX_LINES\f1
is returned in the \f4ccisrvinfo\f1(1iref) command.  The communications
controller hosting the CCI server is selected by specifying its
Multibus II iPSB \f2slot-ID\f1.

.SH NAME
\f4reset\f1 \- resets the processor in a given slot
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/usr/lbin/reset\f1 [\-\f4b\f1]  [\-\f4v\f1]  [\-\f4m\f1 \| \-\f4n\f1 \| \-\f4i\f1 index] \f2slot-ID\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4reset\f1 command issues a local reset to the processor in a given
slot of the bus through interconnect space.  This allows the operator to
shut down one of the processors in a system and reboot it, without being
required to shut the entire system down.  Valid slot numbers are 0 through 20.
.P
Command line options are:
.TP
\-\f4b\f1
The BIST complete bit in the BIST master status register is not set.
Default is to set the bit.
.TP
\-\f4v\f1
Verbose.  Diagnostic information is displayed during execution of the reset
command.
.TP
\-\f4m\f1
The contents of the program table index register (PTIR) are updated to
invoke the debug monitor.  This is the same as specifying \-\f4i 248\f1.
.TP
\-\f4n\f1
The contents of the PTIR are left unchanged.  This allows the user to
sequence through the entries in the program table.
.TP
\-\f4i\f1
Set the value of the program table index register (PTIR) to index.  The
default is 0.

.SH NOTES
For additional information on the values of the program table index register
(PTIR), see the
\f2Multibus II Initialization and Diagnostics Specification\f1.
Also note that when using the \f4reset\f1 command, any processor
can be reset; resulting in a loss of data.

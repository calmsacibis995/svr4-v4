.SH NAME
\f4dbon\f1 \- sets target for front panel message delivery
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4/usr/lbin/dbon\f1 [\f2slot_ID\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4dbon\f1 command instructs the Central Services Module (CSM) where
future Front Panel Interrupt Messages are to be sent.  This is used for
determining which processor will break into the kernel debugger when the
Front Panel Interrupt is issued.
.PP
Setting the CSM to interrupt one's own processor is as follows.
In order to instruct the CSM to interrupt the processor you are using,
execute \f4dbon\f1 with no arguments.  The current slot number is
determined automatically, and given to the CSM as destination of future
front panel interrupt messages.
.PP
Setting the CSM to interrupt another processor is as follows.
In order to instruct the CSM to interrupt another processor, \f4dbon\f1
is executed with the slot number of the desired processor as the argument.
Valid slot numbers are 0 through 21.

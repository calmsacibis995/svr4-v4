.SH NAME
\f4ics\f1 \-  Interconnect Space device driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4ics\f1 driver handles the interface between Multibus II device
drivers or applications and Multibus II Interconnect Space as implemented
by the MPC  component.
.PP
To configure the \f4ics\f1 driver, modify the following variables in the
\f4/etc/conf/pack.d/ics/space.c\f1 file:
.PP
.TP 20
\f2ics_hi_addr\f1
The I/O port address  for selecting the high-order eight bits of the
interconnect address.
.TP
\f2ics_low_addr\f1
The I/O port address for selecting the low-order eight bits of the
interconnect address.
.TP
\f2ics_data_addr\f1
The I/O port address for data to be read or written to the interconnect
register.
.TP
\f2ics_cpu_cfglist\f1
A list of all board types on which UNIX may be running in the system.
This list must be terminated with a NULL pointer.
.TP
\f2ics_bdev\f1
A table listing root, swap, pipe, and dump devices for each possible UNIX
processor in the system.
.TP
\f2ics_max_numcpu\f1
The maximum number of UNIX processor boards permitted in a system.
This must correspond to the number of entries in the \f4ics_bdev\f1 table.
.PP
Following is a list of the supported \f4ioctl\f1() calls provided by the
\f4ics\f1 driver:
.PP
.TP 20
\f4Read Interconnect Space\f1(\f4ICS_READ_ICS\f1)
This command reads Interconnect Space.  It takes a pointer to a
\f4struct ics_rdwr_args\f1 and does the Interconnect Space read operation
encoded therein.
.TP
\f4Write Interconnect Space\f1(\f4ICS_WRITE_ICS\f1)
This command writes Interconnect Space.  It takes a pointer to a
\f4struct ics_rdwr_args\f1 and does the Interconnect Space write operation
encoded therein.
.TP
\f4Find Interconnect Space Record\f1(\f4ICS_FIND_REC\f1)
This command finds a specific Interconnect Space record.  It takes a
pointer to a \f4struct ics_frec_args\f1 and does the Interconnect Space
find record operation encoded therein.
.TP
\f4Get Current Slot ID\f1(\f4ICS_MY_SLOTID\f1)
This command returns the slot ID of the current slot.  It takes a pointer
to an \f4unsigned char\f1 which is set to the Interconnect Space slot id
of the caller.
.TP
\f4Get Current CPU Number\f1(\f4ICS_MY_CPUNUM\f1)
This command returns the CPU number of  the current UNIX processor.  It
takes a pointer to an \f4unsigned char\f1 which is set to the Interconnect
Space CPU number of the caller.  The CPU number is an identifier for this
particular processor. 
.TP
\f4Get Current CPU Number\f1(\f4ICS_MY_CPUNUM\f1)
This command returns the CPU number of  the current UNIX processor.
It takes a pointer to an \f4unsigned char\f1 which is set to the
Interconnect Space CPU number of the caller.  The CPU number is an
identifier for this particular processor. 
.PP
The following is a list of error conditions that may be returned:
.PP
.TP 10
\f4EFAULT\f1
A memory address used in an ioctl was not a valid data address.
.TP
\f4EINVAL\f1
An Interconnect space address used in an \f4ioctl\f1 was not valid, or an
invalid \f4ioctl\f1 request was attempted.

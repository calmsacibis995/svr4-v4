.SH NAME
\f4edlina\f1 \- External Data Link driver for iNA961 Release 3.0.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4edlina\f1 driver provides a STREAMS interface that integrates with
the System V/386 TCP/IP protocol stack.  The \f4edlina\f1 driver is the
end of the streams queue pair providing the interface to the underlying
External Data Link (EDL) offered by iNA961 Release 3.0.  The Link Level
Interface is provided by the \f4edlina\f1 driver by transmitting and
receiving Data Link packets using the communication interface provided by
the i530 driver.
.PP
Configuration and tunable parameters for the \f4edlina\f1 driver are
defined in \f4/etc/conf/pack.d/edlina/space.c\f1.  In order to change
the driver configuration, this file must be edited and the kernel
regenerated.  These parameters are described below:

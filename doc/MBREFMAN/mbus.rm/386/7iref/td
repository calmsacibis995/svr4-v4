.SH NAME
\f4td\f1 \- Multibus tape device drivers
.SH DESCRIPTION
The formats for tape files are:
.PP
.nf
\f4/dev/rmt/c0s0n\f1	no rewind on close, no retension on open
\f4dev/rmt/c0s0\f1	rewind on close, no retension on open
.fi
.PP
These files refer to the QIC-24/QIC-02 basic cartridge tape streamer.  Only
raw character interface files are provided.  
.PP
A standard tape consists of several 512-byte records, terminated by an
end-of-file (EOF).  To the extent possible, the system treats the tape
like any other file.  As in other raw devices, seeks are ignored.  An
EOF is returned as a zero-length read, with the tape positioned after the
EOF so that the next read will return the next record.
.PP
A tape  opened for reading or writing is assumed to be positioned as
desired; that is, reading or writing occurs at the current position.
It is possible to read and write multifile tapes by using the non-rewinding
tape file.
.PP
When a rewind-on-close file (c0s0) is closed, the tape is rewound.  Also, if
the file was opened for writing and data was written, a double EOF
(a double tape mark) is written when the file is closed.
.PP
When a no-rewind-on-close file that was opened for writing is closed, if
data was written, one EOF is written, and the tape is positioned after the EOF.
When a no-rewind-on-close file is closed after being opened for
read-only, the tape is positioned after the EOF following the just-read data.
.PP
The following ioctls are supported:
.PP
.TP 1i
\f4T_RETENSION\f1
retension the tape
.TP
\f4T_RWD\f1
rewind the tape to Beginning of Tape (BOT)
.TP
\f4T_LOAD\f1
rewind the tape to BOT
.TP
\f4T_UNLOAD\f1
rewind the tape to BOT
.TP
\f4T_ERASE\f1
erase the tape and leave it at BOT
.TP
\f4T_WRFILEM\f1
write an EOF (tape mark)
.TP
\f4T_RST\f1
reset the tape device
.TP
\f4T_SFF\f1
skip forward arg files
.PP
When a \f4T_RWD\f1, \f4T_RETENSION\f1, \f4T_LOAD\f1, or \f4T_UNLOAD\f1
\f4ioctl\f1 is requested after a write operation, a double EOF (double
tape mark) is written before the \f4ioctl\f1 is executed.

.SH NAME
\f4console\f1 \- console port device driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4console\f1 device driver provides an interface to the device
driver controlling the physical port assigned as the console port
(for example, the i354 device driver).  Operations performed to the
console are redirected by the console device driver to the device
driver controlling the physical device for interpretation and handling.  
.PP
Following is a list of device drivers that can control physical ports in
Multibus systems.  The console driver provides an interface to one of
these device drivers:
.nf

	i354
	rci
.fi
.PP
If you are writing a device driver in order for it to become the console, it
must  call \f4consregister\f1 with the following parameters:
.nf

	\f4void consregister(ci,co,dev)
	int (*ci)();
	int (*co)();
	dev_t dev;\f1
.fi
.PP
The \f2co\f1 and \f2ci\f1 fields contain pointers to the routines which
handle the output and input operations, respectively, for the kernel
(debug console).  The \f2co_dev\f1 field contains the major-minor number
value for the device driver controlling the /dev/console.  These fields
are set automatically if the i354 or rci devices are used as the
console.  See the
\f2Device Driver Interface/Driver-Kernel Interface (DDI/DKI)
Reference Manual\f1 for information on writing a device driver.

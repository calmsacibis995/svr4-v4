.SH NAME
\f4dma\f1 \- DMA device driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4dma\f1 driver implements the internal DMA interface for device
drivers as described in the \f2Driver
Interface/Driver-Kernel Interface (DDI/DKI) Reference Manual\f1.
.PP
There are no configurable variables for the \f4dma\f1 driver.
.PP
There are no ioctls for the \f4dma\f1 driver.  The \f4dma\f1 driver is
used to support the DMA interface required by the
\f2Device Driver Interface/Driver-Kernel Interface (DDI/DKI)
Reference Manual\f1, which is used in turn to implement other
drivers that have ioctl interfaces.

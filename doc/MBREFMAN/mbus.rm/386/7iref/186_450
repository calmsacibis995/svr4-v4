.SH NAME
\f4186/450\f1 \- iSBC 186/450 serial communications controller
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4186/450\f1 is a 186-based 12 channel serial board. The \f4atcs\f1 server 
runs on this board.  The \f4atcs\f1 device driver on the client hosts send 
messages to this server to access the 12 ports.  The \f4atcs\f1 firmware is 
downloaded automatically when the system is booted.  Information indicating the 
success or failure of this is displayed on the console at system initialization 
time.
.P
The \f4atcs\f1 server on the iSBC 186/450 can support a maximum of 24 channels -- 12 onboard 
ports and 12 MPI/450 ports.  The server will look in the next higher-numbered 
slot for an MPI/450 board.  If one is found, the 12 onboard ports will be 
mapped to line numbers 0 - 11 and the 12 MPI/450 ports will be mapped to line 
numbers 12 - 23.
.P
When a 186/450 board is added or removed from the system, the \f4atcs_info\f1 
structure in \f4/etc/conf/space.c/atcs/space.c\fP must be altered as described in
\f4atcs\fP(7iref).  If an MPI/450 board is also added to be controlled by the \f4atcs\f1 
server on the iSBC 186/450, this information must also be included.  For example, 
suppose there is an iSBC 186/450 board in slot 5 and an MPI/450 is in slot 6.  If the 
\f4atcs\f1 minor numbers begin at 16 for this board,
the line added to the \f4atcs_info\f1 
structure to indicate that 24 channels are being supported would be:

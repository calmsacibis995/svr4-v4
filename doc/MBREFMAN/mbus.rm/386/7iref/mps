.SH NAME
\f4mps\f1 \- Message Passing Space device driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4mps\f1 driver handles the interface between Multibus II device drivers
or applications and Multibus II message passing space as implemented by the
MPC component.
.PP
To configure the \f4mps\f1 driver, modify the following variables in the
\f4/etc/conf/pack.d/mps/space.c\f1 file:
.PP
.TP 15
\f2mps_max_tran\f1
The maximum number of outstanding transactions to be allowed. This number
must correspond to the number of entries in the \f4mps_tinfo\f1 and
\f4mps_t_ids\f1 arrays declared in the \f4space.c\f1 file.
.TP
\f2mps_max_port\f1
The maximum number of open ports to be allowed. This number must correspond
to the number of entries in the \f4mps_port_defs\f1 and \f4mps_port_ids\f1
arrays declared in the \f4space.c\f1 file.
.PP
The \f4mps\f1 driver does not support any \f4ioctl\f1 calls for use by
applications.  Instead, it supports the Message Passing interface required by
the
\f2Device Driver Interface/Driver-Kernel Interface (DDI/DKI)
Reference Manual\f1, which is used by other device drivers.

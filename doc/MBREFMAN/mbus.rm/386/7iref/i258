.SH NAME
\f4i258\f1 \- iSBC 386/258 peripheral controller device driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4i258\f1 device driver provides an interface to hard disk and
flexible disk devices  controlled by the Peripheral Controller Interface
(PCI) running on an Intel iSBC 386/258 peripheral controller board.
[For cartridge tape support, see \f4i258tp\f1(7iref)].  The iSBC 386/258
board supports the SCSI device interface. 
.PP
This driver supports up to four hard disk drives and two diskette drives
on one controller board.  The driver supports one or two controller
boards, with two boards as the default configuration.
.PP
The interface to the \f4i258\f1 driver is the standard UNIX System V/386 block
and character device interface.  
.SH CONFIGURATION
The \f4i258\f1 driver communicates with the PCI, which in turn
communicates with SCSI devices.  The PCI and SCSI interfaces address
devices differently.  When configuring the driver, use the PCI unit
addressing scheme to address devices; the PCI translates addresses received
from the driver to the proper SCSI addresses.  For information on this
address translation, see
\f2How To Use The Peripheral Controller Interface (PCI) Server\f1.
.PP
By default, the \f4i258\f1 driver uses the first two instances of the PCI server executing on the 386/258 board(s), that are found by the two lowest slot positions.
The \f4i258\f1 driver performs a LOCATE PCI function to determine the total instances
of PCI (instances are counted from 1).  There are two ways to select a PCI 
server instance and a 386/258 board instance:
.IP "1."
In the \f4/etc/conf/pack.d/i258/space.c file\f1:
.RS
.IP -
Specify the instances of the 386/258 board (running PCI) in the
\f4i258pci_bin\f1 array.
.IP -
Specify the instances of the PCI server in the \f4i258pci_sin\f1 array.
.RE
.IP
Check that the \f4i258pci_bin\f1 and \f4i258pci_sin\f1 arrays match, since the 
\f4i258\f1
driver does not check for consistency.
.IP "2."
Add the following parameters in the \f4bps\f1 file \f4/etc/default/bootserver/config\f1 for the host booting System V/386:
.IP
\f4i258x = i258pci_bin:n1,i258pci_sin:n2;\f1
.IP
\f2n1\f1 and \f2n2\f1 are the desired instances and \f2x\f1 represents characters of your
choice, if you have more than one PCI server or 386/258 board.
.IP
The \f4i258\f1 driver uses the \f4bps\f1 driver function \f4bps_get_wcval\f1 to retrieve parameters.
.P
Configuration for the \f4i258\f1 driver is handled by the following data structures: the minor table, the board table, the drive table, and the partition table.
.IP "Minor Table"
The minor table (\f4i258minor\f1 structure) maps a logical device's minor number to a partition
on a physical device.  A physical device consists of a specific unit
on a board.  The unit numbers in the \f4i258 minor table\f1 are the
PCI unit numbers for the specified devices.  The table on the next page
shows how the minor numbers are mapped onto the list of possible
boards, devices, and PCI units.  For more information on minor number
assignments, see \f4i258minor\f1 in the file
\f4/etc/conf/pack.d/i258/space.c\f1.
.IP "Board Table"
The board table (\f4i258cfg\f1 structure) is an array of structures containing the
information required to access each board in the system.  A board is
selected by the board index in the \f4minor table\f1.  Each entry in
this table contains the information required to communicate with the
board, and a pointer to the drive table for each device connected to
the board.  See \f4i258cfg\f1 in the file \f4/usr/include/sys/i258.h\f1.
.IP "Drive Table"
The drive table (\f4i258cdrt\f1 structure) is an array of structures.
Each structure contains a physical description of the device and a pointer
to the partition table for the device.
There is at least one \f4drtab\f1 entry for each device known to the
operating system.
The unit index in the minor table is used to select which
\f4drtab\f1 to use,
and the \f4drtab\f1 entry is selected by the \f4drtab\f1 index.
See \f4i258drtab\f1 and \f4i258cdrt\f1 in the
file \f4/usr/include/sys/i258.h\f1.
.IP "Partition Table"
The partition table (\f4i258part structure\f1) is a description of logical
portions of a given device.
The entry in the partition table is selected by the 
partition index in the minor table.
See \f4i258part\f1 in the file \f4/usr/include/sys/i258.h\f4 and partition in the file \f4/usr/include/sys/vtoc.h\f1.

\(**
The i258 driver only supports two diskette drives.
.TP 4
\(**\(**
The i258 driver only supports one tape drive.
.P
The device driver requires the Volume Label,
Physical Description Information (pdinfo),
and Volume Table of Contents (vtoc) information to access a given hard 
disk drive.
To allow disks to be interchangeable, the information is stored
on the disk itself.
All of this information is placed on the device during system installation.
.IP "Volume Label"
The driver reads the volume label to determine disk characteristics and
to locate the pdinfo.
The volume label is read when the driver first opens a device.
For data structure definitions,
see \f4ivlab\f1 in the file \f4/usr/include/sys/ivlab.h\f1.
.IP pdinfo
The \f4pdinfo\f1 contains additional device characteristics,
and pointers to the \f4vtoc\f1 and alternate table.
\f4pdinfo\f1 is read when the driver first opens a device.
For data structure definitions, see \f4pdinfo\f1 in the file
\f4/usr/include/sys/vtoc.h\f1.
.IP vtoc
The \f4vtoc\f1 contains the partition information required by
the driver to access the hard disk drive.
\f4vtoc\f1 is read when the driver first opens a device.
For data structure definitions, see \f4vtoc\f1 in the file
\f4/usr/include/sys/vtoc.h\f1.
.IP "SW alt inf"
This is the software bad block handling table.
It resides the file \f4/usr/include/sys/alttbl.h\f1.
.IP mdl
Manufacturer's Defect List--This is the defective track list read from 
the hard disk drive.
It is in the file \f4/usr/include/sys/bbh.h\f1.
.PP
The \f4drive table\f1 and \f4partition table\f1 contain lists of the
default configurations for devices controlled by the driver.
When configuring the \f4i258\f1 driver, you may want to add devices with
different characteristics than the default devices.  
.PP
The following steps provide an overview of the procedure you must follow
to add a new device:
.PP
.TP 5
1.
Add an entry into the drive table for the new device type.  The
drive table is in the file \f4/etc/conf/pack.d/i258/space.c\f1.
Hard disks drives are defined in the structure \f4i258cdrt i258d00[]\f1,
diskette drives in the structure \f4i258cdrt i258f00[]\f1, and tape
drives in the structure \f4i258cdrt i258t00[]\f1.
.TP 5
2.
Add an entry to the partition table for each partition on the new
device type.  The \f4partition table\f1 is in the file
\f4/etc/conf/pack.d/i258/space.c\f1.  Partitions for diskette drives
are defined in the structure \f4i258cdrt i258Pf0[]\f1.  Partitions for
tape drives are not configurable.  Partition information for hard disks
is determined at runtime from the volume table of contents (vtoc) on
the drive.  (See \f4/usr/include/sys/vtoc.h\f1 for information on the
vtoc.)
.TP 5
3.
Put an entry into the \f4minor table\f1 for each partition of the new
device.  You may use the minor numbers listed as unsupported in the
previous table, or replace a device currently in the minor table if
you will no longer be using that device.  
.TP 5
4.
Use the \f4mknod\f1(1M) command to create a node in the \f4/dev\f1
directory.  Follow the naming conventions for the various device types
listed in the \f4hd\f1(7iref), \f4fd
\f1(7iref), and \f4td\f1(7iref) man pages.
Be sure that the minor number you use in the \f4mknod\f1(1M) command
is the same as the minor number in the minor table for the desired
partition.
.PP
An example later in this driver description details the above procedure.
.PP
The partition table is in the \f4i258part\f1 structure in the file
\f4/etc/conf/pack.d/i258/space.c\f1.
.PP
The configuration for the \f4i258tp\f1(7iref) driver is handled by the
same data structures as the \f4i258\f1 driver.  The \f4i258\f1 driver must
be configured into the system in order to configure the \f4i258tp\f1(7iref)
driver.
.SH "Hard Disk Information"
This device driver requires certain information about a disk drive in
order to access the drive.  This information is stored on the disks
themselves.  \f4hd\f1(7iref) discusses the disk
drive information that this and other disk device drivers need.
Also, certain \f4ioctl\f1() calls are supported by all Multibus disk
device drivers.  These calls are listed in the
\f4hd\f1(7iref) man page.
.SH "Flexible Disk Information"
There is a device file in the \f4/dev\f1 directory for each type of
valid  flexible disk drive.
The device filenames follow a specific naming
convention.
See \f4fd\f1(7iref) man page for more information.
.SH EXAMPLE
Following is an example of adding a 3.5-inch diskette drive as unit 0 on board 0
to the \f4i258\f1 driver configuration.
.TP .25i
1.
Add the following to the i258minor structure in the 
\f4/etc/conf/pack.d/i258/space.c\f1 file:
.IP
.ft 4
.nf
/* Board 0 - Floppy 0 */
i258MINOR(0,0,9,45)  /* [ 94] 1.44 Mbytes - f03ht */
i258MINOR(0,0,9,46)  /* [ 95] 1.44 Mbytes - f03hu */
.fi
.ft 1
.TP .25i
2.
Use the following commands to create the device nodes for the new diskette drive
in the proper device directories:
.IP
.ft 4
.nf
/etc/mknod  /dev/dsk/f03ht  b  0  94
/etc/mknod  /dev/dsk/f03hu  b  0  95
/etc/mknod  /dev/rdsk/f03ht  c  0  94
/etc/mknod  /dev/rdsk/f03hu  c  0  95
.fi
.ft 1
.TP .25i
3.
Rebuild the kernel and then shutdown and reboot the system.  To rebuild
the kernel, enter \f4etc/conf/bin/idbuild\f1.  Rebuilding the kernel takes approximately five minutes.

.SH NAME
\f4hd\f1 \- information for Multibus II hard disk device drivers
.SH DESCRIPTION
The i258 device driver can access hard disk drives and supports commands listed
in this section.  This section contains information required for the i258 device
 driver to access the hard disk drive.
.SH Disk Information
Hard disk device drivers require the Volume Label, Physical Description
Information (\f4pdinfo\f1), and Volume Table of Contents (\f4vtoc\f1)
information to access a given hard disk drive.  To allow disks to
be interchangeable, the information is stored on the disk itself.  All of
this information is placed on the device during system installation.
.PP
.TP 1i
\f4Volume Label\f1
The driver reads the volume label to determine disk characteristics and
to locate the \f4pdinfo\f1.  The volume label is read when the driver first
opens a device.  For data structure definitions, see \f4ivlab\f1 in the
file \f4/usr/include/sys/ivlab.h\f1.
.TP 1i
\f4pdinfo\f1
The \f4pdinfo\f1 contains additional device characteristics, and pointers
to the \f4vtoc\f1 and alternate table.  \f4pdinfo\f1 is read when the
driver first opens a device.  For data structure definitions, see
\f4pdinfo\f1 in the file \f4/usr/include/sys/vtoc.h\f1.
.TP 1i
\f4vtoc\f1
The \f4vtoc\f1  contains the partition information required by the driver
to access the hard disk drive.  \f4vtoc\f1  is read when the driver first
opens a device.  For data structure definitions, see \f4vtoc\f1 in the
file \f4/usr/include/sys/vtoc.h\f1.
.TP 1i
\f4SW alt inf\f1
This is the software bad block handling table.  It is in the file
\f4/usr/include/sys/alttbl.h\f1.
.TP 1i
\f4mdl\f1
Manufacturer's Defect List.  This is the defective track list read from
the hard disk drive.  It is in the file \f4/usr/include/sys/bbh.h\f1.
.SH Supported ioctl() Calls
Following is a list of the supported \f4ioctl\f1() calls provided by
Multibus hard disk device drivers.  
.PP
.TP 1i
\f4Get Parameters\f1 (\f4V_GETPARMS\f1)
This command gets configuration parameters for the current device and
partition, and returns them to the user in the \f4cmdarg\f1 structure.
The \f4disk_parms\f1 structure is defined in \f4/usr/include/sys/vtoc.h\f1.
.TP 1i
\f4Format Track\f1 (\f4V_FORMAT\f1)
This command causes the specified track to be formatted.  The format
structure is defined in \f4/usr/include/sys/vtoc.h\f1.
.TP 1i
\f4Configure Driver\f1 (\f4V_CONFIG\f1)
This command  reconfigures the drive with the values passed in the \f4config\f1
structure defined in \f4/usr/include/sys/vtoc.h\f1.
.TP 1i
\f4Configure Driver\f1 (\f4V_REMOUNT\f1)
This command changes the device state flags so when the next open is issued
for the device, configuration information is read from the disk and the
driver's internal tables are reinitialized to reflect the new configuration.
No partition other than zero can be open, and the user id must be zero
to execute this command.
.TP 1i
\f4Load Volume Label\f1 (\f4V_L_VLAB\f1)
This command loads the driver's internal volume label with the data
in the \f4cmdarg\f1 structure.  No partitions other than zero can be open.
The user id must be superuser.  The structure is defined in
\f4/usr/include/ivlab.h\f1.
.TP 1i
\f4Upload Volume Label\f1 (\f4V_U_VLAB\f1)
This command loads the user's \f4cmdarg\f1 structure with data from the
driver's internal volume label.  The structure is defined in
\f4/usr/include/sys/ivlab.h\f1.
.TP 1i
\f4Read Volume Label\f1 (\f4V_R_VLAB\f1)
This command loads the driver's internal volume label with the data from
the hard disk.  This command can only be used on partition zero, by user
id zero, and the disk must contain a valid volume label.  Refer to
\f4/usr/include/sys/ivlab.h\f1 for the starting byte offset of the volume
label.
.TP 1i
\f4Write Volume Label\f1  (\f4V_W_VLAB\f1)
This command writes the driver's internal volume label to the
volume label in the hard disk.  This command can only be used on partition
zero, by user id zero, and the disk must have a properly formatted track zero.
.TP 1i
\f4Load Defect Info\f1 (\f4V_L_MDL\f1)
This command adds the data in the \f4cmdarg\f1 structure to the
driver's internal defect list.  Only partition zero may be
open, and the command may be used only by user id zero.
.TP 1i
\f4Upload Defect Info\f1 (\f4V_U_MDL\f1)
This command returns one entry from the driver's internal defect
list to the user's \f4cmdarg\f1 structure.
.TP 1i
\f4Read Defect List\f1 (\f4V_R_MDL\f1)
This command loads the driver's internal defect list with the
data from the hard disk.  The driver must have a valid volume label in
its tables.  The disk must have a valid defect list on the next to last
cylander for an ST-506 interface, or on the third from last cylander for
an ESDI interface.
.TP 1i
\f4Write Defect List\f1 (\f4V_W_MDL\f1)
This command writes the driver's internal defect list to the
appropriate area of the hard disk.  After the write is complete, the
internal defect list is cleared to zero.  Only partition zero may be
open, and the command may be used only by user id zero.  The driver
must have a valid volume label in its tables.

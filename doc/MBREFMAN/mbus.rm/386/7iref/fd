.SH NAME
\f4fd\f1 \- Information for Multibus  flexible disk device d
rivers
.SH DESCRIPTION
This section contains information required for the \f4i258\f1 and the \f4sf01\f1 device drivers to access the flexible disk drive.  The iSBC 386/258 board uses the \f4i258\f1 driver and the iSBC 486/133SE board uses the \f4sf01\f1 driver.
.P
The flexible disk driver provides access to diskettes as block and raw (characte
r) devices.  Format the diskettes before copying data to them.  Use the 
\f4format\f1(1) command to format diskettes.
.P
Flexible disk device file names are listed in the \f4/dev\f1 directory.
Each filename corresponds to a specific major device number, minor device
number pair.  The minor device number specifies the drive number, the
format of the disk, and the partition number.  The format of flexible disk
device names is:
.P
.ft 4
.nf
/dev/ {r}dsk/f{0,1} {3h,3d,5h,5d9,5d8,5d4,5d16} t
.ft 1
.fi
.P
.TP
\f4rdsk\f1
selects the raw device interface 
.TP
\f4dsk\f1
selects the block device interface
.TP
\f40\f1 or \f41\f1
selects the drive to be accessed: \f4f0\fP selects drive 0, \f4f1\fP selects drive 1.
.TP
\f43h\f1
Indicates 3.5" high density, 18 sectors per track
(1.4 Mbytes) diskette format
.IP
This option is available only with the sf01 driver.  See i258(7iref) on how to
use this option with the i258 driver.
.TP
\f43d\f1
Indicates 3.5" double density, 9 sectors per track
(720 Kbytes) diskette format
.IP
This option is available only with the sf01 driver.  See i258(7iref) on how to
use this option with the i258 driver.
.TP
\f45h\f1
indicates 5.25: high density (1.2Mbytes) diskette format
.TP
\f45d9\f1
indicates 5.25: double density, 9 sectors per track (360 Kbytes) diskette
format
.TP
\f45d8\f1
indicates 5.25: double density, 8 sectors per track (320 Kbytes) diskette
format flexible disk device drivers
.TP
\f45d4\f1
indicates 5.25: double density, 4 sectors per track (360 Kbytes) diskette
format
.TP
\f45d16\f1
indicates 5.25: double density,  16 sectors per track (320 Kbytes) diskette
format
.TP
\f4t\f1
Indicates that the entire diskette will be accessed. Not using
this option will leave track 0 unused.
.P
Besides the file naming convention just described, some of the diskette
formats have alias names that correlate to previous releases.  The
following lists the aliases for the formats that have them:
.TS
center;
cB cB
lf4 lf4 .
format	alias
.sp .5
5h	q15d
5d8	d8d
5d9	d9d
.TE
.PP
For example, the device file \f4/dev/rdsk/f0q15dt\f1 is equivalent to the
device file \f4/dev/rdsk/f05ht\f1.
.SH Supported ioctl() Calls
Following is a list of the supported \f4ioctl\f1() calls provided by
Multibus flexible disk device drivers.  
.PP
.TP 11
\f4Get Parameters\f1 (\f4V_GETPARMS\f1)
This command gets configuration parameters for the current device and
partition, and returns them to the user in the \f4cmdarg\f1 structure.
The \f4disk_parms\f1 structure is defined in \f4/usr/include/sys/vtoc.h\f1.
.TP 11
\f4Format Track\f1 (\f4V_FORMAT\f1)
This command causes the entire diskette to be formatted.  SCSI d
oes not support formatting on a per track basis.  The format structure is define
d in \f4/usr/include/sys/vtoc.h\f1.
.IP
The track number supplied in the format structure must
be 0.
.SH Diskette Drive Jumpering for 486/133SE Board

.SH NAME
\f4mpc\f1 \-  MPC device driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4mpc\f1 driver handles the internal low level interface between the
\f4ics\f1(7iref) and \f4mps\f1(7iref) interface and the actual message
passing coprocessor (MPC) hardware of a Multibus II CPU board.
.PP
To configure the \f4mpc\f1 driver, modify the following variables in the
\f4/etc/conf/pack.d/mpc/space.c\f1 file:
.PP
.TP 20
\f2impc_base\f1
Contains the base I/O port address for the MPC chip.
.TP
\f2impc_fs_enabled\f1
Contains a flag indicating whether or not the MPC fail-safe mechanism should
be used.  It is strongly recommended that the fail-safe mechanism be enabled.
.PP
There are no \f4ioctls\f1 for the \f4mpc\f1 driver.  The \f4mpc\f1 driver
is used to support the internal interface required by the \f4mps\f1(7iref)
driver.

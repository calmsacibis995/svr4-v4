.SH NAME
\f4clock\fP \- Multibus II clock driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4clock\fP driver provides a multiplexed interface to the
CSM clock on Multibus II systems.
It conforms to the AT386 real time clock interface thus providing 
a consistent interface to the UNIX System V/386 Release 4 kernel.
.P
The kernel interface to the \f4clock\fP driver functions is through two 
routines that get and set the time using an address to a structure called 
\f4rtc_t\fP.
The two requests are \f4clkget\fP and \f4clkput\fP.
These routines fail and return 
a -1 if any hardware error occurs while reading or writing the \f4rtc\fP.
The structure is defined in the file \f4/usr/include/sys/rtc.h\fP.
The format of the structure is:
.P
.ft 4
.nf
struct   rtc_t   {
  unsigned char rtc_sec; /*second of minute, 0-59*/
  unsigned char rtc_asec;/*second alarm*/
  unsigned char rtc_min; /*minute of hour, 0-59*/
  unsigned char rtc_amin;/*minute alarm*/
  unsigned char rtc_hr;  /*hour of the day, 1-23*/
  unsigned char rtc_ahr; /*hour alarm*/
  unsigned char rtc_dow; /*day of the week, 1-7*/
  unsigned char rtc_dom; /*day of the month, 1-31*/
  unsigned char rtc_mon; /*month of the year, 1-12*/
  unsigned char rtc_yr;  /*year of the century, 0-99*/
  unsigned char rtc_statusa; /*status register A*/
  unsigned char rtc_statusb; /*status register B*/
  unsigned char rtc_statusc; /*status register C*/
  unsigned char rtc_statusd; /*status register D*/
};
.fi
.P
The user application interface to the \f4clock\fP driver functions
is through two \f4ioctl\fP functions that are the same
as the AT386 clock \f4ioctl\fP functions.
The two requests are \f4RTCTIME\fP and \f4RTCSTIME\fP.
They get and set the time using an address 
to the same structure called \f4rtc_t\fP (shown above).
The \f4ioctls\fP are defined in the file \f4/usr/include/sys/rtc.h\fP.
.P
The following is a list of error conditions that may be returned.
.TP 10
I/O Error [ \f4EIO\fP ]
This error is printed if the driver gets an error while trying to read 
the real-time clock chip.
.TP
Permission Denied [ \f4EACCESS\fP ]
This message is printed if the user trying to access the clock device 
(to set the time) is not the superuser.
The message is also printed if the clock could not be set.
.TP
Invalid Argument [ \f4EINVAL\fP ]
This message is printed if one of the fields used to set the time is 
outside the prescribed limits.

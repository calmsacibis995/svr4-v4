.SH NAME
\f4scsi\f1 \- Multibus II iSBC 486/133SE SCSI Subsystem
.SH DESCRIPTION
The iSBC 486/133SE board uses the Fujitsu SPC 87033 chip to access the SCSI bus.
The \f4scsi\f1 driver implements the SCSI Driver Interface (SDI) for the SCSI 
target drivers (such as \f4sf01\f1 and \f4sd01\f1).
.P
There are three groups of \f4ioctl\f1(2) commands supported by SCSI.  The first group contains the \f4ioctl\f1 commands used by the \f4scsi\f1 driver itself.  
These commands are:
.TP 1i
\f4SDI_SEND\f1
Sends a pass through command to a target controller; bypassing the associated 
target driver.
.TP 1i
\f4B_RESET\f1
Resets the SCSI bus.
.TP 1i
\f4B_REDT\f1
Reads the extended EDT data structure that is stored in the scsi driver's 
internal data structure.
.TP 1i
\f4B_HA_CNT\f1
Gets the value of the number of controllers the \f4scsi\f1 driver is configured for.
.P
The second group of commands are used by the \f4scsi\f1 driver and all target 
drivers that use the SCSI Driver Interface protocol to communicate with their 
associated target controllers.  These commands are:
.IP "\f4B_GETTYPE\f1" 1i
Return the bus name (SCSI) and device driver name of a specific
device.
.IP 
The third group should be used by all target drivers that use the SCSI 
Driver Interface protocol to communicate with their associated target 
controllers. This \f4ioctl\f1 is not supported by the \f4scsi\f1 driver.
.IP "\f4B_GETDEV\f1"
Returns the pass through major and minor number to the calling utility 
to allow creation of a pass through special device file.
.SS Configuration
The \f4scsi\f1 driver configuration file (see FILES below) contains the 
following configurable variables:
.IP "\f4SCSI_BLKS\f1" 1i
Specifies the total number of SCSI Request Blocks the scsi driver will 
allocate.  Note: All SCSI Target drivers utilize this resource.
.IP "\f4sc_conf\f1" 
Determines which SCSI Bus, single-ended or differential, the driver will
control.  The identification is accomplished by specifying the appropriate 
SCSI Bus hardware interface structure, \f4spc_conf\f1.
.IP "\f4spc_se_conf\f1"
Contains the SCSI bus hardware interface structure (\f4spc_conf\f1) 
for the single-ended SCSI bus.
.IP "\f4spc_df_conf\f1"
Contains the SCSI bus hardware interface structure (\f4spc_conf\f1) 
for the differential SCSI bus.
.IP "\f4bus_flags\f1"
Setting \f4bus_flags\f1 to \f4CFG_RESET_BUS\f1 causes the SCSI bus to 
be reset at boot time.  \f4bus_flags\f1 is a member of the \f4spc_conf\f1
structure.
.IP "\f4scsi_id_shift\f1"
Specifies the bit position (0-based) of the 3-bit SCSI ID (least
significant bit).  The SCSI ID resides in the SCSI ID register.   The I/O port
address for the SCSI ID register is specified by the \f4brd_scsi_id\f1 member 
of the \f4spc_conf\f1 structure.
.IP 
\f4scsi_id_shift\f1 is a member the \f4spc_conf\f1 structure.
.IP \f4cfg_sanity\f1
Specifies the sanity word used to validate the configuration data structure.
.IP
\f4cfg_sanity\f1 is a member of the \f4spc_conf\f1 structure.
.P
Each SCSI Bus configuration structure, \f4spc_conf\f1, describes several 
characteristics of a particular SCSI Bus interface.  The configuration data 
usually includes information obtained from the driver's \f4mdevice\f1(4) 
entry and \f4sdevice\f1(4) file located under \f4/etc/conf\f1.
.P
By default, the first \f4sdevice\f1(4) entry is bound to the configuration 
structure for the single-ended SCSI bus ('\f4spc_se_conf\f1') and the 
second entry is bound to the configuration structure for the differential 
SCSI bus ('\f4spc_df_conf\f1').
.SH FILES
.IP "\f4/usr/include/sys/f87033.h\f1" 2.25i
Definitions for data structures.
.IP "\f4/usr/include/sys/spc.h\f1" 
Implementation dependent constants for the Fujitsu SPC 87033 chip and 
the board.
.IP "\f4/etc/conf/pack.d/scsi/space.c\f1"
SCSI driver configuration file.

.SH NAME
\f4iasy\f1 \- asynchronous (terminal) device driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4iasy\f1 driver handles the interface between Multibus terminal device drivers 
and applications as described by the \f4termio\f1(7) specification.
.P
The \f4iasy\f1 driver also supports the \f4termio\f1(7) \f4ioctls\fP
for use by applications.
.SS Configuration
To configure the \f4iasy\f1 driver, modify the following variables in the  
\f4/etc/conf/pack.d/iasy/space.c\f1 file:
.TP 1i
\f2nserial\f1
Indicates the number of terminal devices supported by the system
.  This number cannot exceed 256.
.SS "Device Node Naming Convention (/dev/tty*)"
Multibus serial device drivers (\f4i354\f1, \f4atcs\f1, for example)
register themselves, along with the minor numbers they will use,
with the \f4iasy\f1 driver.
Once this is done, a startup script assigns node names (\f4/dev/tty000\f1,
\f4/dev/tty001\f1, and so on) to the minor number devices.
The node names are assigned in ascending order.
.P
For example, suppose the \f4i354\fP driver registers minor numbers 0 through 3 and 
the \f4atcs\fP driver assigns minor numbers 6 through 8.
The following device nodes are created:

.SH NAME
\f4cci\f1 \- communications controller interface device driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4cci\f1 device driver provides an interface to servers on serial
port controller boards within a Multibus II system.  These servers
manage the use of the serial ports on the controller boards.
.PP
The \f4cci\f1 device driver functions encapsulate the Communications
Controller Interface (CCI) protocol for use by device drivers within
the system which implement a terminal controller interface.  The
Multibus II Transport message passing mechanism is used by the
\f4cci\f1 device driver to communicate with a CCI server running on
a serial controller board.  
.PP
A terminal controller interface driver such as the \f4atcs\f1 device driver
relies on the \f4cci\f1 driver to provide management of serial ports
on a serial controller board.  The  \f4cci\f1 driver handles the
communication between the client host and the CCI server for serial
port connection, dissolution, and switching.  The \f4atcs\f1 driver
may request to attach, detach, or switch from, a channel to a serial
port.  These requests are made via the \f4cci\f1 device driver.

.SH NAME
\f4i354\f1 \- iSBX 354 dual channel serial-port device driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4i354\f1 device driver, together with the \f4iasy\f1(7iref) driver,
provides a \f4termio\fP 
interface to the iSBX 354 dual channel serial controller board on Multibus II 
systems.  The board contains the Intel 82530 Serial Communications Controller 
providing two serial channels to the local processor on which the board is 
mounted.
.P
The \f4i354\f1 driver also supports the two onboard serial ports of the iSBC 386/133 
and iSBC 486/1xx boards.
.P
The \f4i354\f1 device driver contains support for the console device (see 
\f4console\f1(7iref)).   The \f4i354\f1 will automatically be configured 
into the data 
structure \f4conssw\fP [this data structure is used by \f4console\f1(7iref)].
After the \f4i354\f1 driver is configured into \f4conssw\f1, it is used as the 
console device.
.P
Minor numbers from 0 to 3 are reserved for this driver.  Minor numbers are 
passed to the \f4iasy\f1 driver at boot time.  For information on how minor 
numbers are assigned to device nodes, and on how device nodes are named,
see \f4iasy\f1(7iref).
The \f4i354\f1 driver is configured to communicate with the iSBX 354 module 
first and the on board serial ports second.  If the driver finds an iSBX 354 
module, the on board serial ports are ignored.
.P
To change the order the \f4i354\f1 driver searches for serial ports, edit 
the \f4/etc/conf/pack.d/i354/sdev\f1 file.  Find the two lines that begin 
with 'i354.'  Swap the position of these two lines.

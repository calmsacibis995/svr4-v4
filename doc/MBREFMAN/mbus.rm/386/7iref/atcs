.SH NAME
\f4atcs\f1\-asynchronous terminal controller script device driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4atcs\f1 device driver, together with the \f4iasy\fP(7iref) driver,
provides a termio interface to terminal controller scripts running
on serial port controller boards within Multibus II systems.
The \f4atcs\f1 device driver provides 
functions which implement the asynchronous terminal protocol.
.P
The \f4atcs\f1 device driver uses the Multibus II transport message passing mechanism 
to communicate with servers running on serial controller boards (the iSBC 
186/410 Serial Communications Controller board, for example) in the Multibus II 
system.  
.P
The \f4atcs\f1 driver relies upon the \f4cci\fP device driver to set up communication paths 
to a server running on a serial controller board.
Once the \f4cci\fP driver has set 
up a channel for an \f4atcs\f1 line, the \f4atcs\f1 driver may use that channel to 
communicate with a server controlling a port on the serial controller board.
.P
The \f4/etc/conf/pack.d/atcs/space.c\f1
file contains the \f4atcs\f1_info structure.  This 
structure holds information that maps slots and ports to minor numbers, and
specifies which ATCS lines in a system should be configured for UNIX System V/386
Release 4.0.
You need to update this structure if you remove or install any 
asynchronous serial interface ports in the system.
.P
The \f4atcs_info\f1 structure contains the following information:
.TP
\f2slot\fP
The slot number for the board on which an \f4atcs\f1 server 
may be running.
.TP
\f2beg_minor_num\fP
The first ATCS minor number to be allocated for the server board.
.TP	
\f2end_minor_num\fP
The last ATCS minor number to be allocated for the server board.
.TP
\f2beg_port_num\fP
The first hardware port to be allocated for the system relative to that board.
.P
Users enter appropriate values into the fields, and in this manner map ranges 
of minor number onto physical boards and ports.  For example, the structure 
definition to add a 186/450 in slot 5 to a system that has a 258/279 in slot 0 
and a 186/410 in slot 6 is as follows:
.P
.RS
.ft 4
.nf
struct   acts _info   atcs_info[]  =  {
	{0,  6,  11,  0},     /*i279 in slot 0*/
	{5,  12, 23,  0},     /*186/450 in slot 5*/
	{6,  24, 29,  0},     /*186/410 in slot 6*/
	{ICS_MAX_SLOT, 0, 0, 0}
};

.P
Note that the beginning minor number of a following board does not have to 
immediately  follow the ending minor number of the preceding board.  For 
example, the beginning and ending minor numbers for the 186/410 could also be 
40 and 45, respectively.  Each hardware dependent driver registers it's minor 
numbers with the generic streams driver, iasy, at system initialization time.  
The minimum minor allowed in \f4atcs_info\f1 is 6.  Minor numbers 0-5 are reserved 
for other drivers.  The maximum minor number allowed is 255.
.P
Subranges of unit port numbers can also be specified.  For example, for the 
186/450 you could assign ports 0 through 5 for System V/386 Release 4 and ports 6 
through 11 for iRMX.
.P
After modifying the \f4atcs_info\f1 structure, you need to rebuild the kernel and
then shutdown and reboot the system.  To rebuild the kernel, enter 
\f4etc/conf/bin/idbuild\f1.
.P
The system makes the device nodes for the ports at boot time based on the 
information in the \f4atcs_info\f1 structure.
See \f4iasy\f1(7iref) for information on tty node configuration.
.P
The mapping of slot/port to minor number can also be specified with the boot 
parameter string (BPS).
If there is \f4atcs\f1 information in the BPS, the system 
overwrites the information in the \f4atcs_info\f1 structure of the
\f4space.c\fP file. 
BPS mapping has the following format:
.P
.RS
.ft4
.nf 
ASYNC1 = hid: \f2slot_number\f4, minor:\f2range\f4, port: 
\f2first_hardware_port\f4;
.ft1
.fi
.RE
.P
For example, the following shows how the above format could be expressed in the 
BPS:
.P
.RS
.ft4
.nf
ASYNC1 = hid: 0, minor:6-11, port:0;
ASYNC2 = hid: 5, minor:2-23, port;0;
ASYNC3 = hid: 6, minor:24-29, port:0;

.RE
.SH Multiple Processors
Read the following if your system has multiple processor boards:
.IP "-" .25i
Each processor board should allocate the same minor number range to the
serial controller board(s).
.IP "-" .25i
Only one processor can access a serial port at a time.
.IP "-" .25i
Use ttyswitch(1iref) to switch a port between processors.

.SH NAME
\f4hlp\f1 \-Parallel printer driver for iSBC 486/133SE board 
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4hlp\f1 driver provides an \f4lpadmin\f1 interface to the parallel port on an iSBC 486/133SE cpu board.  The parallel port behaves as described in 
\f4termio\f1(7).  Use \f4/dev/lp\f1 to access the printer.
.P
The \f4hlp\f1 driver is configured by the structure \f4lp_cfg\f1 defined in the \f4lp_hiint.h\f1 file as follows:
.P
.RS
.ft 4
.nf
struct lp_cfg {
        int     p_level;
        int     p_porta;
        int     p_portb;
        int     p_portc;
        int     control;
};

.P
This driver uses minor number 5.  The minor number is passed to the \f4iasy\f1
driver at boot time.
.P
The fields are defined as follows:
.IP p_level .75i
Specifies the interrupt level for the system.
.IP p_porta .75i
Specifies the address (in I/O space) of the printer data out port.
.IP p_portb .75i
Specifies the interrupt line and incoming printer status for the printer.
.IP p_portc .75i
Specifies the strobe signal for the printer.
.IP control
Used for the 8255 Programmable Peripheral Interface chip controls.

.SH NOTES
Interrupting the printer power or disconnecting the cable to the printer while 
jobs are being printed could result in a loss of print capabilities.  This won't
affect the system, but you may need to reboot to allow the printer to accept 
further commands.

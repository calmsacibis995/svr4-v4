.SH NAME
\f4i596\f1 \- 82596 Ethernet Driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4i596\f1 driver provides a streams interface that integrates with
the System V/386 TCP/IP protocol stack.  The \f4i596\f1 driver is the
end of the streams queue pair providing the interface to the
data link layer.
.P
The Link Level Interface is provided by the \f4i596\f1 driver by transmitting 
and receiving frames over a physical communications medium via the 
Intel 82596 LAN coprocessor.
.P
Configuration and tunable parameters for the \f4i596\f1 driver are
defined in \f4/etc/conf/pack.d/i596/space.c\f1.  In order to change the
driver configuration, edit this file and then rebuild the kernel.
These parameters are described below:
.TP 1.25i
\f4I596_N_TBD\f1
Number of i596 Transmit Buffer Descriptors.  The default value is 25.
.TP 1.25i
\f4I596_N_FD\f1
Number of i596 Frame Descriptors.  The default value is 50.
.TP 1.25i
\f4I596_N_RBD\f1
Number of i596 Receive Buffer Descriptors.  This value indicates the 
number of Streams Buffers to be allocated for data reception.  The default 
value is 50.
.TP 1.25i
\f4I596_RCVBUFSIZ\f1
Size of Receive Buffers.  This value indicates the size of the 
Stream buffer referenced by the RBD.  The default value is 256.
.TP 1.25i
\f4I596_N_LSAP\f1
Number of Link Service Access Points. The default is 32.

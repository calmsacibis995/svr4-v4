.SH NAME
\f4mix386/450\f1 \- MIX-based terminal controller module and baseboard
.SH DESCRIPTION
The MIX386/450 is the combination of a 386-based MIX base board and a MIX 450 
terminal controller module.  Up to three MIX 450 modules can be connected to a 
base board.  Each module has 12 serial channels.
.P
When the atcs server is running on the MIX386/450 it can support a maximum of 
36 ports (which can be made up of 3 MIX modules, 3 iSBC MPI/450's, or a 
combination of both).  If less than 3 MIX/450 modules are stacked on the MIX386 
baseboard, the onboard \f4atcs\fP server will look in the next, numerically higher, 
slots for iSBC MPI/450 boards until the maximum port limit of 36 is reached or 
it finds a non-MPI/450 board.  The mapping of \f4atcs\f1 server line numbers to ports 
will be 0 - 11 for the first MIX module or MPI/450, 12 - 23 for the second, and 
24 - 35 for the third.
.P
The \f4atcs\fP firmware is loaded by MSA boot. 
The images \f4mix450.bt\fP and \f4mix.stg2\fP in the \f4/usr/lib/cci\fP
directory are loaded.
MIX-specific information must be added to \f4/stand/config\fP.  For example, 
if you have a system with an iSBC 386/258 in slot 0, the first UNIX system  processor 
in slot 2, a second cpu in slot 3, and a mix386/450 in slot 5, your \f4config\fP file 
would look something like this:
.P
.RS
.nf
.ft 4
#
# sample configuration file for mix386/450
#
#
[BL_Host_id=GLOBAL];
	pci_hosta = 0;
	unix_hosta = 2;
	unix_hostb = 3;
	mix_hosta = 5;

# PCI and UNIX host information
		.
		.
		.

# mix host
[BL_Host_id=$mix_hosta; BL_method=Dependent];
	BL_Second_stage = /usr/lib/cci/mix.stg2;
	BL_Target_file = /usr/lib/cci/mix450.bt;
.fi
.RE
.P
When a MIX386/450 board and modules are added or removed from the system, the 
\f4atcs_info\fP structure in \f4/etc/conf/space.c/atcs/space.c\fP must be altered as 
described in \f4atcs\fP(7iref).  If an MPI/450 board is also added to be controlled 
by the \f4atcs\fP server on the MIX386/450, this information must also be included.  
For example, suppose there is a MIX386/450 board in slot 5 with 2 MIX modules 
and an MPI/450 is in slot 7.  If the \f4atcs\fP minor numbers begin at 16 for this 
board, the line added to the \f4atcs_info\fP structure to indicate that 36 channels 
are being supported would be:
.P
.nf
.ft 4
{5, 16, 51, 0} /* ATCS server slot, beginning 
                  and ending minor numbers, 
                  first ATCS line number (port) */

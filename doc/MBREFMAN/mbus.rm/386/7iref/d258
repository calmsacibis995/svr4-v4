.SH NAME
\f4d258\f1 \- i82258 ADMA device driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4d258\f1 driver handles the internal low level interface between
the \f4dma\f1(7iref) interface and the actual DMA hardware of a
Multibus II board.
.PP
To configure the \f4d258\f1 driver, modify the following variables in
the  \f4/etc/conf/pack.d/d258/space.c\f1 file:
.PP
.RS
.TP 1i
\f2d258_base\f1
The base I/O port address for the i82258 chip.
.TP 1i
\f2d258_gmr\f1
The bit mask to be loaded into the mode register of the i82258 chip.
Do not modify this variable.
.TP 1i
\f2d258_gbr\f1
The maximum number of contiguous bus cycles to be used for DMA.  A zero
is used to indicate unlimited length transfers are permitted.
.TP 1i
\f2d258_gdr\f1
The number of bus cycles to wait between DMA bursts.
.TP 1i
\f2d258_sbx_base\f1
The base address for DMA to/from the iSBX module.
.TP 1i
\f2d258_sbx_sw_chan0_swconf\f1
A flag indicating that dma has been configured for iSBX channel 0. 
.TP 1i
\f2d258_sbx_sw_chan1_swconf\f1
A flag indicating that dma has been configured for iSBX channel 1.
.RE
.PP
There are no ioctls for the \f4d258\f1 driver.  The \f4d258\f1 driver is
used to support the DMA interface required by the
\f2Device Driver Interface/Driver-Kernel Interface (DDI/DKI)
Reference Manual\f1, which is used in turn to implement other
drivers which do have ioctl interfaces.

.SH NAME
\f4ics_write\f1 \- writes into interconnect registers of the board
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4ret\f1  \= \f4ics_write\f1 (\f2fd\f1, \f2slot\f1, \f2register\f1, \f2buf\f1, \f2count\f1);
.br
\f4int \f2fd\f1;
.br
\f4unsigned short \f2slot\f1;
.br
\f4unsigned short \f2register\f1;
.br
\f4char *\f2buf\f1;
.br
\f4int \f2count\f1;
.br
\f4int ret\f1;
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function will write into interconnect registers of the board in \f2slot\f1
number slot.   \f2count\f1 registers starting from \f2register\f1 number
register of the board are written from the values provided in the buffer
pointed to by \f2buf\f1.
.PP
If there is no board in the designated \f2slot\f1, or, if the register number
specified does not exist in the interconnect space of the board, the results
are undefined.
.SH NOTES
Be careful when using \f4ics_write\f1.  With \f4ics_write\f1, an
applications program can reset any board on the bus, possibly resulting
in a loss of data.

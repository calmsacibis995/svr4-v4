\f4ics_read\f1 \- reads interconnect registers of the board and returns the
values in the buffer
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
\f4ics_read\f1 reads the interconnect registers of the board in the designated
slot and returns the values in the buffer pointed to by \f2buf\f1.
\f2count\f1 number of registers are read starting from \f2register\f1.
.PP
If there is no board in the designated \f2slot\f1, or, if the register number
specified does not exist in the interconnect space of the board, the read
value is undefined.  Thus, to determine if a board is present in a slot, the
vendor ID registers in the interconnect space should be used.  Zero (0) in
the vendor ID register is defined to indicate the absence of a board.

.SH NAME
\f4ics_find_rec\f1 \- finds a specific record in the interconnect space of
a board
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f4register = ics_find_rec(\f2fd\f1, \f2slot\f1, \f2recordid\f1)
.br
\f4int \f2fd\f1;
.br
\f4unsigned short \f2slot\f1;
.br
\f4unsigned char \f2recordid\f1;
.br
\f4int register\f1;
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function is used to find a specific record in the interconnect space
of a board.  \f2slot\f1 is the slot number of the board whose interconnect
space is searched for a record with the record ID \f2recordid\f1.  If such a
record is found, its starting register number is returned.  If the
interconnect space register can not be found in the specified slot, a -2
is returned.  Otherwise, -1 is returned.

.H 1 "Interconnect-Space Application Interface"
This chapter lists the functions that make up the Interconnect-Space
Application Interface.  This interface is defined in the following routines:
.BL
.LI
\f4ics_find_rec\f1
.LI
\f4ics_read\f1
.LI
\f4ics_write\f1
.LE
.P
The functions take a file descriptor as the first argument.  The file
descriptor is obtained by opening the special device \f4/dev/ics\f1 with the
system call open.  The routines are synchronous and return on completion
of the request.
.P
The interconnect space of any board on the Multibus II backplane can
be accessed from a UNIX System V/386 application using these functions.
Accessing a board's interconnect space is useful for system maintenance
and administrative functions.

.H 1 "Window Interface"
The iSBX 279 module provides the user with:
.BL
.LI
A windowed environment
.LI
A mouse to manipulate the windows
.LI
A PC style keyboard for entering data
.LE
.P
The following sections describe what the windows are and how to manipulate
them with the mouse.
.H 2 "Windows, What are They?"
The windows provided by the 279 module are ways of viewing many operations
simultaneously on one screen.  They can be thought of as many terminals
contained in one; each window representing a terminal.  For example, the
SYP 520 initializes with three windows: one for console input, one for
displaying kernel messages and for using the debugger, and one for
displaying messages from the Master Test Handler (MTH) (see Figure A-1).
What would have required three terminals to view now requires one.
.P
The windows can be manipulated with the mouse (moved, resized, and relayered)
so that all or some of the windows can be viewed at once.

.H 3 "Using The Mouse"
The mouse can be used to move, resize, and relayer the windows.  It can also
be used to determine which window the keyboard will function with.  All of
these actions are provided in one of two pop-up menus, basic or expanded.
.P
The basic menu appears before the UNIX System V/386 operating system is
installed or initialized.  Once installed, the operating system invokes the
expanded menu during the boot up procedure.  The expanded menu offers
more options and provides a fast method of selecting windows (just point
at the desired window and press any of the mouse buttons).
.P
To select an option from either pop-up menu, do the following:
.AL
.LI
Move the mouse so that the pointer is outside any window.
.LI
Press and hold any one of the mouse buttons.  The menu will appear on
the screen.
.LI
Move the mouse up or down to select an option.  Each option is
highlighted as the pointer passes over it.
.LI
Release the mouse button when the desired option is selected.
.LE
.AB N
The mouse cannot be used to select anything inside of a window
(a file for instance).
.AC
.bp
.H 3 "Basic Menu"
This section explains how to use the selections provided by the basic menu.
.P
The basic menu is shown in Figure A-2.  This menu appears before the
UNIX System V/386 operating system is installed or initialized.  Once
installed, the operating system invokes the expanded menu (explained later).

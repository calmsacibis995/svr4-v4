.CH "Overlay Installation" "3"
.H 1 "Introduction"
An overlay installation reinstalls the System V Release 4 (SVR4) Version 4
operating system on 
a system that already has SVR4 Version 4 installed. An overlay installation saves 
user files and the root password, but does not retain most system and network 
configuration information. The hard disk does not have to be repartitioned in 
an overlay installation; the existing partitioning is used.
.IX "partitioning, hard disk"
.IX "hard disk, partitioning"
.P
If your SVR4 Version 4 system is unusable, you can try to do an overlay installation.
If the filesystem is too corrupted, or if the system is unusable for other
reasons, you must perform a new installation.
.AB N
Before beginning the overlay installation, be sure to remove all
software packages, as described in the "Removing Packages" section of Chapter 1.
.AC
.H 1 "Installation Procedure (Overlay Installation)"
Follow the installation described in this chapter from beginning to end.
The procedure is essentially the same, whether you are installing from
floppy or cartridge tape.
.H 2 "Prepare Target System"
Here are a few steps you should take before
doing an overlay installation.
.AL 
.LI 
If the target system contains any user files that you want to save,
back them up. 
Though user files should not be
overwritten during an overlay installation procedure, it is
still a good precaution to take.
.LI
Back up any desired of your configuration
files. For example, the networking
configuration, password, and spool files may contain
information that is worth saving. 
.LI
Remove all add-on packages.
See the appropriate section in Chapter 1 for instructions.
.LE
.H 2 "Boot from Floppy Diskette"
To boot the system from diskette, do the following: 
.AL
.LI 4
Make sure that power to any externally-powered devices attached to the 
system (such as a monitor) is on.
.LI
Make sure that power to the computer is off. If you already have a UNIX 
system running, shut the UNIX system down (using the \f4shutdown\fP(1M) 
command) before turning off power to the computer. 
.LI
Select boot diskette 1 and insert into the appropriate disk drive.
Because there are different boot diskettes for different types of hardware,
your boot diskette 1 will have one of the following labels on it:
.IX "boot diskettes"
.IX "diskettes, boot"
.BL
.LI
ST506/ESDI Boot Disk 1 of \f2X\f1 
.LI
Adaptec SCSI Boot Disk 1 of \f2X\f1
.LI
Western Digital SCSI Boot Disk 1 of \f2X\f1
.LE
(\f2X\f1 represents the total number of diskettes in the Base System.)
.LI
Turn on power to the computer. 
After a few minutes, the system says:
.SS CO
Booting the system...
.SE
Then, the system performs a memory check and allocates memory to the 
RAM Disk(s.). The system needs at least 4 MB of memory to support the 
RAM Disk, which is used during installation.
.IX "memory, check"
.IX "memory, RAM support"
The system boots from the diskette after the memory check.
.LI
If the system does not reboot, check the following Troubleshooting
tips.
.AB N
The overlay procedure can be aborted at any time by pressing the
.HK DEL
key at any prompt.
If you abort the overlay procedure, you must restart it from the beginning.
.AC
.B "Troubleshooting"
.P
.IX "troubleshooting, boot problems"
.BL
.LI
If the system doesn't boot from the diskette, make sure the diskette 
is in disk drive 0 and reboot the system.
.IX "rebooting the system"
.P
.LI
If you used the wrong boot diskette for your controller, a warning 
message, \f4"Incorrect UNIX System "Base System Package" Floppy
Disk 1"\fP displays. If you get such a warning, remove the 
boot diskette, insert the correct one, then press the
.HK RESET
button. 
If the system still won't boot, the disk drive may be jumpered incorrectly.
Look at the hardware reference manual that came with 
your system to find out how to rejumper the controller. If you need 
help, contact your service representative.
.LI
If you have a non-SCSI cartridge tape controller and drive and you 
see an error message that says, \f4"Cartridge controller was not found 
at address 00000300H. Tape driver is disabled"\fP, it means that the 
tape drive is cabled incorrectly, or the controller is jumpered incorrectly.
.IX "error messages"
.IX "tape drive, cable"
.LI
If the system warns you that more memory is needed, add memory 
before installing the SVR4 software.
.LI
To fix the hardware problems, press 
.HK Del
to abort the installation,
then shut down the system by typing \f4uadmin 2 0\fP. Unplug all 
power cords. Reset the jumpers on the controller, if necessary. Make 
sure the cable to the tape drive is connected correctly. Plug the 
power cords back in, then reboot the system. 
.IX "rebooting the system"
.IX "aborting installation"
.IX "installation, aborting"
.LE
.AB W
Adding memory, reconfiguring the cartridge controller, or 
checking the tape drive cable involves removing the cover on 
the computer. When the cover is open, you are exposed to 
dangerous voltages. To reduce the chance of severe shock, 
unplug the power cords of the computer and all peripherals 
before opening the cover. Only qualified service technicians 
or system integrators should perform these tasks.
.AC
.LI
When prompted to insert the UNIX System "Base System Package" 
Floppy Disk 2, remove the first boot diskette, insert the Base System diskette, and press
.HK EK .
The second diskette contains the basic utilities 
needed to put UNIX on the hard disk.
.IX "diskette, base system"
.P
The system responds:
.SS CO
Checking system configuration...
.SE
The screen may be blank for several minutes as the hard disk is searched to 
see if there are recognizable disk partitions and filesystems on it.
.AB N
If another operating system, such as MS-DOS, is already on part of 
the disk, installing the UNIX Operating System as instructed won't 
destroy that operating system, as long as the UNIX Operating System is
installed on an unused partition.
.AC
If the system is recognized as a UNIX System V, Release 4 system,
after a few minutes, the following displays:
.SS CO
Do you wish to overlay your existing UNIX system (y or n)?
.SE
.AB N
If the above message does not display, it means the system could not 
be identified as a SVR4 system. You must do a new installation 
instead of an overlay. Abort the installation by answering \f4n\fP
and go to Chapter 2.
.AC
If you answer \f4y\f1 to the question, the system does a sanity check.
.sp
.B "Troubleshooting"
.IX "troubleshooting, overlay problems"
.BL
.LI
If the system warns you that an overlay installation can't be done 
and prompts you to strike
.HK EK
to continue with a new installation
or press
.HK Del
to cancel the installation, it means the filesystems
are corrupted, the root or other filesystems can't be mounted, or 
a UNIX operating system is not on the hard disk. Respond as desired.
If you press
.IX "installation, aborting"
.HK Del ,
you can then reboot from the hard disk 
and use the filesystem maintenance tools such as \f4fsck\fP(1M) to try to 
fix the problem. Then, when ready, try the installation again.
.IX "fsck"
.IX "rebooting the system"
.LI
The system may warn you that packages are still installed and
must be removed.
If so, see the description of how to remove
all packages in Chapter 1.
.LE
.LI
If everything is all right, the following message displays:

.SS CO
WARNING:
	A system backup is suggested
	prior to doing a system overlay.

	To proceed with installation strike ENTER,
	otherwise, strike DEL to cancel the installation.

.SE
.LI
If:
.DL
.LI
you did not already back up the files you want to keep, press 
.HK Del ,
shut down the system, reboot the system from the hard 
disk, then back up your files as described in the
.BT "System Administrator's Guide" .
Then restart the installation process.
.IX "rebooting the system"
.LI
you are prepared to overlay the system, press
.HK EK .

.P
Next, you must choose which package sets and packages you want to install.
.H 2 "Selecting Packages"
The software packages are grouped in sets, according to function; BASIC,
NETWORK, EXTENDED, DEVELOPMENT and HARDWARE. You can install an 
entire set, or selectively install packages from each set.
The sets and their corresponding packages are (in the order they are installed, 
if selected):
.IX "packages, BASIC"
.IX "packages, NETWORK"
.IX "packages, EXTENDED"
.IX "packages, DEVELOPMENT"
.IX "packages, HARDWARE"
.BL
.LI
BASIC = ed terminf termcap windowing mouse fmli oam lp acp nsu
.IX "ed package"
.IX "terminfo package"
.IX "termcap package"
.IX "windowing package"
.IX "mouse package"
.IX "fmli package"
.IX "oam package"
.IX "lp package"
.IX "acp package"
.IX "nsu package"
.LI
NETWORK = dfs rpc inet nfs rfs
.IX "inet package"
.IX "dfs package"
.IX "rpc package"
.IX "nfs package"
.IX "rfs package"
.LI
DEVELOPMENT = scde
.IX "scde package"
.LI
EXTENDED = compat face
.IX "compat package"
.IX "face package"
.LI
HARDWARE = wd imx586 ie6 qt
.IX "ie6 package"
.IX "qt package"
.IX "wd package"
.IX "imx586 package"
.LE
.AB N
If you have a SCSI system, the \f4qt\fP tape driver package is not listed 
in the HARDWARE set.
.AC
Before selecting the packages you want to install, make note of the following:
.BL
.LI
The base operating system and all the packages that make up the UNIX Operating System
use about 100 MB of memory. The DOS partition (if desired), and the optional
user slices (home, home2, tmp, etc.) must be sized accordingly. If your 
hard disk is only 80 MB, you cannot install all the packages. Table A-1 in 
Appendix A shows the minimum required disk space needed to install the 
various packages.
.IX "optional slices"
.IX "DOS, partition"
.IX "partition, DOS"
.IX "memory, 100 MB"
.IX "hard disk, 80 MB"
.LI
If your hard disk is smaller than 320 MB and you want to install all the 
packages, you may not be able to create all the optional slices you desire. 
Read Appendix B,
.CT "Selecting Optional Slices" ,
and plan your disk layout before beginning.
.IX "hard disk, planning layout"
.IX "hard disk, 320 MB"
.IX "optional slices, selecting"
.LI
When selecting the Hardware Set packages, install only one Ethernet
driver package - the one for which you have corresponding hardware.
.IX "Ethernet, driver packages"
.LE
.H 3 "The Package Selection Questions"
The first question asked about the package selection is as follows:
.SS CO

This appendix tells you how to use the \f4ADD.base.pkg\fP
command to install packages from the UNIX Operating System tape after you have
installed the system, and how to
use the \f4pkgadd\fP command to install other packages
from tape or diskette.
.IX "ADD.base.pkg command"
.IX "packages, installing"
.IX "pkgadd command"
.AB N
To install optional or add-on packages, the base operating system 
must already be installed.

System V Release 3.2 packages must be installed using the 
\f4installpkg\fP command.

If you are installing a new version of a package that is on your 
system, you must use \f4pkgrm\fP to remove the old version of the package 
first. See
.ST "Removing Packages"
.IX "pkgrm command"
in Chapter 4 for instructions.

.H 1 "Installing UNIX System Packages From Tape"
To install a UNIX System package from the tape, do the following:
.IX "packages, UNIX System"
.IX "UNIX System packages"
.AL 1
.LI
Decide which packages you want to install. See Appendix A for a description of
the packages that are on the UNIX System tape.
.LI
Look at Table A-1 in Appendix A to see how much disk space is required for 
each package.
.LI
If your system does not have enough disk space for all the packages you 
want to install, add a bigger hard disk or install fewer packages.
.LI
If selectively installing the packages, look at Table A-1 in Appendix A to 
find out which packages depend on other packages. If a package depends on 
another package, the package shown in the Dependencies column must be
installed first. For example, if you are installing the \f4oam\fP package, also
install the \f4fmli\fP package.
.IX "packages, selecting"
.IX "packages, dependencies"
.LI
Log in as root.
.LI
Type \f4pkginfo\fP to see which packages are already installed on your system.
.IX "pkginfo command"
.LI
Insert the UNIX System tape cartridge into the tape drive.
.LI
Begin the install process by typing:
.DS
.ft 4
/usr/lbin/ADD.base.pkg
.ft 1
.IX "ADD.base.pkg command"

The system asks:
.SS CO
The BASIC Package Set contains the following packages:
	(ed) Editing Package
	(terminf) Remote Terminal Package
	(termcap) AT&T Termcap Compatibility Package
	(windowing) AT&T Windowing Utilities
	(mouse)  Mouse Driver Package
	(fmli)  AT&T Form and Menu Language Interpreter
	(oam)  Operations, Administration, and Maintenance
	(lp)  LP Print Service
	(acp) Application Compatibility Package
	(nsu) Network Support Utilities
Do you wish to install any of these packages (default n):

.LI
Select the desired package sets and the desired packages, as described in 
the section
.ST "Selecting Packages"
in Chapter 2 or 3.
.AB N
Remember to specify any prerequisite packages that are required.
.AC
.LI
When shown a summary of the packages you selected, accept the selection 
shown, or type \f4n\fP and reselect the packages.
.sp
The system begins to ask you questions regarding the packages you
selected. See Appendix C for a description of all the questions and any
required answers.
.LI
Answer the questions. After you answer the questions,
the packages begin to install.
.LI
If prompted to reboot the system after the packages have installed, make 
sure the disk drive is empty, then press
.HK Ctrl-Alt-Del .
.sp
The system shuts down and automatically reboots. When the login 
prompt displays, you can use the system.

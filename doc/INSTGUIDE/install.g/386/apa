.H 1 "Introduction"
The following sections describe the function of the base operating system and 
optional packages. The packages are described in the order they install.
The media on which the software is delivered is described in Chapter 1.
Table A-1 shows how much disk space is
required to install the desired packages and which packages depend on other 
packages.
.AB N
If you aren't sure which packages to install and your hard disk is 
larger than 170 MB, you can install all the packages (except for the 
HARDWARE Package Set packages) and remove any unwanted 
packages later. It is easier to install packages during the initial
installation than to install the package later.
To find out about package dependencies and the disk space required 
to install add-on packages that are sold separately,
see the documentation that came with the add-on 
package.

Before installing packages, look at Table A-1 and determine how much disk

If you selectively install packages, you must first install all packages that a 
package depends on (as shown in the table's right column) before installing the 
package.

.CH "Package Installation Question Summary" "C"
.H 1 "Introduction"
This appendix shows you the questions asked by the various packages during 
.IX "packages, installation questions"
installation from diskette or tape. Any time a \f4?\fP appears
when you are 
asked for input, you can type \f4?\fP for a help message.
If a specific answer is
required, you are told what it should be, or where to find the answers.
Press
.HK EK
to accept the default shown.
.P
The questions shown must be answered before installation continues.
The system may ask other questions not shown here.
If you give an incorrect response to a question, the installation
of the package may quit, or you may be asked for input again.
For example, if you assign the same memory address or interrupt number
to several controllers, you will be warned of a conflict.
You will also be given the choice of either aborting the installation
of the package or reassigning the memory address or
interrupt and continuing.
.P
We advise you to read this appendix and prepare your answers before continuing.
.H 1 "BASIC Package Set Questions"
The following questions are asked when you specify that you want to install 
packages from the BASIC package set:
.H 3 "Terminal Information Utilities (terminf) Package"
.IX "terminf package"
When the \f4terminf\fP package installs, the system asks:
.SS CO
Do you wish to install all the terminfo files: (default: y)
.SE
If there will be unknown numbers and types of terminals attached to your
system, or if modems or dumb terminals may access your system,
install all the \f4terminfo\fP files.
If only one terminal will be attached to your system or hard disk 
space is tight, do not install all the \f4terminfo\fP files. Respond as desired.
.AB N
Installing all the entries takes up about 1 MB of disk space. If you 
run out of disk space later, you can remove the unneeded entries by 
removing the files in the subdirectories under the 
\f4/usr/share/lib/terminfo\fP subdirectories.
.sp
If the file is symbolically linked, be sure to also remove the file to 
which the entry is linked. To find out if a file is linked,
type \f4ls -l\fP.
If a file is linked, the far left column has the letter "l" for linked. 
The far right column has the symbol ->, followed by a pathname. 
This is the file's link.
.AC
The files will be installed and compiled.
.AB N
A message displays that says some files are being removed.
The system is de-installing files it used to compile the terminfo entries. 
This is normal.
.AC
.H 3 "Mouse Driver (mouse) Package"
.IX "mouse package"
The questions you are asked when the mouse driver packages install are as
follows:
.SS CO
The Mouse Driver Package provides drivers to support 
three different types of mice:

Logitech bus mouse
Logitech serial mouse
PS/2 compatible mouse

You can install one or more mouse drivers on your system.
If you only plan to use one mouse with your system,
answer 'y' to the appropriate question below. 
If you plan to switch mice at some point, you may want 
to install more than one mouse driver
(See mouseadmin(1) for information on how to reconfigure 
the mice in your system).

Below, answer 'y' for those mice you have or are 
planning to use and 'n' for those you do not require 
support for.

In order to use a PS/2 compatible mouse (e.g. AT&T 320 mouse),
your hardware needs a PS/2 mouse port.
Check your hardware reference manual to be sure you have the 
necessary hardware support if you plan to use a PS/2 compatible mouse.
.SE
.AB N
If you answer \f4n\fP to the next three questions, no mice are installed.
.AC
If you don't know which type of mouse you will be using, answer \f4y\fP to
the next three questions.
.SS CO
Will you be using a PS2 compatible mouse (e.g. AT&T mouse)?
(default: n) [y, n, ?, q]
.SE
Answer as desired.

then go to the next section about using \f4mouseadmin\fP interactively. 
.IX "mouseadmin command"
.P
If you say \f4y\fP, the system asks:
.SS CO

(default: tty00) [?, q]
.SE
.H 3 "Using mouseadmin Interactively"
If you did not set up the configuration file when asked, as shown on the
previous page, when the \f4mouse\fP package installs, the system checks to see if 
the configuration file is set up. If it isn't, you are asked if you want to run 
\f4mouseadmin\fP interactively. If you say \f4y\fP, you are asked the following
questions about half hour into the package installation process:
.SS CO
There are no mice assigned.

Select one of the following:

B)us mouse add
P)S2 mouse add
S)erial mouse add
U)pdate mouse configuration and quit

.SE
Type the desired response. If the mouse is connected to port COMM1, type 
\f4tty00\fP. If the mouse is connected to port COMM2, type \f4tty01\fP.
.P
The system responds:
.SS CO
Select one of the following:

B)us mouse add
P)S2 mouse add
S)erial mouse add
U)pdate mouse configuration and quit
E)xit (no update)
Enter selection:
.SE
Type \f4U\fP to update the mouse configuration.
.AB N
If you ever need to reconfigure (delete) a mouse, use the \f4mouseadmin\fP
command.
See the \f4mouseadmin\fP(1) man page in the
.BT "System Administrator's Reference Manual" .
.AC
.H 3 "Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OA&M) Package"
When the \f4oam\fP (Operations, Administration, and Maintenance) package
.IX "oam package"
installation begins, the system says:
.SS CO
You are about to install the Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OA&M)
user interface.

The BASIC user interface provides a concise set of tools for basic system
administration. This will help you conserve disk space.

The EXTENDED user interface provides extensions to the 
BASIC interface and access to the full OA&M feature set.
BASIC installs automatically if you choose EXTENDED.

Do you wish to install both the BASIC and EXTENDED 
portions of the OA&M user interface?
(default: y) [y, n, ?, q]
.SE

Next, you are told to set a password for your OA&M (\f4sysadm\fP) login.
Enter the desired password and keep it secure.
.H 3 "Line Printer Spooler (lp) Package"
.IX "lp package"
When you install the \f4lp\fP (Line Printer Spooler) package, the following
messages display:
.SS CO
Examining your system to see if you have the old LP Spooler Utilities.

All users? (default: y) [y, n, ?, q]
.SE
Respond as desired.
Answering \f4y\fP means all users can disable/enable the printer.
Answering \f4n\fP means only root can disable/enable the printer.
.P
The system then asks:
.SS CO
Will you be attaching a PostScript printer to this system?
(default: y) [y, n, ?, q]
.SE
Answer as desired.

Answer as desired.
.P
The system responds:
.SS CO
Enter the number of pseudo-terminal devices to configure on your system
(default: 16) [0-256, ?, q]
.SE

To prevent unauthorized users from invoking the kernel debugger,
KDB provides optional security checks which cause attempts
to enter the kernel from a console key sequence to be rejected. Even with
these security checks enabled, you can still invoke the debugger with the
"kdb" command, which requires super-user privilege.
Also, the debugger will still be entered as a result of a kernel panic.

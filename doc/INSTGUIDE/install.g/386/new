.BK "Installation Guide" "System V Release 4"
.CH "New Installation" "2"
.H 1 "Introduction"
This chapter describes how to install the
UNIX System V, Release 4 operating system on
your system's hard disk.
(Make sure you have done the Pre-Installation Tasks described in Chapter 1
before you begin the installation described in this chapter.)
.P
The installation procedure will completely remove
the previous UNIX Operating system, its file systems, and
any files you stored in those file systems.
If you prefer to overlay your operating system,
without destroying user files, see Chapter 3.
It will tell you the cases in which a non-destructive,
overlay installation is possible.
.P
The procedure in this chapter assumes you have already
done the prerequisite steps described in Chapter 1.
Make sure you read that chapter before beginning
installation.
.H 1 "Installation Procedure (New Installation)"
Follow the installation described in this chapter from beginning to end.
The procedure is essentially the same, whether you are installing from
diskette or cartridge tape.
.H 2 "Boot from Diskette"
To boot the system from diskette, do the following: 
.AL
.LI
Make sure that power to any externally-powered devices attached to the 
system (such as a monitor) is on.
.LI
Make sure that power to the computer is off. If you already have a UNIX 
system running, shut the UNIX system down (using the \f4shutdown\fP(1M) 
command) before turning off power to the computer. 
.LI
Select boot diskette 1 and insert it into the appropriate disk drive.
Because there are different boot diskettes for different types of hardware,
your boot diskette 1 will have one of the following labels on it:
.IX "boot diskettes"
.IX "diskettes, boot"
.BL
.LI
ST506/ESDI Boot Disk 1 of \f2X\f1 
.LI
Adaptec SCSI Boot Disk 1 of \f2X\f1
.LI
Western Digital SCSI Boot Disk 1 of \f2X\f1
.LE
(\f2X\f1 represents the total number of diskettes in the Base System.)
.LI
Turn on power to the computer. 
After a few minutes, the system says:
.SS CO
Booting the system...
.SE
Then, the system performs a memory check and allocates memory to the 
RAM Disk(s.). The system needs at least 4 MB of memory to support the 
RAM Disk, which is used during installation.
The system boots from the diskette after the memory check.
.IX "memory, check"
.IX "memory, RAM support"
.LI
If the system does not reboot, check the following Troubleshooting
tips:
.DS I
.B "Troubleshooting"
.P
.IX "troubleshooting, boot problems"
.BL
.LI
If the system doesn't boot from the diskette, make sure the diskette 
is in disk drive 0 and reboot the system.
.IX "rebooting the system"
.P
.LI
If you used the wrong boot diskette for your controller, a warning 
message, \f4"Incorrect UNIX System "Base System Package" Floppy
Disk 1"\fP displays. If you get such a warning, remove the 
boot diskette, insert the correct one, then press the
RESET button. 
If the system still won't boot, the disk drive may be jumpered incorrectly.
Look at the hardware reference manual that came with 
your system to find out how to rejumper the controller. If you need 
help, contact your service representative.
.LI
If you have a non-SCSI cartridge tape controller and drive and you 
see an error message that says, \f4"Cartridge controller was not found 
at address 00000300H. Tape driver is disabled"\fP, it means that the 
tape drive is cabled incorrectly, or the controller is jumpered incorrectly.
.IX "error messages"
.IX "tape drive, cable"
.LI
If the system warns you that more memory is needed, add memory 
before installing the SVR4 software.
.LI
To fix the hardware problems, press 
.HK Del
to abort the installation,
then shut down the system by typing \f4uadmin 2 0\fP. Unplug all 
power cords. Reset the jumpers on the controller, if necessary. Make 
sure the cable to the tape drive is connected correctly. Plug the 
power cords back in, then reboot the system. 
.IX "rebooting the system"
.DE
.IX "aborting installation"
.IX "installation, aborting"
.LE
.AB W
Adding memory, reconfiguring the cartridge controller, or 
checking the tape drive cable involves removing the cover on 
the computer. When the cover is open, you are exposed to 
dangerous voltages. To reduce the chance of severe shock, 
unplug the power cords of the computer and all peripherals 
before opening the cover. Only qualified service technicians 
or system integrators should perform these tasks.
.AC
.LI
When prompted to insert the UNIX System "Base System Package" 
Floppy Disk 2, remove the first boot diskette, insert the Base System diskette, and press
.HK EK .
The second diskette contains the basic utilities 
needed to put UNIX on the hard disk.
.IX "diskette, base system"
.P
The system responds:
.SS CO
Checking system configuration...
.SE
The screen may be blank for several minutes as the hard disk is searched to 
see if there are recognizable disk partitions and filesystems on it. What
displays next depends on which version of UNIX is on the disk, or whether the 
hard disk was blank.
.AB N
If another operating system, such as MS-DOS, is already on part of 
the disk, installing the UNIX Operating System as instructed won't 
destroy that operating system, as long as the UNIX Operating System is
installed on an unused partition.
.AC
If your system has pre-Release 4 UNIX on it, the following message displays
(if your system has SVR4 on it, skip the next step):
.SS CO
Checking system configuration ...

will destroy all files currently on the system.
Do you wish to continue (y or n)? 
.SE
.LI
If you have already saved any desired files, type \f4y\fP, then skip to the next 
section on selecting packages.
.AB N
If you haven't already backed up your files, type \f4n\fP, shut down and 
reboot the system, then back up your files (as described in Chapter 1).
Then begin the installation again.
.AC
.IX "rebooting the system"
If your system has SVR4 UNIX on it, the following message displays:
.SS CO

Next, you must choose which package sets and packages you want to install.
.H 2 "Selecting Packages"
The software packages are grouped in sets, according to function; BASIC,
NETWORK, EXTENDED, DEVELOPMENT and HARDWARE. You can install an 
entire set, or selectively install packages from each set.
The sets and their corresponding packages are (in the order they are installed, 
if selected):
.IX "packages, BASIC"
.IX "packages, NETWORK"
.IX "packages, EXTENDED"
.IX "packages, DEVELOPMENT"
.IX "packages, HARDWARE"
.BL
.LI
BASIC = ed terminf termcap windowing mouse fmli oam lp acp nsu
.IX "ed package"
.IX "terminf package"

.IX "nsu package"
.LI
NETWORK = dfs rpc inet nfs rfs
.IX "dfs package"
.IX "rpc package"
.IX "inet package"
.IX "nfs package"
.IX "rfs package"
.LI
DEVELOPMENT = scde
.IX "scde package"
.LI
EXTENDED = compat face
.IX "compat package"
.IX "face package"
.LI
HARDWARE = wd imx586 ie6 qt 
.IX "wd package"
.IX "imx586 package"
.IX "ie6 package"
.IX "qt package"
.LE
.AB N
If you have a SCSI system, the \f4qt\fP tape driver package is not listed 
in the HARDWARE set.
.AC
Before selecting the packages you want to install, make note of the following:
.BL
.LI
The base operating system and all the packages that make up the UNIX Operating System
use about 100 MB of memory. The DOS partition (if desired), and the optional
user slices (home, home2, tmp, etc.) must be sized accordingly. If your 
hard disk is only 80 MB, you cannot install all the packages. Table A-1 in 
Appendix A shows the minimum required disk space needed to install the 
various packages.
.IX "optional slices"
.IX "DOS, partition"
.IX "partition, DOS"
.IX "memory, 100 MB"
.IX "hard disk, 80 MB"
.LI
If your hard disk is smaller than 320 MB and you want to install all the 
packages, you may not be able to create all the optional slices you desire. 
Read Appendix B,
.CT "Selecting Optional Slices" ,
and plan your disk layout before beginning.
.IX "hard disk, planning layout"
.IX "hard disk, 320 MB"
.IX "optional slices, selecting"
.LI
When selecting the Hardware Set packages, install only one Ethernet
driver package - the one for which you have corresponding hardware.
.IX "Ethernet, driver packages"
.LE
.H 3 "The Package Selection Questions"
The first question asked about the package selection is as follows:
.SS CO
The BASIC Package Set contains the following packages:
	(ed) Editing Package
	(terminf) Remote Terminal Package
	(termcap) AT&T Termcap Compatibility Package
	(windowing) AT&T Windowing Utilities
	(mouse)  Mouse Driver Package
	(fmli)  AT&T Form and Menu Language Interpreter
	(oam)  Operations, Administration, and Maintenance
	(lp)  LP Print Service
	(acp) Application Compatibility Package
	(nsu) Network Support Utilities
Do you wish to install any of these packages (default n): \s0
.SE
.AL 1
.LI 10
Answer as desired. If you press
.HK EK
to accept the default, you are 
asked if you want to install the next package set (the NETWORK set). If 
you answer \f4y\fP to the previous question, the system asks:
.SS CO
Install all packages? (default y):
.SE
You can install all the packages, or selectively install them.
.LI
To install all the packages in the set, press 
.HK EK .
.IX "packages, installing"
You are then asked about the next package set. Respond as desired.
.LI
To selectively install the packages, type \f4n\fP .
.IX "packages, selecting"
.sp
The system asks you one-by-one if you want to install the packages
in the set. Respond as desired.
.LI
After you answer the questions about one package set, the system asks about 
the next package set. Repeat the required steps.
.P
When you have finished selecting packages, a summary of the packages you 
selected displays. For example:
.SS CO
Current Package Selections:
BASIC:

	Editing Package
	Terminal Information Utilities
	Termcap Compatibility Package
	AT&T Windowing Utilities

	Intel Ethernet Driver
	IE6 (3C503) Ethernet Driver
	Cartridge Tape Utilities


Are these Correct (default n):
.SE
.LI
To change the selection, press
.HK EK .
The first question about the package sets redisplays and you are cycled through the entire selection process 
again.
.LI
To accept the summary, type \f4y\fP.
.LE
Next, you must partition the hard disk for the desired operating systems.
.H 2 "Partitioning the Hard Disk"
Partitioning the hard disk involves specifying the desired operating 
systems (for example, DOS and UNIX), and specifying the percentage of 
hard disk space to allocate for each operating system. If your system has 
two hard disks, you can install portions of the base operating system on both 
hard disks. This leaves more space for file systems on the primary hard 
disk.
.IX "partition, UNIX"
.IX "hard disk, primary"
.IX "hard disk, partitioning"
.IX "disk space, allocating"
.P
The system expects you to partition the second disk right after partitioning 
the primary hard disk. However, if the second hard disk contains data 
that you do not want to destroy, or if you want to manually create your own 
filesystems on the second hard disk later, you can partition the second hard 
disk using the \f4diskadd\fP(1M) command, described in the
.BT "System Administrator's Reference Manual".
.IX "filesystem"
.IX "diskadd command"
.IX "hard disk, secondary"
.AB N
All information in this section, unless noted, applies to both one- 
and two-hard drive systems. Hard disks are referred to as disk 0 
(the primary disk) and disk 1 (the secondary disk). If you have only 
one disk, it is called disk 0. Screen messages refer to disk 0 or 1, as 
appropriate.
.IX "disk, 0"
.IX "disk, 1"
.AC
If your system has two hard disk drives, the following message displays right 
after you finish selecting the packages to install (If your system has only one 
hard disk, skip two steps):
.SS CO
This system is equipped with two hard disk drives that can be 
used for installation of the UNIX system.
You can elect to install the entire UNIX system on the 
primary hard disk or to install some of the UNIX system 
components onto the secondary hard disk, allowing you, for 
example, to create a larger root file system on the primary.

The next step will create partition(s) on your hard disk(s). 
Even if you partition both hard disks now, you may still 
elect to install the UNIX system just on the primary hard disk.

Do you wish to partition both hard disks at this time (y or n)?
.SE
.AL 1
.LI 16
If desired, type \f4y\fP. 
.sp
The system then says:
.SS CO
Please strike ENTER when ready or DEL to cancel the 
installation.
.SE
.LI
Press
.HK EK .
.LI
When the system responds with the following, press
.HK EK
to continue the installation:
.SS CO
If you wish to use part of your hard disk for other 
operating system(s) other than the UNIX System, such 
as MS-DOS, that space MUST be reserved now.

Please strike ENTER when ready or DEL to cancel the 
installation:
.SE
If the disk didn't have an operating system installed on it,
the system will recommend a default partitioning for your disk.
If your disk does have an operating system installed,
the current or default partitioning displays, followed by the following 
screen:
.SS CO
.TS

SELECT ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:

1. Create a partition
2  Change active (Boot from) partition
3  Delete a partition
4  Exit (Update disk configuration and exit)
5  Cancel (Exit without updating disk configuration)

Enter selection:
.SE
You can now change the partitioning shown, or accept the default.
.LI
To change the partitioning, follow the system prompts. First delete any
existing UNIX partition, then create the new partition(s).
.IX "partitioning, changing the default"
.P
When partitioning the hard disk, remember the following:
.BL
.LI
The total of all the partitions can't equal more than 100% of the hard 
disk.
.LI
If your hard disk is only 80 MB, you should probably remove any existing 
DOS partition. Removing the DOS partition destroys any DOS system
on the disk.
.IX "DOS, partition"
.IX "active partition"
.IX "partition, active"
.IX "partition, DOS"
.LI
If you want a DOS partition, it must be partition one and it cannot be
designated as the active partition (the partition from which the operating 
system boots) until after the UNIX installation is done.
.LI
If you will be using DOS Merge and your disk is larger than 120 MB, we 
.IX "DOS, Merge"
.IX "partition, DOS"
recommend that you create a 32 MB DOS partition.
.LE
.LI
To accept the default partitioning, type \f45\f1 (cancel).
Or, after changing the partitioning the way you want, 
update the disk configuration by typing \f44\fP (update and exit)
when the above screen is
displayed.
.LE
.H 2 "Selecting the Filesystem Types for Required Filesystems"
Once the hard disk has been partitioned, you must select the filesystem 
type for the required filesystems or slices. The following message displays:
.SS CO
You have allocated nnn megabytes to the UNIX Operating 
System.

The following hard disk elements are required and must 
reside on your primary (disk 0) hard disk:
Drive   Name               Type        File System/Slice
----    ----               ----        ----------------
0       Boot File System   bfs           /stand
0       Swap Slice                       /dev/swap
0       Root File System   ufs, s5, s52k /

Please select the File System Type for Root File System (/)
from the following list:
s5, ufs, s52k default(s5):
.SE
.AL
.LI 21
Select the desired filesystem type for the root filesystem.
If you are in doubt, use \f4s5\f1.
The choices are:
.VL .5i
.LI "s5"
This is the traditional UNIX System V file system type.
Its advantage is that it has been around a long time and is proven reliable.
It allows 14-character file names and handles data in 1024-byte blocks.
If you will deal with mostly small files, an s5 file system will save space.
.LI "ufs"
Before being incorporated into System V, Release 4, this file system was
traditionally just on Berkeley UNIX systems.
It allows file names up to 255 characters long and uses 8192-byte block sizes.
If you need long file names or are dealing with data base storage of
large files, you may want to use this file system type.
.LI "s52k"
This file system type is just an s5 file system type with a logical
block size of 2K.
If most files on the system are about 2K logical blocks in size, this
would be the best choice for fast accessing and efficient use of disk space.
.IX "filesystem, ufs type"

.H 2 "Selecting Optional Disk Slices"
.IX "optional slices, selecting"
.IX "slices, selecting optional"
The first question about the optional slices appears:
.SS CO
Do you wish to create any optional disk slices or 
filesystems (y or n)?
.SE
Before deciding, note the following:
.BL
.LI
None of the optional slices are needed to run SVR4 UNIX. 
.LI
The optional disk slices or filesystems can be installed on the primary disk 
(disk 0) or secondary disk (disk 1).
.LI
If your hard disk is 140 MB or smaller, we recommend that you do not create 
any optional slices (except for \f4/dev/dump\fP, if desired).
.IX "/dev/dump"

A summary of the selected layout displays.
The summary looks similar to 
the following:
.SS CO
The Hard disk layout you have selected is:

Is this correct (y or n)
.SE
.LI
If the layout shown is acceptable, type \f4y\fP.
If the layout is unacceptable, type \f4n\fP.
.sp
(If you type \f4n\fP, you are again asked to select a
filesystem as described in the previous section.
When the layout is correct, type \f4y\fP.)
.LE
.H 2 "Surface Analysis"
.IX "surface analysis, SCSI"
If you have a SCSI system, the system asks the following:
.SS CO
Surface analysis of your hard disk is recommended but 
not required.
Do you wish to skip surface analysis? (y/n)
.SE
.AL 1
.LI 24
Since surface analysis is not necessary, type \f4y\fP.

.H 2 "Recommended Disk Configuration"
Next, the system displays the recommended disk configuration (the recommended
sizes for the filesystems/slices). For example, the system displays the 
following (the numbers differ depending on your hard disk size, the 
amount of RAM, and the slices that were created):
.IX "disk, default configuration"
.SS CO
The following slice sizes are the recommended 
configuration for your disk.
A / filesystem of 664 cylinders (99.2 MB)
A /dev/swap slice of 108 cylinders (16.1 MB)
A /stand filesystem of 34 cylinders (5.1 MB)

Is this configuration acceptable? (y/n)
.SE
.AL 1

tape, it means the tape drive is incorrectly cabled, or the tape controller
is incorrectly jumpered. If the tape controller is jumpered 
wrong, the error message also says that the streaming tape should 
be on host adaptor Slot=0, Target ID=3.

To continue the installation without making any changes to the 
hardware, type \f4INSTALL\fP. Then go to the first question
in the beginning of this chapter.
.P
To fix the hardware problems, shut down the system by typing 
\f4uadmin 2 0\fP. Unplug all power cords. Reset the jumpers on the controller,
if necessary. Look at the hardware reference manual that 
came with your system to find out how to reset the jumpers. Make 
sure the cable to the tape drive is connected correctly. Plug the power
cords back in and turn on power to the computer. The system comes 
back up, and the first question in this chapter repeats. 
.IX "shutdown"
.LE
.AB W
Reconfiguring the tape controller or checking the tape drive 
cable involves removing the cover on the base unit. When the 
cover is open, you are exposed to dangerous voltages. To reduce 
the chance of severe shock, unplug the power cords of the base 
unit and all peripherals before opening the base unit cover. Only 
qualified service technicians or system integrators should perform these tasks.

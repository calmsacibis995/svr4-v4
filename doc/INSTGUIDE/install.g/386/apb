.CH "Selecting Optional Slices" "B"
.H 1 "Introduction"
Once you decide to create optional slices, make note of the following before
selecting the slices:
.IX "optional slices, creating"
.BL
.LI
When installing optional slices, the slices the system offers you depends on 
the amount of space available on the partition.
.LI
If the UNIX partition size is smaller than 140 MB, the system offers
\f4/usr\fP, \f4/home\fP, \f4/dev/dump\fP, and \f4/var\fP.
If the partition is larger than 140 MB, the 
system also offers \f4/home2\fP and \f4/tmp\fP.
.IX "/usr"
.IX "/var"
.IX "/home"
.IX "/dev/dump"
.IX "/home2"
.IX "/tmp"
.LI
All packages and user-added executables are usually placed in the \f4/\fP or 
\f4/usr\fP directories. Do not create a separate \f4/usr\fP slice.
It is no longer
necessary, since most log files and spooling areas are now under the \f4/var\fP 
directory, instead of the \f4/usr\fP directory.
.LE
.H 1 "Selecting Optional Slices"
After telling the system that you want to create optional slices,
the system asks:
.SS CO
Create a slice for/<slice> (y or n)?
.SE
.AL 1
.LI
Answer \f4y\fP or \f4n\fP, as desired. If you say \f4n\fP,
the slice is installed as a directory
in the root filesystem.
.IX "filesystem, root"
.IX "root filesystem"
.AB N
The root file system must be large enough to
accommodate these directories.
.sp
The system may offer a slice for which there is no room. If so, you 
are informed of the problem later in the installation.
.AC
.P
When installing the \f4/usr\fP, \f4/home\fP, \f4/var\fP, \f4/home2\fP,
or \f4/tmp\fP slices, the system 
says: 
.LI
To specify the ufs filesystem type, press
.IX "filesystem, ufs type"
.IX "filesystem, s5 type"
.IX "filesystem, s52k type"
.HK EK .
Otherwise, type \f4s5\fP or 
\f4s52k\fP.
.LI
If you have two hard disk drives, you must answer the following question (If 
you only have one disk drive, skip this step):
.IX "hard disk, formatting two"
.SS CO
Please select the drive upon which you wish to install
<filesystem> (0 or 1)?
.SE
Specify on which drive you want the slice installed.
.LI
When the system has offered all the slices it is going to, a summary of the 
layout you selected displays. Return to Chapter 2, in the section 
.ST "Selecting Optional Disk Slices" .
.LE
.H 2 "Determining if the Default Configuration is Correct"
Before accepting the default disk configuration (displayed after you 
create optional slices), do the following:
.BL
.LI
Make sure each slice and filesystem has at least the minimum size recommended,
as shown in Table B-1. If used, each slice must have as much space 
as shown in the table.
.IX "filesystem, minimum sizes"

/var*20 MB
/tmp*5 MB
.TE
.DE
.LI
For each filesystem that you do not install (such as \f4var\fP and \f4tmp\fP),
increase the size of root proportionately. For example, if you do not
install \f4/tmp\fP, you 
can increase root by the 5 MB of space which would have been allocated to 
\f4/tmp\fP. Since the \f4/home2\fP filesystem has nothing installed in it,
if you don't install the \f4/home2\fP filesystem, do not increase the size
of root proportionately to the size of \f4/home2\fP.
.IX "root filesystem"
.IX "filesystem, root"
.LI
If \f4/dev/dump\fP is installed, it must be equal in size to the available
memory in your system. It can be larger than available memory.
For example, if you 
know you are going to expand your system's memory in the future, you can 
specify the size of \f4/dev/dump\fP to match the larger memory capacity.
.IX "/dev/dump"
.LI
.IX "swap"
The swap device is typically equal to twice the size of available memory 
(unless large amounts of memory are present). Also, swap may be made larger,
depending on your needs. 
.LI
If you are going to install many packages, consider configuring more than the 
minimum required disk space for the \f4/usr\fP and \f4/var\fP file systems
(if installed).
.IX "/usr"
.IX "/var"
.LI
If your hard disk is between 170 and 320 MB, \f4/ \fP(root) should be at least
120 
MB. If the drive is 760 MB, \f4root\fP should be about 200 MB.

.IX "filesystem, root"

.\" If you choose to install the graphics packages, and the packages in the
.\" NETWORKING, and DEVELOPMENT package sets,
.\" the \f4root\fP or \f4root\fP and \f4/usr\fP combination should be a minimum of
.\" 100-120 MB.

If the default configuration is acceptable, type \f4y\fP. Otherwise, go to 
the next section for instructions.

If you see the following warning message, it means the system does 
not have enough room to configure all of the selected slices into the 
partition:
.IX "error messages"
.SS CO
Based on the default size recommendations, disk space 
was not available for the following slices:
The /home filesystem.
The /var filesystem.

Is this configuration acceptable? (y/n)
.SE
If you want to install the filesystems for which there was no room, 
don't accept the configuration, and go to the next section for instructions. 
.LE
.in -1.5i
.H 2 "Changing the Recommended Configuration"
To change the recommended disk configuration, do the following:
.IX "configuration, changing"
.IX "disk, default configuration"
.AL 1
.LI
Type \f4n\fP.
.sp
The system responds:
.SS CO
You will now specify the size in cylinders of each 
slice. (One megabyte of disk space is approximately 
<n> cylinders.) 

The recommended size for the <slice> slice is <no.> 
cylinders. How many of the remaining cylinders would 
you like for <slice> <0 - xxx>? 
.SE
.LI
Make note of how many megabytes per cylinder are shown in the above message.
The ratio is different depending on the disk type. 
.LI
Use Table B-1 to decide how the disk space should be divided. Specify how 
many cylinders you want for the slice in question. 
.IX "disk space, allocating"
.AB N
The default cylinder size is 0, so if you press
.HK EK
without entering
a number, a size of 0 cylinders is assumed and the slice is deleted 
from the list. If you do this accidentally, when the configuration 
summary is shown and you are asked the question shown below, answer \f4n\fP.
You can then start over with Step 1.
.AC
.P
After specifying the size of the slices, a summary of the disk layout
displays again and you are asked,
.SS CO
Is this configuration acceptable (y or n)?
.SE
.LI
When the configuration is acceptable, answer \f4y\fP, then continue.
.IX "disk, accepting the default"
.P
After the configuration has been accepted, the system automatically creates 
the filesystems on the hard disk. Return to the section
.ST "Creating Filesystems" 
in Chapter 2 to continue.

This appendix describes how to make a copy of the boot and base system
.IX "boot diskettes, copying"
.IX "diskettes, copying boot"
diskettes for backup purposes. A running UNIX Release 4 system is required
to do this copy procedure. We recommend that you make backup copies.
.P
The procedure is to copy the contents of the diskette onto the hard disk, then 
copy them from the hard disk onto another diskette. The following steps outline the procedure:
.AB N
The boot and installation diskettes are write-protected, either 
with tabs (5.25 inch diskettes) or sliding widgets (3.5 inch diskettes).
Do not write-enable the diskettes.
.AC
.AL 1
.LI
Insert the diskette to be copied into drive 0.
.LI
Change directories to the directory where you want the data copied. 
.LI
Copy the contents of the diskette to a file in the current directory by typing:
.DS
.ft 4
dd if=/dev/rdsk/f0t of=disk.xxx bs=15360
.ft 1
.DE
where xxx is a different extension for each diskette you are copying.
.LI
Remove the diskette from the drive.
.LI
Insert a similarly formatted, write-enabled diskette into drive 0.
.LI
To copy the file in the current directory to the diskette, type:
.DS
.ft 4
dd if=disk.xxx of=/dev/rdsk/f0t bs=15360
.ft 1
.DE
where xxx is a different extension for each disk you are copying.
.LI
When this is done, remove the diskette and write-protect it, then label it.
.LI
Repeat Steps 1 through 7 for as many diskettes as you want to copy.

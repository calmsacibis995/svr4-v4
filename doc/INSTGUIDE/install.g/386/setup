Using the OA&M interface
.LI
Other Ways to use OA&M
.LI
Setting the system date and time
.LI
Adding Users to the System
.LI
Restoring files
.LI
Setting up a local area network (LAN)
.LI
Backing up the system
.LI
Removing packages
.LI
Shutting the system down
.LE
.P
Most of the tasks are described are done via the Operations, Administration, 
and Maintenance (OA&M) system administration interface (\f4sysadm\fP). Sometimes
the command line equivalent procedure is described.
.IX "sysadm"
.IX "sysadm (see OA&M interface)"
.IX "OA&M interface"
.AB N
If the OA&M package isn't already installed, install the package 
using the \f4pkgadd\fP command, as described in Appendix D.
.AC
.AB C
If you ever need to alter information in the \f4/etc/passwd\fP file, always
do so via the OA&M interface. Never edit the file directly, 
or you may get locked out of your system. If you do not have 
OA&M installed, you can edit the \f4/etc/passwd\fP file, but you must 
then execute the \f4pwconv\fP(1M) command.
.IX "passwd file, editing"
.IX "pwconv command"

.H 1 "Using the OA&M Interface"
To invoke the OA&M interface, do the following:
.IX "OA&M interface, invoking"
.AL 1
.LI
Log in as root.
.LI
Type \f4sysadm\fP.
.LI
Enter the \f4sysadm\fP password if prompted for it.
.LI
Select the desired function(s) from the menus.
.LE
.IX "sysadm"
.AB N
If you aren't executing \f4sysadm\fP from the system console,
or if your terminfo
entry does not support function keys, the menus may be highlighted
differently and you may have to access the function associated with
a function key using other methods than described in this 
section. See
.ST "Other Ways to Use OA&M"
for more information.

The basics of using the \f4sysadm\fP menus follows:
.IX "sysadm, basics of using"
.BL
.LI
If you need help using a menu (and you installed the OA&M on-line help 
software), press
.HK F1 .
.LI
To select a menu, use the
.HK Tab
key or the arrow keys (if you invoke \f4sysadm\fP 
from an X window, and you have mouse support, you can use the mouse instead
of the
.HK Tab
or the arrow keys) to highlight the desired menu, then press 
.HK EK
or
.HK F3
to select the menu.
.LI
To move around within a menu, use the
.HK Tab
key to move to the next changeable
field, or use the arrow keys to move character-by-character within 
the field. 
.LI
The bottom of the screen shows which function keys you can use with the 
active menu. Only the most recently displayed menu is active.
.LI
To go up a menu level, press the
.HK F6
key.
.LE
.P
To exit the OA&M interface, do the following:
.IX "OA&M interface, exiting"
.AL 1
.LI
Press
.HK F7
to display the command menu.
.LI
Press
.HK e
to select the exit function.
.LI
Press
.HK EK .
.sp
The system prompt returns when the OA&M interface exits.
.AB N
The 
.BT "System Administrator's Guide"
gives more details
about using the OA&M menus and some of the functions described here.
.AC
.LE
.H 2 "Other Ways to use OA&M"
.IX "OA&M interface, alternate displays"
If your terminfo entry is set for other than the system console (for example,
the terminfo entry does not support function keys) the OA&M interface may work 
differently. You may notice the following differences:
.BL
.LI
When a menu is displayed, the menu item that is currently selected is supposed
to be highlighted. On some terminals, no items are highlighted or
more than one item is highlighted.
When this happens, look for the > symbol along the left side of the 
menu to determine which item is selected.
.LI
The 
.HK UA
and
.HK DA
keys are generally used to move up or down a line at 
a time in the menu. On some keyboards, the down arrow key 
.HK DA
invokes the HELP screen, the right arrow key
.HK RA
moves the cursor down a line, and the 
up arrow
.HK UA
moves up a line.
.LI
If your terminal type does not support function keys, you can execute
the function by pressing
.HK Ctrl-f
and the corresponding number. For 
example, the HELP button usually corresponds to 
.HK F1 .
To display the HELP message if your keyboard does not have function keys, 
press
.HK Ctrl-f
then press the
.HK 1
key.
.LE
.H 1 "Setting the System Date and Time"
.IX "date, setting the"
.IX "time, setting the"
One of the first things you should do after installing the software is to set
the system date and time.
The date and time are pre-set at the factory and may have the wrong time
zone set.
Every time you create or access a file, the date and
time the file was accessed is is attached to the file.
System accounting is also done using the
date and time.
So, it is important that the date and time are correct.
.AB N
This should be done when only root is logged into the system.
.AC
To set the system date and time, do the following:
.AL 1
.LI
Invoke the OA&M interface.
.LI
Select the \f4system_setup\fP menu.
.LI
Select the \f4datetime\fP menu.
.LI
Select the \f4set\fP menu.
.LI
Use the
.HK Tab
key to get to the desired field. You'll want to change the 
date, time, and possibly the timezone fields.
.LI
Use the
.HK RA
or
.HK LA
keys to get to the correct character.
.LI
Enter the desired information by typing over any data in the field.
.LI
Press
.HK F3
to save the information.
.LI
Exit the OA&M interface, as described earlier.
.LE
.H 1 "Adding Users to the System"
.IX "users, adding"
.IX "adding users"
To add users to the system, do the following:
.AL 1
.LI
Invoke the OA&M interface.
.LI
Select the \f4users\fP menu.
.LI
Select the \f4add\fP menu.
.LI
Fill out the desired information. You'll need to supply the username, userid, 
and other information.
(See the
.BT "System Administrator's Guide"
for more information, if necessary.)
.AB N
Be sure to create an account for yourself. Don't do regular work from 
the root account.
.P
When assigning the user ID, the system automatically displays the 
next available number as the default. Enter another user ID if desired,
or accept the default by leaving the field alone.
.IX "user ID"
.P
When specifying a group ID, add a valid group from \f4/etc/groups\fP 
or use the \f4add group\fP menu to add another group.
.P
.IX "group ID"
If you specified that the user has sysadm permission, it means that 
when the user logs in as sysadm, or types \f4su sysadm\fP, they are not 
prompted for a password.
.IX "sysadm, permission"
.IX "permission, sysadm"
.AC
.LI
Press
.HK F3
to save the input.
.sp
Another screen displays, asking you for the password.
.LI
Assign a password for the user.
.LI
Press
.HK F3
to save the input.
.sp
A summary of the input you just entered displays.
.LI
If you want to add another user, press
.HK F3
and repeat steps 4 through 7. 
Otherwise, exit the OA&M interface using the previously described procedure.
.LE
.H 1 "Restoring Files"
.IX "files, restoring archived"
.IX "\f4cpio\f1 command"
Once you have created user accounts and home directories, you can restore your 
personal System V Release 3.2 archived files with the \f4cpio\fP(1) command.
See the \f4cpio\fP(1) command in the
.BT "User Reference Manual"
for information. 
.P
The header format for the \f4cpio\f1 command is different in SVR4. To restore 
SVR4 files to a 3.2 system, you must use the options \f4-Hodc\fP of the 
\f4cpio\fP command, in addition to the options you would normally use.
.IX "cpio command, -Hodc options"
For example,
you may type a command such as:
.DS
.ft 4
cpio -iBcdumv -Hodc -I /dev/....
.ft 1
.DE
If you want to restore system files, you must do some special procedures, as
described next.
.H 2 "Restoring Pre-Release 4 System Files"
Many of the commands, system files, and directories from Release 3.2 UNIX 
(and earlier versions) have been moved to new locations in SVR4. Many of 
these files have been symbolically linked back to the old location.
.IX "symbolic links"
For example, the \f4/etc/hosts\fP file has been moved to \f4/etc/inet/hosts\fP,
and has been symbolically linked to the old location.
Many files have been completely
restructured and should not be restored to the SVR4 system, using the \f4cp\f1 command.
.P
Since it is difficult to determine which files can be restored and which
can't, we suggest that you restore the archived files to a temporary directory
on the SVR4 system. Then, you can restore the desired files, as needed,
once you are sure you will not damage your SVR4 system. 
.P
To restore the files you archived using the method described in Chapter 1, do 
the following:
.AL 1
.LI
On your SVR4 system, get in the \f4/usr\fP or \f4/var\fP directory.
.LI
Make a temporary directory in which to store the archived files, then change to 
that directory. For example, type:
.DS
.ft 4
mkdir save
cd save
.ft 1
.DE
.LI
Copy the files from the backup medium (make sure the medium is in the proper drive) to the SVR4 system by typing 
something like the following:
.DS
.ft 4
cpio -iBcdumv -I /dev/rmt/c0s0
.ft 1
.DE
The files are copied to the \f4save\fP directory. The \f4save\fP directory
should contain
entries such as \f4etc/hosts\fP and \f4etc/group\fP.
.LI
If you are sure that a file is compatible with the SVR4 system, you can copy the 
file to its new location on the SVR4 system.
.AB C
Do not use the \f4mv\fP(1) or \f4cpio\fP(1) commands to relocate the files. If 
you do, the symbolic links are destroyed.
.P
.IX "mv command"
.IX "symbolic links"
Copy files to their current (SVR4) location, not the old location.
.AC
For example, to relocate the \f4/save/etc/hosts\fP file to its proper place on 
the SVR4 system, while in the save directory, type:
.DS
.ft 4
cp etc/hosts /etc/inet/hosts
.ft 1
.DE
Since the \f4cp\fP(1) command does not destroy the symbolic link, the 
\f4/etc/hosts\fP file is actually copied to \f4/etc/inet/hosts\fP.
.LE
.H 1 "Setting Up a Local Area Network"
.IX "Local Area Network, establishing"
One of the first things to do when setting up a local area network is to
create a file that lists the IP address and system name of remote systems
you want to 
communicate with. You can either restore the \f4/etc/hosts\fP file you saved
from your pre-Release 4 UNIX system, as described in the previous section,
or use the \f4sysadm\fP menus to create a new hosts file.
.AB N
If a machine in your LAN already has a complete \f4/etc/inet/hosts\fP file,
put the machine's name and IP address in your \f4/etc/inet/hosts\fP file.
Then, use networking commands to copy the \f4/etc/inet/hosts\fP file over from
the other system. See the 
.BT "Network User's and Administrator's Guide
for more information.
.AC
.IX "IP address"
.IX "remote systems"
.IX "system, name"
.P
To set up a new local area network using the \f4sysadm\fP menus,
do the following:
.IX "sysadm, setting up LAN"
.AL 1
.LI
Find out the hostname and IP address of the other systems you want to
communicate with.
.LI
Invoke the OA&M interface.
.LI
Select the \f4network_services\fP menu.
.LI
Select the \f4name_to_address\fP menu.
.LI
Select the \f4inet\fP menu.
.LI
Select the \f4hosts\fP menu.
.LI
Enter the system name of the first system from the list of systems with 
which you want to communicate.
.IX "system, name"
.LI
Enter the IP address of the system.
.LI
Repeat Steps 7 and 8 until all the system names and addresses have
been entered.
.sp
When done, press
.HK F3
to save the data.
.LI
Exit the OA&M interface.
.LE
.P
If you have a lot of entries to make, you may want to use the
following short cut:
.AL 1
.LI
Log in as root.
.LI
Use the editor of your choice to edit the \f4/etc/inet/hosts\fP file.
.LI
For each host your system will communicate with, input a line that has the 
IP address of the system, followed by the host name. For example:
.SS CO
218.210.16.25 jackson jackson.intel.com
218.210.17.26 frodo frodo.intel.com
.SE
where \f4jackson\fP and \f4frodo\fP are host names, and \f4intel.com\fP is the domain 
names used by the mail utility.
.LI
After specifying all the hosts and IP addresses, save the changes made to 
the file and exit the editing session.
.LE
.H 1 "Backing Up the System "
.IX "system, backup"
.IX "backup, system files"
Once you have installed all the SVR4 packages you want, you 
may want to back up the system.
.P
To back up the system using the OA&M interface, do the following: 
.AL 1
.LI
Invoke the OA&M interface.
.LI
Choose the \f4backup_services\fP menu.
.LI
Follow the system prompts to back up the system to removable media.
.LE
.H 1 "Removing Packages"
.IX "packages, removing"
You can remove packages when you need more disk space on the system, or when 
you no longer need the package. There are two ways to remove packages, using 
the \f4pkgrm\fP(1) command, or using the OA&M interface.
To find out how to remove packages prior to doing an overlay installation,
see Chapter 1.
.IX "pkgrm command"
.AB N
System V Release 3.2 packages must be removed using the 
\f4removepkg\fP(1) command.
.P
If you are removing a package that another package depends on, you 
must remove the dependent package first, or the packages will not 
be removed correctly. Look at Table A-1 in Appendix A to see
package dependencies.
.AC
.H 2 "Removing Packages Using pkgrm"
.IX "removing packages, pkgrm command"
The \f4pkgrm\fP(1) command lets you remove selected packages, and gives you a chance 
to change your mind.
.P
To remove packages using the \f4pkgrm\fP command, do the following:
.AL 1
.LI
Log in as root.
.LI
Type \f4pkgrm\fP.
.sp
A list of packages on the system displays. The first column in the list is a 
number that corresponds to a specific package. You may have to press 
.HK EK
to see the complete list. When the entire list has displayed, you 
are told to select the packages you want to remove.
.LI
Enter the number or numbers that correspond to the package(s) you want to 
remove, or type \f4all\fP to remove all the packages.
If removing more than one 
package, use a comma and a space between the package names.
.sp
The specified packages are removed.
.LI
After the packages are removed, you must reboot the system before the changes can take effect.
.LE

.H 1 "System V Release 4 Packaging"
The SVR4 product consists of the Base System (including two boot diskettes),
several software sets (consisting of one or more optional packages), and
a few add-on packages.
.H 2 "Base System"
.IX "base system"
The Base System is the heart of the UNIX system; it is the only part
of the operating system that is not optionally installable.
Without it you do not have a UNIX System.
All of the add-ons depend on the Base System, that contains the
operating system kernel, the standard
device drivers, the most commonly used commands, and some basic utilities.
.H 3 "Boot Diskettes"
The first part of the Base System is on two diskettes called the Boot Diskettes.
These two diskettes are required, even if you are installing
the rest of the system from cartridge tape.
The boot diskettes you receive will depend on the type of hardware on which
you are installing the UNIX System:
.IX "boot diskettes"
.IX "diskettes, boot"
.IX "diskette, base system"
.IX "kernel"
.IX "base operating system, installing"
.IX "packages, optional"

Diskette 2: Base System Package Floppy Disk 2
.LE
.H 2 "Add-on Sets"
.IX Add-On Sets
.IX add-ons
Optional UNIX Operating System packages are divided into Add-On Sets.
Approximately two dozen packages of UNIX system software are
contained in these sets.
(See "Appendix A" 
for a list of the add-on sets.)
Each add-on package is separately installable and 
removable, although there are some
dependencies among add-ons. The add-ons contain 
a wide range of features, including
networking, editing, software development, terminal 
utilities, printer services, system administrative
services, as well as others. 
.CT "Appendix A"
lists the dependencies among add-ons, 
catalogs the add-ons that compose each set, and
describes of the features of each package.
.P
The add-on packages are divided into the following sets:
.BL
.LI
.IX BASIC Package Set
BASIC Package Set: This set contains packages that, though not required,
are usually installed on most UNIX systems.
They include: Editing Package, Terminal Information Package, Termcap Compatibility
Package, AT&T Windowing Utilities, Mouse Driver Package, Form and
Menu Language Interpreter, Operations, Administration, and Maintenance, LP Print
Service, Application Compatibility Package, and Network Support Utilities.
.LI
.IX NETWORK Package Set
NETWORK Package Set: This set contains networking-related packages.
They include packages that create distributed file systems (such as Remote File
Sharing and Network File System Utilities), provide network services (such as Internet
Utilities), and networking protocols (such as those contained in PC-Interface
and Remote Procedure Call Utilities).
.LI
.IX DEVELOPMENT Package Set
DEVELOPMENT Package Set: This set contains the Standard C Development
Environment package.
.LI
.IX EXTENDED Package Set
EXTENDED Package Set: This set contains the BSD Compatibility Package and the
Framed Access Command Environment Package.
.LI
.IX HARDWARE Package Set
HARDWARE Package Set: This set consists of packages that contain
hardware-specific drivers and utilities.  They include the WD8003 Ethernet
Driver, the Intel Ethernet Driver, the IE6 Ethernet Driver, and the Cartridge
Tape Utilities.
.LE
There are also several add-on packages that do not fall into a set.
(See the Add-on Packages described next.)
.H 2 "Add-on Packages"
The following add-on products are available, but are not included 
in any set:
.BL
.LI
Unlimited User License Package
.LI
Security Administration Utilities
.LI
Kernel Debugger Support Utilities
.LI
KDB Kernel Debugger
.LE
.H 2 "The Distribution Media"
.IX media (see distribution media)
.IX distribution media, 5 1/4 inch floppy diskettes
.IX distribution media, 3 1/2 inch floppy diskettes
.IX distribution media, cartridge tape
.IX floppy diskettes (see distribution media)
Your copy of the UNIX system is packaged 
in one of the three ways shown below. The content
of the three distributions is identical: each 
one contains the boot diskettes, 
the Base System Set and other
add-on sets, and a few additional add-ons.
Figure 1-1 illustrates the different media configurations.
.BL
.LI
3 \s-21/2\s0 inch 
(1.44 megabyte (MB)) floppy diskettes \(em This distribution consists of
(1) Two boot floppies, (2) the Base System Set floppies and five other sets
of floppies, and (3) a few additional add-on packages.
.LI
5 \s-21/4\s0 inch 
(1.2 MB) floppy diskettes \(em
This distribution is the same as the 3 \s-21/2\s0 inch
media distribution, except that, because each floppy holds less data, there
may be a few more floppies.
.LI
.IX cartridge tape
Cartridge Tape (60 MB streaming tape) \(em
the cartridge tape distribution includes (1) two boot floppy diskettes
(either 3.5 inch or 5.25 inch) (2) a cartridge tape containing the
Base System Set and five other sets and (3) a few additional add-on
packages on floppy diskettes (either 3.5 or 5.25).

.H 1 "Hardware Requirements"
Your system must meet the hardware requirements described below in order to 
install the SVR4 software:
.BL
.LI
Memory - Your system must have at least 4 MB of RAM. For most
applications, 8 or 16 MB of RAM is needed for adequate performance.
.IX "requirements, memory"
.LI
Diskette Drive Sizes - The diskette drives must be either 5.25 inch (1.2 MB) or 3.5 
inch (1.44 MB) 
.IX "requirements, diskette drive size"
.LI
Display Adapters - Your system must have one of the following display 
adapters with a compatible monitor: MDA, Hercules, CGA, EGA, VGA, or 
selected EVGA.
.IX "requirements, display adapters"
.LI
Hard Disks:
.DL
.LI
Disk Space: Your system must have at least 80 MB of disk space to run the 
base operating system. Look at Table A-1 in Appendix A to determine how 
much disk space your installation requires.
If necessary, install a bigger or 
additional hard disk to accommodate the packages you want to install.
.IX "requirements, disk space"
.LI
Disk Format: All target hard disks must be low-level formatted prior to
installation. Your hard disk is probably already low-level formatted by the 
manufacturer. If an operating system (UNIX or non-UNIX) is already installed
on the hard disk, it is safe to assume that the disk has already been 
low-level formatted.
.IX "requirements, disk format"
.P
Should your disk require it, Western Digital
and Adaptec provide a means to do a low-level format using 
the BIOS routines built into their SCSI and ESDI controllers. To do a low-
level format, boot DOS and execute the DEBUG program as described in the 
controller hardware manual that came with your system. You can also use 
Phoenix Technology's HDFORM command, or Storage Dimensions' Speed 
Store\(tm HARDPREP command to do the low-level format.
.LI
SCSI versus non-SCSI: If you are installing SVR4 from 
tape, you must use a SCSI tape drive if your hard disk drive is SCSI. If you 
have a non-SCSI system, the tape controller must be configured as shown in 
Table 1-2. After the operating system has been installed, you can change the 
interrupt and address, if desired.
.IX "requirements, SCSI vs. non-SCSI"
.LI
Multiple Disks: The SVR4 software can be installed on two hard 
disks, if desired. For example, the root and \f4/home2\f1 file systems can be on 
different hard disks. Both disks must be either SCSI or non-SCSI;
you cannot use 
one of each.
.IX "requirements, multiple hard disks"
.LE
.LI
Ethernet Boards - Table 1-1 shows you how the hardware must be configured.
In Table 1-2, the settings shown for the Ethernet boards are the recommended
defaults. If you want to use different settings for the Ethernet boards,
see the reference manual supplied by your hardware vendor for valid settings.
.LE
.IX "Ethernet, boards"
.AB W
Look at the hardware reference manuals for the equipment in 
question to see what the default settings are. Then, remove the 
cover of your computer to see if the settings match what is shown 
in Table 1-1 or 1-2. When the cover is open, you are exposed to 
dangerous voltages. To reduce the chance of severe shock, unplug the power
cords of your computer and all peripherals before 
removing the cover. Only qualified service technicians or system 
integrators should do these tasks.

General rules to follow when installing software
.LI
The primary installation steps
.LI
Tasks to do before beginning the installation.
.LE
.H 2 "General Comments"
Observe the following general rules when installing the software:
.BL
.LI
Installation of the SVR4 software should not affect any non-UNIX operating
systems or partitions that are resident on the target hard disk.
However, you should back up any non-UNIX files to be safe.
.LI
When the system prompts you for a response, type it in lower case (except 
where noted).
.LI
You can abort the installation procedure by pressing
.HK Del
at any prompt. You can then restart the installation process by typing
\f4INSTALL\fP (upper case is required).
The installation process restarts where you left off, or a few steps back.
However, if you abort the installation process, it is recommended that you
start the installation process at the beginning by rebooting from the boot
diskette.
.LI
Whenever you are presented with a choice, if you type anything other than 
the given choices, the system repeats the message until you enter a valid
response. 
.LI
All boot diskettes are write-protected. However, we still suggest that you 
make a backup copy of them for safety purposes. Appendix E describes how 
to copy the diskettes. (You do not need to write-enable the diskettes in order 
to use or copy them.)
.IX "diskettes, boot"
.LE
.AB C
Read the Release Notes included with your installation media before 
starting the installation. The Release Notes contain last-minute information
that may affect installation.

.H 2 "Overview"
The primary steps of the installation process are: 
.AL 1
.LI
Back up the user files and directories you want to save.
.LI
If you are doing an overlay installation, remove all packages first.
.LI
Boot the system using the appropriate boot diskette(s).
.LI
Select the package sets and packages you want to install. See Appendix A 
for a description of the function of the packages and to find out how much 
disk space is needed to install the packages.
.LI
If you are doing a new installation, partition the hard disk for the desired 
operating systems, select the desired filesystems and slices, and specify the 
filesystem type for each filesystem. If you are creating optional slices on the hard 
disk, see Appendix B for instructions.
.LI
Install the base operating system.
.LI
Assign the root and install passwords (new install only).
.LI
Assign the system name (new install only).
.LI
Install the packages as directed by the system. Answer the questions 
the system asks about the packages. Appendix C shows you what questions 
the various packages ask during the installation.
.LI
Reboot the system.
.LE
.AB N
The installation takes two to three hours if you are installing 
all the packages.
.AC
.H 2 "Pre-Installation Tasks"
Before you install the new software, you should back up 
any files you want to save. If you are doing an overlay installation, you must 
also remove all the packages. If you do not remove packages, the overlay
process will fail.
.H 3 "Backing up Pre-Release 4 Files"
.IX "backup, Pre-Release 4 files"
.AB N
This section only pertains to UNIX files, not files belonging to any 
other operating system.
.AC
Booting the SVR4 boot diskette makes your hard disk-resident UNIX files 
inaccessible. So, before using the SVR4 boot diskette, back up all user
files and directories you want to save using the \f4cpio\fP(1) command.
You may also 
want to save files in the \f4/usr/local\fP and \f4/usr2\fP directories
(if present), and system configuration files such as the \f4/etc/hosts\fP file. 
.IX "cpio command"
.AB N
It is faster to back up data to tape than to diskette.
Do not use the \f4backup\fP(1M) command to back up your SVR 3.2 files.
.AC
.AB C
Many system configuration files and commands have been moved, 
restructured, or contain different information in SVR4 than in SVR3.2. 
Restructured files are not compatible between the releases and 
should not be restored on the SVR4 system.
For example, if you back up your Release 3.2 \f4/etc/passwd\fP file and 
restore it to a SVR4 system, you will not be able to log in, because 
the system logins have changed. Other system configuration files, if 
restored, cause the system to behave in unexpected ways. Files that 
have been relocated must be restored by special means so that symbolic
links are not destroyed. So, before restoring any files to the
SVR4 system, read the section in Chapter 4 called
.ST "Restoring Files" .
.AC
.H 3 "A Backup Example"
The following procedure suggests a method for backing up your files.
.AL 1
.LI
On your SVR3.2 system, type:
.DS
.ft 4
cd / 
.ft 1
.DE
.LI
Create a file that contains a list of files you want to save. Use the full 
pathname of the files, but leave off the leading slash. For our example, 
we'll call the file containing the list "backup."
.P
For example, the backup file may contain entries such as:
.SS CO
etc/hosts
etc/group
.SE
.LI
Copy the files listed in the backup file to tape or diskette. For example, to 
copy the files to tape, type:
.ft 4
.DS
cpio -oBcvd -O /dev/rmt/c0s0 < backup
.DE
.IX "cpio command"
.ft 1
The files listed in the backup file are copied to the tape. The files can 
later be copied to any temporary directory you want on your Release 4
system. See
.ST "Restoring Pre-Release 4 System Files"
in Chapter 4 for instructions on how to restore the archived files.
.LE
.H 3 "Backing Up Release 4 Files"
To back up Release 4 files, use the OA&M interface, as described in Chapter 4.
.IX "backup, Release 4 files"
.H 2 "Removing Packages"
To remove packages prior to an overlay installation, use
the \f4RM.base.pkg\fP script. The \f4RM.base.pkg\fP script removes all
packages, no questions asked, so 
it works faster than any other method.
.IX "RM.base.pkg command"
.IX "packages, removing"
.P
To remove all the packages using the \f4RM.base.pkg\fP script, do the following:
.AL 1
.LI
Log in as root.
.LI
Type:
.DS
.ft 4
sh /usr/lbin/RM.base.pkg
.ft 1
.DE
As the packages are automatically removed, various messages display on 
the screen.
.LI
When all the packages have been removed, you are prompted to 
reboot the system.
When this happens, shutdown the system by typing:
.DS
.ft 4
shutdown -y -g0
.ft 1
.DE
.LI
When the system is down, turn off power to the computer.
.LE
.P
You are now ready to begin the installation process. Go to Chapter 2 or 3 to 
begin.
.IX "shutdown"
